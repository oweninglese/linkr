In the 1870s, representatives of the Crown and First Nations negotiated Treaties 1 to 7.
Each included provision for education. This study focuses on the intent and expectations

of education as a treaty right by the original signatories and the current divergent
understandings. Today First Nations demand the fulfilment of their treaty right to
education while Canada, despite constitutional authority and recent court decisions on
treaties, administers educational services within the boundaries of its own legislation:
the Indian Act. Honouring treaty commitments offers hope for educational opportunities
and equity within the context of First Nation governance, traditions, and cultural milieu.

L'article porte sur les droits des Premieres nations en matiere d'education, tels qu'ils ont
ete reconnus par les traites 1 a 7 conclus dans les annees 1870. Les Premieres nations

exigent les respect des dispositions des traites dans ce domaine. Mais en d6pit des
d6cisions r6centes des tribunaux, le Canada administre les services d'6ducation selon sa

Loi sur les Indiens. Le respect des obligations n6es d'un trait6 offre de l'espoir pour
l'enseignement et l'6quite dans le contexte de la gouvemance, des traditions et du milieu
culturel des Premieres nations.

From the time of early contact, representatives of First Nations and
European sovereigns entered into peace and friendship treaties. In 1752,
Grand Chief Cope of the Mi'kmaq and His Excellency Peregrine Thomas
Hopson, on behalf of the British Sovereign, agreed to articles of peace and

friendship outlined in the Mi'kmaq Compact. The Compact or Treaty

stipulated "the said Indians shall have all favour, Friendship & Protection
shewn them from this His Majesty's Government" and in exchange the
Mi'kmaq agreed to protect his Majesty's subjects from harm and "use their
utmost Endeavours to bring in the other Indians to Renew and Ratify this

Peace" (as cited in Cummings & Mickenberg, 1970, p. 307). Henderson,
Benson, and Findlay (2000) stated the "Mi'kmaq Compact created

boundaries for communities that respected their autonomous political and
legal systems. The compact constituted an integrated legal order based on
mutual obligations recognizing sharing, autonomy, and freedom of
association" (p. 137).
The early treaties and specifically the 1763 Royal Proclamation formed
the basis of Britain's treating with First Nations1, and although the British

North America Act united the British colonies as the Dominion of Canada

in 1867, the treaties continued to be recognized in Imperial law. In 1982,
Canada's Constitution Act ensured "The existing aboriginal and treaty

rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and
affirmed" (as cited in Isaac, 1995, p. 310). Thus when Canada, with the aid
of a loan from the British government, purchased the Hudson's Bay
Company's territory in 1869, the Imperial Crown required Canada to
ensure that
the claims of the Indian tribes to compensation for lands required for purposes of
settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles
which have uniformly governed the British Crown in its dealings with the aborigines.
(Rupert's Land Order-in-Council, as cited in Cumming & Mickenberg, 1970, p. 148)

Between 1870 and 1877, Canada, on behalf of the Imperial Crown, met
and negotiated Treaties 1 to 7 with First Nations from western Ontario to

the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Both Canada and First Nations
entered into negotiations with specific goals. The treaty commissioners
wanted to negotiate the transfer of land ownership to facilitate the
construction of the railroad and the settlement of European and Canadian
farmers and entrepreneurs in exchange for specific services (Morris, 1991 /
1880, p. 194). First Nations representatives, particularly during the Treaty
4 to 7 negotiations, wished to negotiate the peaceful sharing of their land
in exchange for services that would enable them not only to survive the
loss of their traditional lifestyle but also to participate fully in the new
economy (Treaty 7 Elders & Tribal Council, 1996, p. xi).
I argue in this article that the First Nation representatives who negotiated
the numbered treaties had an understanding of formal education and
expected their members and future generations to benefit from such
services. Formal education would enable First Nation communities to
supplement traditional educational practices with western teaching so they

could "live and prosper and provide" (Morris, 1991/1880, p. 28). The
Crown, however, did not fulfil its constitutional obligations and, from the

outset, chose to provide limited educational services not as a treaty right,
but as an assimilationist mechanism through its own criteria, the Indian
Act.

documentation relating to the provision of education within the context

of the negotiations and signing of Treaty 7. Treaty 7 Elders were
interviewed and while their comments are specific to Treaty 7, these
comments have general applicability to the numbered treaties. I have
centred my research on the rule of law, constitutional supremacy, and the
legal precedents relating to treaty rights that are applicable to the treaty
right to education.
TREATY PARTNERS

Two distinct societies, each with its own language and culture, met a
negotiated treaties, each believing that the other had fully understoo

the intent and purpose of the negotiations (Treaty 7 Elders & Tr
Council, 1996, pp. 126-127). The treaties would, however, be as much

symbol of misunderstanding as of mutual agreement. Over the n

century the two signatories debated the spirit and intent of the treat

and found little consensus in their understanding of the treaty negotiation

and specifically what the treaty right to education entailed. The issu
caused frequent dissension and at times conflict. The disparity solidi
as First Nations continued to maintain their right to education stemm
from reference in the numbered treaties, while the Crown chose to m
no reference to its treaty commitment and instead, relied upon the Ind
Act, its own legislation, to provide educational services, which were of
subservient to the Crown's financial priorities and national issues.
The Indian Act, which came into force in 1876, consolidated previo

colonial legislation and "impose[d] Euro-Canadian social organizati

and cultural values, [or] English common law" on First Nations (Carte

1999, p. 116). Subsequent amendments to the Indian Act formaliz
educational practices of the dominant society in order to "civilize
protect and cherish this helpless Race" (Dickason, 1996, p. 225). In thi
way, Canada established its own policy parameters and resource le

relating to the provision of educational services for First Nations.
Circumventing the treaties and its constitutional responsibility, Can
defined educational services in the Indian Act Section 114 to 122. Section

THE TREATY EDUCATION CLAUSE

Treaties 1 to 7 vary little from each other in the written form. In r

treaties give similar meaning in each statement relating to the treat
to education. The Crown's education commitment in Treaty 1, 1871,

"Her Majesty agrees to maintain a school on each reserve hereb

whenever the Indians of the reserve should desire it" (Morris, 1991 /

p. 315). From the outset, Treaties 1 and 2 established both the treaty

believed that education would enable First Nations to "live in comfort..

. [so] you can live and prosper and provide" (Morris, 1991 /1880, p. 28).
In order to do so, the Chief of Lac Seul requested a "school-master to be
sent them to teach their children" (Morris, 1991 / 1880, p. 49).

The oral and written accounts of the treaty negotiations add to an
understanding of the Crown's fiduciary responsibility to provide
educational services. At the North West Angle treaty meeting, Archibald's
successor, Alexander Morris, told the people gathered for the signing of
Treaty 3, "I will also establish schools whenever any band asks for them,
so that your children may have the learning of the white man" (Morris,

1991/1880, p. 58). Clarifying his statement, Morris added, "Whenever
you go to a Reserve, the Queen will be ready to give you a school and
schoolmaster" (p. 93). At the Treaty 6 negotiations, Morris stated, "[Yjour
children will be taught, and then they will be as well able to take care of
themselves as the whites around them" (p. 213). At this same meeting,
the Crees showed the influence of the Christian missionaries by listing

further context for the education clause, one Elder in my study stated,
"The missionaries taught everyone [adults and children]; that is what
our People understood formal education to be" ( p. 233). The Crown's
commitment to provide formal education (schools and instruction) built
upon community educational practices of life-long education and added
western formal instruction to traditional educational practices.
Our ancestors taught their children how to hunt, snare... [which] were our traditional

means of survival. Our [means of] survival were taken away from us and the
government promised us education for future success. The government is obliged to
provide education as the treaty said. (Carr-Stewart, 2001, p. 233)

CANADIAN GOVERNMENT INDIAN POLICY

David Laird, who replaced Morris as treaty commissioner, travelle
September, 1877, to Blackfoot Crossing for the Treaty 7 negotiat
Previously, minister of the interior from 1873 to 1876, he had been
involved in Canadian Indian policy. He championed the Indian Act t
Parliament, legislation that created a uniform approach "in contr
management of the reserves, lands, moneys and property of Indi
Canada" (Indian Act, 1876, sec. 2, as cited in De Brou & Waiser, 19

96). The act negotiated after the signing of Treaties 1 to 5 made no refe

to treaty commitments nor did it refer to schools or education, oth
in relation to the authority of Chief and Councils to establish rul
regulations for "the construction and repair of school houses" (India
1876, sec. 63 [6], as cited in De Brou & Waiser, 1992, p. 99). Was this
an oversight or intentional omission in the legislation by the Imp
government? Was the reference in the Indian Act to the Chief and Cou
authority to determine where and when to construct schools a reco
of First Nations' control and involvement in formal education?

The written treaties clearly stipulated the Imperial government's
responsibility to construct schools on each reserve when First Nations
requested it; however, when the Broken Head River First Nation, a member
of Treaty 1, requested a school, Laird's response indicated the government's
intent to minimize its commitment to the treaty provisions and clarified
the government's policy regarding school construction: "[T]he Government
is not bound under the Treaty to erect a schoolhouse on each Reserve, and
that the Government consider their obligation in this respect discharged
by the payment of a school teacher on each Reserve" (Provincial Archives
of Manitoba, MG.12.B2, box 2/4.934). Laird's written statement contradicts
the Crown's commitment in Treaties 1 to 5 to construct schools on each
reserve. As minister of the interior, Laird spoke on behalf of the government

of Canada when he responded to the Broken Head River First Nation. His
response indicated the government's policy decision to evade its obligation
to implement the Treaty commitment to school construction.

Laird was subsequently appointed governor of the North-West
Territories and the Crown's chief negotiator for Treaty 7. The wording
relating to education in Treaty 7 is very similar to that in his letter of
February 19, 1875. Treaty 7 states, "Her Majesty agrees to pay the salary of
such teachers to instruct the children of said Indians as to her Government

of Canada may seem advisable" (Morris, 1991/1880, p. 371). The Treaty 7
education clause makes no reference to school construction, only of the

A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO EDUCATION

The 1867 Constitution Act, section 91 (24), vested all legislative aut
for Indians and Indian lands in the federal government. As a resul
Nations education was defined as a federal responsibility and sep
from provincial responsibility for education (sec. 93). By the lat
century, law in Britain and Canada recognized the right of all chil
education within the context of English common law tradition: the
"obligation to individuals to educate children" was entrenched (Foley,

p.1). The right of all non-Aboriginal children to education was s
applicable to First Nations children as a part of their treaty and
constitutional rights and Canada was required to act in the children's best
interest. Although the Constitution identified the federal responsibility
for First Nations education, separate from provincial educational
responsibility, First Nations educational services arguably ought to be

services and educational resources - staff, schools, and material resources

- equitable with those provided by provincial educational systems. First
  Nations students were denied the educational programming and
  opportunities which facilitated similar achievement levels as their nonAboriginal peers. The separate educational system and lack of educational
  attainment was identified in a study of the 1921 Canada Census: "The
  Indians are only very slightly connected with the education efforts of the
  different provinces, the responsibility for their education lying with the
  Dominion and private denominational institutions (Dominion Bureau of
  Statistics, 1926, p. 38). Furthermore, the study stated the inclusion of literacy

statistics for the First Nations population in Canadian statistics as a whole

was "most misleading" (p. 38), particularly when Canada's educational
attainments were compared to other countries. Little changed over the
decades. McMurtry (1985) in a study of the 1946-1948 Joint Committee of
the Senate and House of Commons on the Indian Acts summarized the

general tone of the submissions on the state of First Nations schools:
Notoriously underfunded, poorly equipped and constructed, [and teachers were] paid

less than their colleagues in neighbouring public schools. The residential schools attracted
great criticism because of the half-day labor system [which] obliged the children to work

in the fields, sew, clean, etc. for several hours each day, thereby greatly restricting classroom

time. (McMurtry, 1985, p. 61)

The failure of the federal government to fulfil its constitutional and treaty

responsibility for First Nations education was raised in the House of
Commons:

While there are 130,000 Indians in the country, our education and training of these peop
take care of only about 16,000. Of this number enrolled, only 883 reach grade 7,324 rea
grade 8, and seventy-one reach grade 9. I notice in three of the provinces there are n

grade 9 students. (House of Commons Debates, 1946, p. 5489)

Two decades later, the gloomy picture of educational services and leve
were relatively unchanged. The demand for change was to erupt from
First Nations in part as a reaction to federal Liberal policy. In 1969, th
Liberal government, in search of a "just society," introduced a policy pap

reminded his audience of the Crown's treaty commitments: "Many mo

however, as a consequence of court rulings, before Canada paid heed
the treaties. It was ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada that brou

to the forefront the treaty agreements. Although the Court decisions hav
for the most part, dealt with the treaty right to hunt and fish, the cour
have looked at the totality of the event of treaty-making, not simply

specific words, and in so doing have established a more complete
understanding of the treaty-making process. Isaac (1995) wrote, "In
addition to actual terms of a treaty, the minutes of meetings at which
negotiations took place and events leading up to the signing of a treaty
have been interpreted to convey rights" (p. 236). To support his argument,
Isaac used the example of R. v. Taylor, 1981, in which the Ontario Court of

Appeal found that
[A]lthough the written terms of an 1818 treaty did not contain a guarantee of hunting and
fishing rights, the minutes of the council meeting between the Deputy Superintendent of
Indian Affairs and the chiefs of the six tribes who were parties to the treaty reveal that

hunting and fishing rights on Crown lands in areas covered by the treaty were retained
by the tribes. (p. 236)

The Sioui ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1990 also looked at
the totality of treaty-making. In making its judgement, the Supreme Court
referenced General Murray's 1760 letter to the Hurons in which the Crown's

representative assured them of the "free Exercise of their Religion, [and]
their Customs" (as cited in Isaac, p. 130). The Sioui decision upheld the
rights of the Huron descendants to practise their religion and customs in
their traditional locale because the intention of Murray's letter was to create
mutually binding obligations of primary importance. The Supreme Court's

1995, p. 306).

Although the Constitution Act did not define treaty rights, the
recognition of treaty rights solidified the government's fiduciary
relationship with First Nations dating back to the Mi'kmaq treaties and
the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and subsequent special relationships,
whether historical, political, legal, or socioeconomic which developed
between the Crown and First Nations people (Isaac, 1995, p. 167). The
Constitution Act gave "explicit protection for existing Aboriginal and treaty

rights" (Henderson et al., 2000, p. 337). Furthermore, Henderson et al.
argued that
The "promise" of section 35, as it was termed in R. v. Sparrow, recognized not only the
ancient occupation of land by Aboriginal peoples, but also their contribution to the building

of Canada, and the special commitments made to them by successive governments. The
protection of these rights reflects an important underlying constitutional value. (p. 337)

In 1982 Slattery (as cited in Isaac, 1995), wrote, "the Crown has a general
fiduciary duty toward native people to protect them in the enjoyment of
their aboriginal rights" (pp. 167-168). The courts in R. v. Guerin brought
the fiduciary responsibility of Canada in Aboriginal matters to the forefront.

The Supreme Court of Canada held that "the federal Crown must act in
the best interests of Indian peoples when dealing with Indian property
and lands" (Isaac, 1995, p. 167). Five years later, R. v. Sparrow further
defined the Crown's fiduciary responsibility. In his decision Judge Dickson
wrote:

The Government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with the respect to

aboriginal peoples. The relationship between the Government and aboriginals is trustlike, rather than adversarial, and contemporary recognition and affirmation of aboriginal
rights must be defined in light of this historic relationship. (as cited in Isaac, 1995, p. 169)

In December, 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada rendered one of the
most important legal decisions of the century in its ruling on the Gitksan

and Wet'suwet'en Aboriginal title in the Delgamuukw decision. The ruling
dealt with the issue of land title; however, various points of the Chief
Justice's statements are applicable in relation to education as a treaty right.

The Delgamuukw decision stated:
The Crown is under a moral, if not a legal duty, to enter into and conduct... negotiations
in good faith. Ultimately, it is through negotiated settlements, with good faith and give
and take on all sides, reinforced by the judgements of this Court that we will achieve ...
a basic purpose of s. 35 (1) - "the reconciliation of the pre-existence of aboriginal societies
with the sovereignty of the Crown." (as cited in Pape & Salter, 1998, p. 8)

courts are familiar with, which largely consists of documentary evidence. (Pape & Salter,
1998, p. 3)

The Supreme Court decision placed the oral history of First Nations
people parallel to the written word. The use of oral history was also upheld

in the 1999 Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Marshall. By acquitting
Donald Marshall Jr. of charges relating to fishing eels, the Court supported
the treaty right to hunt, fish, and gather as negotiated by the Mi'kmaq and
the Crown in 1752. The Court stated it "would allow this appeal [acquittal]
because nothing less would uphold the honour and integrity of the Crown

in its dealings with the Mi'kmaq people to secure their peace and
friendship" (Aboriginal Rights Coalition of British Columbia, 2002, p. 1).
The oral history of the people of the numbered treaties regarding what

was said and negotiated at the treaty meetings gained legal force as a
result of the Badger and Delgamuukw decisions, while the Marshall
decision reinforced the Crown's responsibility to ensure that negotiated
treaty rights are upheld and dealt with consistently, "even if it meant
disregarding federal regulations" (Aboriginal Rights Coalition of British
Columbia, 2002, p. 1).
THE DICHOTOMY

Two nations purposely entered treaty making, each to secure a
acceptable agreement, which resulted in the surrender of tradit
in exchange for reserve lands, one-time provisions, treaty paym
services including the provision of education. The treaty right to
was an incumbrance on the land transfer "for as long as the su
above and the water flows in the ocean" (Morris, 1991/1880, p. 9

independence of Aboriginal peoples in early North American relations
and has provided contemporary protection for treaties formed in the

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TREATY RIGHT TO EDUCATION

For First Nations, the treaties embody their solemn agreement and
relationship with the Crown. During Canada's century of avoidance of
the treaties, First Nations people kept the treaties alive and continued to
press, from time to time, for the fulfilment of the treaty promises,
particularly the treaty right to education. The chiefs and headmen who

signed the numbered treaties negotiated an educational right
complementary to their own Aboriginal teachings. Aware of the
instructional practices of the newcomers, they sought to supplement their
community educational practices with the linguistic and literacy skills of
the settlers. They were, however, dragged into an abyss and forced into
an educational system that sought to eliminate their traditional educational
practices, languages, culture, and customs, something that had not been a
part of the treaty negotiations.
Canada failed to implement the treaty commitment to education. The
government left the establishment of day schools to the initiatives of various

religious organizations. Canada's policy was to fund schools only after
they were constructed, usually by First Nations and missionary groups,
with the building materials acquired from the natural resources on the
reserves. In the late 1880s, Canada provided limited financial assistance
to religious entities towards the establishment of Industrial schools and
later Residential schools. These buildings, however, were usually located
on isolated areas of the reserve or off-reserve. Such schools not only denied

First Nations input into the schools but ignored the treaty commitment
that schools would be constructed on reserve whenever First Nations
desired.

The treaties promised a system of education equitable with the provincial

level and type of education provided for First Nations students ove

past century failed to provide equitable educational opportunitie

consequently failed to foster economic prospects for First Nations p
(Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, 1996a, p. 38).
In 1894, amendments to clause 11 of the Indian Act empowered t
governor-general-in-council to make regulations to enforce the atten
of Indian children at school; however, the government did not offic
incorporate the compulsory school attendance clause into the Indian

until 1920. Despite the government's own legislation requiring compu
attendance of all Indian children at school, it is clear from the minut

parliamentary commissions (McMurtry, 1985) that, as late as 1960, sc
facilities did not exist on numerous reserves across Canada. Schools th

did exist were often considered inferior to non-aboriginal sch

programming lacked financial resources; and, similarly, teachers' sala
were below provincial levels (McMurtry, 1985).
The 1970s marked a resurgence of the involvement of First Natio
people across Canada in the education of their children. First Nation

demanded appropriate quality educational services and "Aborig

peoples... explicitly question[ed] the existing educational system" (A
Dittbumer & Graham, 2000, p. 6). Although the Canadian govern
accepted in principle Indian Control of Indian Education (1972), it did
change its mode of administering education under the Indian Act. T
promise of a treaty right to education, the opportunity not only to
quality formal education but also at the same time to maintain their
linguistic and cultural identity, remained elusive, as did the opportu
for many First Nations people to participate meaningfully in the Can
economy.

In the later part of the 20th century, treaty First Nations began to assume

administrative control of educational services and schools on reserve;
however, in receiving funding from the department of Indian Affairs, they

Aboriginally controlled educational systems. (RCAP, 1996b, vol. 3, p. 684)

CONCLUSION

Reflecting recent rulings of the Supreme Court of Canada, t
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples recommended the recogn
education as a treaty right. Furthermore, the Royal Commission

First Nations "want two things from education ... the skills they
participate fully in the economy. . . [along] with the knowledge o
languages and traditions necessary for cultural continuity" (RCAP
p. 82), a goal similar to that the chiefs and headmen believed th
negotiated as a treaty right to education. To rebalance the politi

economic power between aboriginal nations and other Canadian
governments, RCAP recommended educational reforms must be
implemented immediately to remedy the gap between current educational
attainment and community needs (RCAP, 1996a, p. 82). Education must
reflect the structure, practices, and vision of First Nations communities.
Education is a treaty and constitutional right to be treasured and a process

that enables First Nations to blend traditional purposes of education,
language, and culture with the skills necessary for collaboration in today's
global society.
The issue of the demand for the recognition of education as a treaty
right will not dissipate until profound educational changes occur: including
appropriate funding and effective control beyond merely administrative

responsibility for a poorly funded and externally directed education
services. First Nations education must reflect the language, traditions, and
culture of their communities and receive the resources necessary to ensure
quality educational programming, and to ensure educational attainment
and foster the "crucial skills for governance and economic self-reliance"
(RCAP, 1996b, vol. 5, p.3). Only profound change, financial commitment,

and local control of education can eradicate a century of educational
neglect. It is time to honour the treaty commitment to education.
NOTES

1 Although the term Indian was used at the time the treaties were being negotiated,
I use the term First Nations interchangeably for purpose of this paper.
