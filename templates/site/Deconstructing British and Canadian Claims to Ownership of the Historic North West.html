Fantasies of Sovereignty:
Deconstructing [[British]] and
[[Canadian]] Claims to Ownership
of the Historic [[North]]-West</p>
<p>IN THE SETTLER-COLONIAL CONSCIOUSNESS of the nineteenth century, the origin of</p>
<p>­ anadian [[sovereignty]] in the historic [[North]]-West1 is the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Com­
C
pany’s transfer agreement with the Dominion of [[Canada]] in [[1870]]. This transfer agreement was a vital step in [[Canada]]’s self-understanding as a nation
a mari usque ad mare, from sea to sea. Negotiated in London under [[British]]
law, the transfer paved the way for [[Canada]] to populate the region with its
settlers and to act as the territory’s primary political authority. In exchange
for transferring these rights, the Company was paid £300,000 and received
a one-twentieth of the land of the “fertile belt” in this newly [[Canadian]] territory. All of this occurred without the involvement or consent of the [[Indigenous]] peoples who were still the numerical majority in the region. The transfer
agreement presumed that [[British]] [[sovereignty]] could be asserted successfully
through an act of imperial legislation half a world away, even if it conflicted
with local proprietary claims. This claim reaffirmed the imperial logic of the
day that [[Indigenous]] assertions of territoriality were secondary to [[Europe]]an
claims of [[sovereignty]]. Such a position has been roundly criticized,2 but has
never been fully deconstructed in its connection to claims of [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]] in the historic [[North]]-West. The purpose of this article is to unpack
this basic claim—that the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company ([[HBC]]) possessed legitimate
ownership of the [[North]]-West and could sell it to [[Canada]] in [[1870]] without the
involvement of [[Indigenous]] peoples who lived there.
Contrary to the claims of [[Europe]]an [[empire]]s, [[Indigenous]] peoples in the
[[North]]-West exercised more or less unconstrained political authority over
most of their lands both before and after [[1870]]. However, throughout the
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, [[British]] and [[Canadian]]
institutions mobilized a complex array of legal arguments to claim possession of huge expanses of territory they “discovered” but did not control. For
the most part, [[Canadian]] political institutions have traced their ownership
of the [[North]]-West to the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company transfer in [[1870]], which is
rooted in the problematic logic of the Doctrine of Discovery. Therefore, this</p>

<p>article shows that at the heart of [[Canadian]] claims to ownership of [[Indigenous]]
lands in the [[North]]-West lies an impractical mythology that, in the words of
John Borrows, allowed the [[Crown]] to secure legal control of [[Indigenous]] lands
through “raw assertion.”3 In demonstrating this point, I critically analyze five
major public political events that position the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company transfer agreement as the foundation of [[Canada]]’s [[1870]] assertion of [[sovereignty]]
over the [[North]]-West. These events include: (1) the [[British]] [[Crown]]’s initial discovery claim at Hudson [[Bay]]; (2) the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company Charter of [[1670]];
(3) the Selkirk Grant of [[1811]] and [[Treaty]] of [[1817]]; (4) [[Canada]]’s [[North]]-West
discovery via [[New]] [[France]]; and (5) the [[HBC]] transfer agreement in [[1869]]. This
article demonstrates that [[Canada]]’s political claims to ownership over the
[[North]]-West lay in problematic claims of [[sovereignty]] made by [[British]] and [[Canadian]] explorers, politicians, and businessmen, using language of discovery
and [[sovereignty]] to obscure [[Indigenous]] governance already in practice. These
claims are further complicated as they are more assertively invoked at the
moment of a settler-colonial transition in the [[North]]-West, and are bound up
in the changing status of an [[Indigenous]]-centered fur [[trade]] economy with a
new settler project that sought to displace [[Indigenous]] peoples from the land
both conceptually and physically.
In analyzing the theoretical underpinnings of these political articulations, I am less concerned with [[Indigenous]] responses to [[British]] and [[Canadian]]
claims making (although there were many), or the historiography of interpreting such events, than I am in showing that [[Canada]]’s political claim to the
[[North]]-West ultimately rests on what James Tully refers to as a hinge proposition. A hinge proposition is a foundational assumption that is “relatively [[immune]] to direct criticism” because it is part of the “background norms” used
by political actors to understand their political community, and thus rarely
subjected to critical analysis.4 The idea that [[Canada]] exercises exclusive jurisdiction over the “[[Canadian]] West” is premised largely on a fantasy that
[[Europe]]ans found a continent full of primitive peoples who receded from the
advance of a politically sophisticated civilization, rather than complex [[Indigenous]] polities with intricate political institutions capable of controlling political events in their territories. The hinge in this proposition is that if we recognize that [[Indigenous]] peoples are not inherently inferior to [[Europe]]ans, as a
growing number of scholars contend,5 then [[Indigenous]] political formations
ought to be considered political powers in their own right. If we accept such a
logic, we must then call into question how [[Indigenous]] peoples ceased to govern themselves and control their territories and how [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]]
became ascendant.6 Thus, for [[Canada]] to be able to sweep aside pre­existing
[[Indigenous]] political authority, it must rely on a fantasy of [[sovereignty]], predicated on an inherent inferiority of [[Indigenous]] political formations that could</p>

<p>easily be unhinged from their territories and replaced by foreign systems of
power. Yet, long after the arrival of [[French]] and [[British]] [[empire]]s to the continent, [[Indigenous]] peoples retained control of the region. Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company entities, like Red River’s Council of Assiniboia, saw frequent [[Indigenous]]
disruptions and challenges to their authority.7 In more remote areas, when
fur [[trade]]rs ventured beyond the walls of fur [[company]] forts even into the late
nineteenth century, they did so by integrating themselves into [[Indigenous]]
social and political formations rather than presiding over them.8 Whatever
the on-the-ground reality of life in the historic [[North]]-West, [[British]] political
institutions relied on a foundational moment of discovery to justify their
claims to territorial ownership and political authority.</p>
<p>The Doctrine of Discovery and Underlying [[Crown]] Title
The area historically referred to as the [[North]]-West is home to Assiniboine,
Blackfoot, [[Cree]], Dakota, Dene, Lakota, Métis, Saulteaux, and other peoples,
who long marked the social and political landscape with shifting governance
patterns and diplomatic relationships. Into the mid-nineteenth century these
peoples thrived in an efficient and well-stocked buffalo economy, provisioning the fur [[trade]] with meat and skins. Over time, buffalo numbers declined
and settler populations increased, leading to [[treaties]]—and conflicts—with
the settlers, which defined the contours of [[Canadian]] Confederation and the
increasingly marginal place of [[Indigenous]] peoples “within” [[Canada]].
Despite this long [[history]] of [[Indigenous]] presence in the [[North]]-West, the
fantasy of [[British]] (and later [[Canadian]]) possession of the [[North]]-West is rooted
in the “discovery” of [[Indigenous]] lands by foreign “explorers.” While the Doctrine of Discovery is a well-known legal precept, it is necessary to provide a
brief description here. Discovery is a [[Europe]]an legal convention that allowed
[[Europe]]an [[empire]]s to imagine possession of “new” territories already inhabited by other people, establishing [[property]] and [[sovereignty]] over lands previously unknown to [[Europe]]an [[empire]]s.9 Even though most [[Europe]]an explorers
were aware that the lands they discovered were long inhabited, discovery
was premised on the myth that [[Indigenous]] peoples possessed an inferior
relationship to their territory and had a weaker form of political authority
that could be overridden by the presence of [[Europe]]an political power. Their
land was considered terra nullius, “legally ‘vacant’ and ‘unused,’ and open to
appropriation by [[Europe]]ans.”10 As a result, [[Europe]]an [[empire]]s claimed superior political authority over [[Indigenous]] territories by their simple discovery
of those lands. Such a rationale allowed [[Europe]]ans to simultaneously understand the “[[New]] World” as a fully peopled landscape full of preexisting political units and at the same time construct a legal logic that made these political</p>

<p>entities legally inferior to the political powers of [[Europe]]an [[empire]]s. Discovery
is premised on a number of settler-colonial assumptions about what Patrick
Wolfe calls “dominion without conquest.” For Wolfe, the “conceit of discovery, when pompous navigators proclaimed dominion over whole continents
to trees or deserted beaches,” long predated the practical ability to realize
“the final securing of [[Europe]]an settlement.”11 Lorenzo Veracini also suggests
that settler [[sovereignty]] is “typically imagined before it is practiced,”12 which
means that discovery claims were made credible only after they could be actualized by settlers on the ground, at which point these claims could then be
retroactively projected onto the past. Therefore, in times of settler-colonial
ascendency, like today, formerly improbable claims to territorial ownership,
like those in the nineteenth-century [[North]]-West, can be reconceptualized as
a long-standing [[sovereignty]] over an untamed wilderness.
At its core, then, discovery claimed to disrupt [[Indigenous]] ownership, allowing the discovering [[empire]] to envision itself, in an obvious legal fiction,
as the original occupant of [[Indigenous]] lands, and thus in possession of a
superior and underlying title.13 From the moment of discovery, [[Indigenous]]
landholding was said to diminish full [[Indigenous]] control of the landscape to
something less than private [[property]] ownership.14 [[Indigenous]] peoples were
said to have retained their right to “use the land and hold it against third parties, but their interest [was] subordinate to the [[Crown]]’s underlying title.”15
Discovery, however, never claimed to invest total control of [[Indigenous]] peoples in the [[Crown]]; it also had important legal limitations that placed limits on
the discoverer’s political power. [[British]] law, for instance, did not allow its institutions to unilaterally impose [[government]] on [[Indigenous]] peoples. [[British]]
colonial [[government]]s were empowered only to govern interactions between
[[British]] subjects; it did not extend over relationships between [[Indigenous]]
­peoples, at least until they signed an extinguishment [[treaty]] or otherwise
consented to be protected by the [[Crown]].16 Underlying title also did not eliminate [[Indigenous]] use rights to discovered territories, but reimagined those
use rights as existing at the pleasure of the [[Crown]].17
In terms of the discovery of the [[North]]-West, it was first claimed by the
[[British]] upon the formal discovery of the shores of Hudson [[Bay]] in [[1668]] by two
[[French]] explorers, men commissioned by the English king to sail into the [[Bay]]
and map the surrounding lands and river mouths. Medard des Groseilliers
and Pierre-Esprit Radisson’s act of mapping these shores and waterways constituted the ceremonial act of discovery and claimed underlying [[Crown]] t­ itle
to the lands they contained. Although this initial mapping “yielded no understanding of the interior or of the [[Native]] peoples who lived there,” the act
of rendering unknown lands cognizant to [[Europe]]an [[empire]]s and renaming
the landscape after [[British]] people and places provided the basis for claims of</p>

<p>underlying title to the drainage under English law.18 As it was practiced in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the discovery of the mouth of a river
was equated with the discovery of all of the river’s tributaries and the lands
that drained into them.19 This ceremony of discovery, then, also resulted in a
discovery claim to all lands that drained into these rivers, including those far
away in the interior, most specifically, the [[North]]-West.</p>
<p>The Charter of the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company
The discovery of [[Western]] [[Canada]], then, originates in the Hudson [[Bay]] where,
after the mapping of the mouths of “new” rivers in [[1668]], [[King]] Charles II
granted to his cousin Prince Rupert and some other aristocrats large tracts
of land in the [[Bay]]’s drainage in [[1670]], through “The Royal Charter of the Company of Adventurers Trading into Hudson’s [[Bay]],” more commonly known as
the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company Charter. Although at the time of discovery little
was known about the extent of this region, the Charter granted the Company exclusive right to [[trade]] in furs on “all the Lands, Countries and [[Territories]], upon the Coasts and Confines of the Seas, Streights, [[Bay]]s Lakes, Rivers,
[[Cree]]ks and Sounds” that empty into the Hudson [[Bay]], “which are not now actually possessed by any of our [[[British]]] Subjects or the Subjects of any other
Christian Prince or State.”20 Most important for our purposes, the Charter
also provided the Company with the political authority to govern these lands
and the [[British]] subjects inhabiting them, granting the Company the power
“to make, ordain, or establish, any such Laws, Constitutions, Orders, and Ordinances, in such Form as aforesaid, shall and may lawfully impose . . . such
Pains, Penalties and Punishments upon all Offenders, contrary to such Laws,
Constitutions, Orders and Ordinances . . . for the better Advancement and
Continuance of the said Trade.”21 The Charter, according to Darren O’Toole,
theoretically invested “legislative, executive and judiciary powers” in the
Company, generating the first [[Europe]]an [[government]] in the drainage,22 and
theoretically establishing underlying [[Crown]] title to [[Indigenous]] lands, protecting the region from the claims of other [[Europe]]an [[empire]]s.23 Despite the
confidence with which the Charter was written, the truth was that in [[1670]]
no Englishman had seen most of the lands claimed by the document.24 Its
power and legal force originated in [[Europe]], and flowed from the king’s sovereign will, claiming to establish these adventurers as “the true and absolute
Lords and Proprietors, of the . . . Territory,”25 to be the bulwark of [[British]] imperialism over these vast, legally vacant lands. While [[British]] knowledge of
the lands of the Hudson [[Bay]] drainage would grow over time, an increase in
knowledge of the area did little to embed [[Europe]]an control, as ownership and
control were not premised on knowledge, but rather on the practical ability</p>

<p>to govern and a prior occupation of the territory. In fact, as the knowledge of
the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company increased, so too did its knowledge of the political
power of [[Indigenous]] peoples populating the region.
In these early days, the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company’s claim to the drainage was
contested primarily by the [[French]] [[Crown]], which had established a physical
presence in the seventeenth century through a small [[trade]] network that rivaled the English presence, even though both remained insignificant compared to the extensive [[Indigenous]] population in the region. As time went
on, [[Europe]]an knowledge of the interior of the drainage grew considerably,
although as Michael Witgen notes, “The [[empire]]s of [[Europe]] could, at times,
in[[flu]]ence the peoples and events in the interior, but most of the continent lay
beyond their control.”26 While the [[French]] maintained for much of the eighteenth century a distinct claim to have discovered the region, the [[French]] colonial apparatus was eventually turned over to the [[British]] in [[1763]], putting to
rest any non-[[British]] competition to discovery of the drainage.
Because of its abstract nature, the discovery claim of the [[Bay]] had little
impact on the lives of those peoples already living in the drainage in [[1670]], or
for a great many years after that. It was also never accepted, as we will see,
by the [[French]] [[Crown]], or [[Canadian]] rivals in the fur [[trade]] like the [[North]] West
Company.27 The immense in[[flu]]ence of the Charter, however, did not reside
in its ability to assert itself on top of [[Indigenous]] polities or against imperial
rivals, but in its ability to motivate and justify the colonial ambitions of [[British]] [[trade]]rs, and later the Company’s settlers. In the Charter, Company men
found the confidence to act on the [[sovereignty]] of their king in lands far away
from their own, over which they could initially claim little control.
Despite its grandiose claims, the Charter was a document that motivated
[[British]] [[trade]]rs more than it affected [[Indigenous]] peoples on the ground. The
Charter was the basis for English law and [[British]] governance in the [[North]]West and was identified as such in the Company’s legal codes. It defined the
basis for, and extent of, Company governance, as well as asserting the right of
[[British]] underlying title through discovery. However, throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth century the Charter served more to motivate [[Europe]]ans to [[trade]] on [[Indigenous]] lands, not settle them, and [[trade]] occurred largely
on [[Indigenous]] terms. Despite the lofty claims of the Charter, the [[British]] in
the drainage were more than willing to live by [[Indigenous]] protocols, practice
[[Indigenous]] kinship obligations, and participate in [[Indigenous]] diplomacy, as
was often necessary to engage in the fur [[trade]].28 Because of these on-theground relationships, the Charter alone proved insufficient for justifying
[[British]] presence in the region, and [[Indigenous]] peoples sought specifically defined relationships with the fur [[trade]]rs and settlers in their midst.</p>

<p>“By Annual Present of Quitrent”:
The Selkirk Grant of [[1811]] and the Selkirk [[Treaty]] of [[1817]]
In the early nineteenth century, the first permanent community of settlers
in the [[North]]-West was established at Red River, and constituted a first attempt at settler-colonial ascendency in the [[North]]-West.29 For the first sixty
years of its life, the Red River Settlement was also the lone community of the
[[North]]-West with significant [[Europe]]an settlement, so it is not surprising that
attempts to assert [[British]] governance were most pronounced there. Settler
claims to [[sovereignty]] in the Red River valley can be traced to [[1811]], when the
Company granted a large portion of the [[North]]-West to the [[Scottish]] Earl of
Selkirk from its own Charter grant. Selkirk, a major investor in the [[HBC]], had
bought enough shares to generate a Company-backed yet Selkirk-governed
speculation scheme, envisioning the settlement of [[Scottish]] farmers in the
Red River valley to provision fur [[trade]]rs with grain from the [[North]]-West
rather than the [[British]] Isles. This [[1811]] grant to Selkirk was premised on the
Company’s claim that it was in “good right, full power and lawful and absolute
­authority . . . to convey and assure the land, hereditaments and premises,” as
“absolute Lords and Proprietors of all the Lands and [[Territories]]” that drained
into Hudson [[Bay]], as conveyed by the Charter.30 Thus empowered by their
Charter, the Company transferred 116,000 square miles of what was then
called Assiniboia, along with the authority to govern it, to Selkirk. Selkirk received this grant for the paltry sum of “ten shillings of lawful money of [[Great]]
[[Britain]],” providing only that Selkirk make progress in settling the region after ten years and did not interfere with the Company’s fur trading activities.31
Despite the grant’s claim to own and govern the landscape, it did little to
establish actual [[British]] [[sovereignty]] in the region. Even with the reiteration
of the Company’s absolute proprietorship over the land in his grant, the Company and Selkirk’s relatively weak political standing in the region left these
settlers at the mercy of [[Indigenous]] peoples already there. Despite Selkirk’s
confidence in the grant from the Company, he was also keenly aware of how
vulnerable his settlement actually was. In [[1811]] Selkirk sent instructions to
Miles Macdonell, the first governor of the Red River [[colony]], requesting that
the first party of settlers disguise themselves as the staff of a new trading
post to hide the permanency of the settlement, and that they hire a wellknown [[trade]]r to help maintain the illusion.32 Knowing ultimately that the
settlement could not exist without [[Indigenous]] consent, Selkirk later wrote
Macdonell advising that “when it can no longer be concealed that the establishment is to be permanent, if the jealousy of the [[Indian]]s appears to be
roused, the proposal of purchasing the land must be brought forward.”33 Selkirk’s fears were realized in the summer of [[1816]], when Métis soldiers, upset</p>

<p>about the infringement on their hunting economy by the colonists, began
dispersing Selkirk’s settlers and reasserting themselves as the descendants
of the original inhabitants. When Selkirk’s [[representative]] Robert Semple
confronted a party of Métis, a skirmish broke out resulting in the [[death]] of
Semple and twenty other colonists. While colonial officials in England may
have viewed the [[death]]s of the settlers at the hands of the Métis as an affront
to [[British]] control over the region,34 Selkirk ultimately found it impossible to
hold any of the Métis party responsible under [[British]] law. Despite Selkirk’s
claims to govern the Red River valley, he was ultimately forced to seek the
consent of local [[Indigenous]] peoples to protect his [[colony]], as the authority of
Selkirk’s Grant had little bearing on events on the ground.35
After this conflict with the Métis, Selkirk and his agents met with five
chiefs representing the local Saulteaux and [[Cree]] bands in order to settle diplomatically any misapprehension about the future of the Red River Settlement, and the subsequent negotiations led to Selkirk’s [[Treaty]] in [[1817]].36 The
surviving written document notes that five signatory chiefs from [[Cree]] and
Saulteaux bands agreed with Selkirk “to give, grant and confirm unto our
Sovereign Lord the [[King]], all that Tract of Land adjacent to Red River and Assiniboyne River, beginning at the mouth of the Red River and extending along
the same as far as [[Great]] Forks,” for “the use of the said Earl of Selkirk, and
of the Settlers being established there.”37 In exchange, Selkirk would “annually pay to the Chiefs and [[War]]riors” a “Present or Quitrent” of “one hundred
pounds of good and merchantable Tobacco” from Selkirk, his heirs, and successors.38 In Selkirk’s’ mind this document, coupled with the [[1811]] grant, established him as the lone political authority in Red River valley—or at least
two miles on either side of the Red and Assiniboine rivers. The Selkirk [[Treaty]],
in this view, legitimated [[British]] governance in the new Red River Settlement
and forever established [[sovereignty]] over [[Indian]] lands there. Under [[British]]
common law, because [[Indigenous]] peoples were said to continue to possess
certain residual use and occupancy rights on their territories after discovery,
agents of the [[Crown]] were still required to negotiate for the extinguishment
of all “residual” [[Indian]] title to newly discovered lands in order to establish
full and uncontested [[sovereignty]].39 This rationale, of extinguishing inferior
title as a burden on the [[Crown]]’s superior title, was how Selkirk envisioned
[[treaty]] making.
But [[Indigenous]] peoples, unwilling to accept that [[Britain]] could claim ownership over their lands, thought of [[treaty]] making in a much different way. For
the Saulteaux, Selkirk’s [[Treaty]] did not clearly establish [[British]] claims to the
lands40 and it did not extinguish their title to the land.41 Selkirk’s view of the
[[treaty]] was bitterly contested by Saulteaux leaders for years afterward, who
argued that the [[treaty]] was actually a rental agreement, not a land cession.</p>

<p>Exa[[mining]] the [[treaty]]’s somewhat ambiguous language, the Saulteaux
rental-arrangement interpretation seems to be in keeping with much of the
written agreement. Regardless of Selkirk’s interpretation, the [[treaty]] did not
clearly result in extinguishment of [[Indian]] title to the region. What is particularly telling in this regard is the language describing this exchange as a “quitrent” relationship. Quitrent relationships, a common custom in Selkirk’s day,
were a feudal practice in which a tenant farmer paid “an annual fixed and
heritable charge upon the land.”42 Older feudal conventions required peasants to contribute labor toward public works and military duties defined by
their lord, but by the nineteenth-century, in order to maximize their profitability, many estates consolidated all these various feudal duties into fixed
quitrents, or regular payments that replaced all other obligations.43 As a feudal institution, quitrent explicitly recognized the ownership of the land by
the feudal lord as well as institutionalizing a specific relationship between
lord and tenant. It was generally understood in the nineteenth century that
quitrent did not transfer the land title to the tenant and the land remained
the [[property]] of the feudal lord.44 For Selkirk, himself a land-owning nobleman in [[Scotland]], would have understood intuitively the language of quitrent. Selkirk preferred the language of “quitrent,” noting in his journal that
“a large quantity of goods . . . offered for the purchase it might be said that
the temptation of immediate advantage had induced them to sacrifice their
permanent interests. [He] would therefore propose to them merely a small
annual present in the nature of a quit rent or acknowledgement of their
right.”45 He likewise considered annual presents as a way of ensuring an ongoing relationship defined in a [[treaty]]. Selkirk wrote in [[1811]], “An annuity to
be annually distributed among the tribes and families who have a claim to
the lands, will form a permanent hold over their peaceable behaviour, as they
must be made to understand that if any individual of the tribe violates the
[[treaty]], the payment will be withheld.”46 As Selkirk was concerned about the
sustainability and ongoing nature of the agreement, annuities would ensure
its long-term viability and provide an incentive for his [[treaty]] partners to uphold the agreement. This second concern also demonstrates the weakness
of the infant [[colony]]’s ability to assert itself, and that presents and annuities
were more effective in protecting [[British]] interests on the ground than were
the claims of Selkirk’s Grant.
The local [[Cree]] and Saulteaux chiefs, who saw a small annual present as
an acknowledgment of their ownership, justifiably understood the [[treaty]] as
a kind of rental agreement. Selkirk, as the party paying this annual “gift” to
the five chiefs to use the land, seems to accept the role of the tenant responsible for paying the quitrent to the landlord in exchange for use rights. The
Selkirk [[Treaty]], then, rather than ceding [[Indigenous]] lands to the [[Crown]], or</p>

<p>perpetuating a fantasy of underlying title, may have succeeded more in reinforcing the position of the [[Cree]] and Saulteaux signatories as the landlords of
the Red River region, recognizing their prior possession of the [[North]]-West.47
The [[treaty]]’s emphasis on quitrent also undermines Selkirk’s claim to have
purchased the territory outright, as any future claim to [[British]] ownership of
the Red River valley is in clear conflict with a quitrent relationship.
This interpretation is also consistent with how Saulteaux chiefs understood the [[treaty]]. Chief Peguis, one of the [[treaty]]’s signatories, was adamant
that the [[treaty]] outlined an annual rental agreement for this tract of land. In
[[1859]] Peguis gave a formal statement, recounting that “no final bargain was
made; but that it was simply a loan . . . I say positively the lands were never
sold.”48 Peguis’s son, Henry Prince, likewise told a Métis assembly in [[1869]] that
“the land had only been leased and the annual gratuity now paid . . . by the
[[HBC]] was part of the rental.”49 From the perspective of Peguis and his son,
the [[treaty]] did nothing to change the ownership of the land in the Red River
valley, which continued to rest with the [[Indigenous]] peoples rather than with
Selkirk, the Company, or the [[Crown]].
The fact that Selkirk even negotiated for land that the Company already
claimed ownership of through [[British]] discovery also tells us much about the
lack of authority of the Charter and Selkirk’s Grant. Mere assertion of the
possession of land by Selkirk and the Company did not convince the local [[Indigenous]] peoples of the Company’s right to possess and occupy the land. The
existence of this [[treaty]] actually testifies to the [[Crown]] and Company’s weak
political authority. [[Donald]] Gunn, the Red River settler and prominent Company critic, made this very argument in The Nor’-Wester in [[June]] [[1860]]. Gunn
argued that the weakness of the Charter’s claims meant that the [[HBC]] was
required to gain [[Indian]] consent through [[treaty]] making. If the Company felt
differently, Gunn asked, why the farce of buying the land with the Selkirk
[[Treaty]]? The Company knew full well that “the [[Indian]]s have a prior and superior claim to any which the Company can set up.”50 Though perhaps the most
telling commentary on the Selkirk [[Treaty]]’s validity comes from the [[Canadian]]
[[government]]. In [[1871]], while negotiating [[Treaty]] 1—on the same lands that Selkirk’s [[Treaty]] were supposed to have ceded to the [[Crown]]—[[Canada]] chose to
ignore Selkirk’s [[Treaty]] and negotiate as if there was no prior [[treaty]] relationship, an act unnecessary if the [[Canadian]]s considered Selkirk’s [[Treaty]] to have
extinguished [[Indian]] title and asserted [[Crown]] [[sovereignty]] in the Red River
valley.51
Regardless of what Selkirk believed, for the [[Indigenous]] peoples of the
[[North]]-West the status of the Selkirk [[Treaty]] was that of a long-term rental
agreement resulting in colonist use rights, not [[sovereignty]]. Rather than
solid­ifying the presence of the Company’s authority, the Selkirk [[Treaty]] was</p>

<p>a document that could not live up to its claims. What the Selkirk [[Treaty]] did
establish, even if it was only on a quitrent basis, was the legitimacy for a sedentary [[Europe]]an agricultural settlement, which could assume reasonably
safe tenure of the land they were farming. Tellingly, Selkirk’s settlement
was made possible by a [[treaty]], which sought consent of the local [[Indigenous]]
peoples, rather than a document that claimed ownership through discovery. From the perspective of most [[Indigenous]] people in the region, Selkirk’s
[[Treaty]] left their relationship to the [[North]]-West almost entirely unchanged.
Whatever its status, after Selkirk’s [[death]] and a failure to turn a profit on this
settlement scheme, the grant was sold back to the Company in [[1835]], and the
Company continued to pay the quitrent to the [[Cree]] and Saulteaux chiefs u
­ ntil
the transfer in [[1870]].52 But ownership insecurities of the [[North]]-West persisted as different colonial bodies attempted to claim grant as its own. These
debates bubbled to the surface in [[1857]] as the [[British]] [[Crown]] sought to deal
with the contest over the Company’s ownership of the [[North]]-West among its
own subjects.</p>
<p>[[Canadian]] Claims of Discovery at the [[1857]] Select Committee
on the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company
By the mid-nineteenth century the social dynamics that made the Company
the vanguard of [[British]] [[colonialism]] in the [[North]]-West were shifting, and new
imperatives of [[empire]]-building were emerging. These new social in[[flu]]ences
were conspiring to replace the governing colonial joint-stock [[companies]]—like
the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company—with settler-colonies directly tied to the [[Crown]].
In the Victorian era, notions of agrarian progress more than ever drove the
[[British]] desire “to tame the world’s remaining wilderness regions and manage
them for the desires of humanity.”53 The prevailing discourse on civilization,
and its equation with settlement, expansion, and market-oriented agriculture, was changing social discourses in [[Canada]] and [[Britain]], and this very distant ideological led to an intimate challenge of [[Indigenous]] governance in the
[[North]]-West. This era also saw a sustained challenge to the existing fantasy
of [[British]] [[sovereignty]]—pitting two [[British]] colonial [[government]]s with profoundly different colonial orientations against one another, and resulting in
new claims by the Colony of [[Canada]] to ownership over the [[North]]-West.
It was in this shifting ideological context that [[British]] Parliament formed
the Select Committee on the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company in [[1857]]. Its mandate was
to review the activities of the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company and assess the Company’s ability to spread [[British]] civilization by [[foster]]ing agricultural settlement and Christian missionization of its territories.54 Another obvious goal
of the Select Committee was to determine the [[North]]-West’s suitability for</p>

<p>permanent colonial settlement and to assess the fitness of the Company’s
governance to accomplish this end.55 The Select Committee created a political space for the [[North]]-West, or at least its “fertile belt,” to be imagined as
a settler-colonial space, much as Selkirk had attempted to do in Red River.
During its hearings, the Committee received testimony from a diverse group
of witnesses, including those who had a direct interest in the outcome of the
Select Committee’s report. Thus Company men claimed the territory’s frozen landscape was unsuitable for agricultural settlement and that it was best
that it remained a fur-harvesting region with an [[Indigenous]] majority under
ostensible control of the Company. They were challenged by pro-settlement
witnesses who argued that the Company’s failure to treat the [[North]]-West’s
[[Indigenous]] peoples fairly had demonstrated that the Company was a poor
moral force to encourage [[Indigenous]] peoples to become civilized Christian
agriculturalists.56
One outcome of the Select Committee’s hearings was the establishment
of a narrative of [[Canadian]] settler [[sovereignty]] over the [[North]]-West, in defiance of both [[Indigenous]] people and the Charter, developed by [[Canada]]’s [[representative]], William Henry Draper. In his testimony submitted on behalf of
the Colony of [[Canada]], Draper argued that the Company’s discovery claim to
the [[North]]-West “was no more than a claim” and was superseded by [[Canada]]’s
rightful possession of the region.57 Draper’s arguments were intended as the
basis for a legal challenge to the Company’s possession of the [[North]]-West,
a plan that [[Canada]] later abandoned. Nonetheless, Draper’s evidence provides valuable insight into how [[Canadian]]s viewed their relationship to the
then-distant [[North]]-West, and how they would lay claim to it in the future.
Draper’s main argument was that the Colony of [[Canada]], through the Doctrine of Discovery, rightfully possessed the fertile belt of the [[North]]-West,
a vast territory bounded “on the south by the [[United]] [[States]]’ boundary; on
the west by the Rocky Mountains; on the north by northern branch of the
[[Saskatchewan]]; on the east lake by Lake [[Winnipeg]], the Lake of the Woods,
and the waters connecting them.”58 To make such claims, of course, Draper
rejected the Company’s claim of discovery to all lands draining into Hudson
[[Bay]]. Through Draper’s testimony and submissions to the Select Committee,
the [[Canadian]] colonial legislature expressed its own fantasy of possession,
adopting “a very strong opinion that a considerable portion of the territory
occupied or claimed by the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company will be found to lie within
the proper limit of that Province [of [[Canada]]].”59 Draper’s claim shows the degree to which the [[Canadian]] colonial leadership had, as early as [[1857]] if not
before, imagined a legal right to settle the fertile belt of the [[North]]-West as
its own territory despite no meaningful presence there. In challenging the
Company’s claim to the [[North]]-West, then, Draper did not problematize the</p>

<p>57</p>
<p>legitimacy of the Doctrine of Discovery as a way of dis[[missing]] the Company’s
claims; rather, he relied heavily on the doctrine to produce a second, supposedly superior discovery claim to the [[North]]-West. What Draper aspired to do
was assert this alternative claim of discovery to allow [[Canada]] to assume possession of the region and to repopulate it with [[Canadian]]s. Consistent with
past discovery practices, Draper’s imaginings never directly addressed the
preexisting [[Indigenous]] authority in the [[North]]-West. Rather, Draper’s documents appear to be primarily concerned with disputing the claims of the
Company, which he probably considered as the lone [[Europe]]an entity in the
region to be the only political authority that mattered.
Draper’s argument rests on the assumption that during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries the Company’s claim to the [[North]]-West was preempted by competing [[French]] claims that predate actual [[British]] occupation.
Just like Charles II, the [[French]] [[Crown]] claimed the Hudson [[Bay]] drainage by
right of discovery.60 While the Company claimed through discovery the entire Hudson [[Bay]] drainage by the act of mapping the [[Bay]]’s shores in [[1668]],
[[New]] [[France]] claimed it by extension of the territories originally settled on
the St. Lawrence beginning in [[1627]]. [[New]] [[France]], Draper claimed, had always
stretched to the “[[North]]ern Sea,” what the English called Hudson [[Bay]]. Draper’s
written submission recounts how, as a result of these contradictory claims
of discovery by English and [[French]] agents, there was regular conflict during
their first two hundred years at the [[Bay]]. During this period, there was a series of skirmishes in the Hudson [[Bay]] straits, where fur [[trade]] forts changed
hands, or were sacked and burned; as the two [[empire]]s fought over access to
the lucrative fur [[trade]] there, [[trade]] was interrupted to the benefit of neither
party.61
The [[French]] and English [[companies]] sought a nonmilitary solution to end
this rivalry. Most important for Draper, during the eighteenth century the
Company announced its willingness to negotiate a clear boundary between
the two competing claims—a diplomatic stance that the Company denied
in the nineteenth century.62 Draper claimed that prior to [[New]] [[France]]’s absorption into the [[British]] [[empire]] in [[1763]], the conflicting claims of the two
[[Crown]]s led to several attempts by [[French]] and [[British]] interests to establish
a clear north–south boundary line that would separate the more northerly
Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company Territory from the [[French]] territory of [[Canada]] in the
south. In one instance, Draper showed that the Company suggested a demarcation line between Forts York and Albany, which was near the 53rd degree
of latitude.63 The Company explicitly stated that this proposed compromise
should not be seen as limiting its larger claim to the entire drainage unless
the [[French]] agreed to accept the proposed border, yet Draper interpreted
the Company’s offer to compromise as an acceptance that its claim to the</p>

<p>NAIS 3:1 [[2016]]</p>
<p>southern parts of the drainage was weaker than that of [[New]] [[France]]. Draper
argued that because the Company was willing to compromise on its territorial claim with [[French]] [[Canada]] and effectively alienate the southern parts of
the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Territory in the eighteenth century, this contradicted the
Company’s nineteenth-century claims to the entirety of the [[North]]-West.64
Draper specifically challenged the Company’s claim that it possessed, by right
of discovery, the fertile belt because the [[French]] had maintained a presence in
these regions long before. He therefore claimed that [[French]] [[Canada]] had an
eighteenth-century presence in the fertile belt of the [[North]]-West, with forts
at “Lake St. Anne, called by older geographers Alenimipgou; at Lake of the
Woods; Lake [[Winnipeg]], and two, it is believed, on the [[Saskatchewan]].”65 Using
this knowledge, Draper constructed an alternative narrative of discovery for
the southern regions of the [[North]]-West that made [[Canada]] the inheritor of
[[New]] [[France]]’s superior claim to discovery of the [[North]]-West.
In [[1627]], Draper argued, well before the [[HBC]] Charter of [[1670]], [[King]] Louis
XIII of [[France]] chartered a [[company]] to settle, govern, and [[trade]] in [[Canada]].
In [[1663]] this [[company]] surrendered its charter to [[King]] Louis XIV, and [[Canada]]
became a [[Crown]] [[colony]] of [[France]]. In [[1671]] this [[colony]] sent out men to explore
lands to the north and the west, where the “Sieur de Lusson returned after
having advanced as far as 500 leagues [1,500 miles] from here, and planted a
cross, and set up the kings arms, in presence of 17 [[Indian]] nations assembled
on the occasion from all parts, all of whom voluntarily submitted themselves
to the dominion of his Majesty, who alone they regard as their sovereign protector.”66 While this expedition’s success was almost certainly exaggerated
on all counts,67 Draper argued that its presence, as well as the establishment
of early fur [[trade]] posts, allowed the [[French]] to realize their discovery claim to
the southern reaches of the Hudson [[Bay]] drainage, which the Company “had
not penetrated when [[Canada]] was ceded to [[Great]] [[Britain]] in [[1763]], nor for many
years afterwards.”68 This claim of [[French]] occupancy allowed Draper to argue
that the [[North]]-West was discovered and possessed by [[France]] prior to the
cession of the [[French]] [[colony]] of [[Canada]] to [[Britain]] in the [[1763]] [[Treaty]] of Paris.
Furthermore, because the [[Crown]]s of [[Britain]] and [[France]] maintained these
separate claims to the same territory over a hundred-year period, Draper
argued that the Colony of [[Canada]] ultimately inherited these claims from
[[New]] [[France]]. As a result of the Seven Years’ [[War]] and [[France]]’s [[1763]] cession of
[[Canada]] to the [[British]], [[France]]’s claim was supposedly transferred to [[British]]
[[Canada]] with the [[Treaty]] of Paris.69 Draper thus concluded that the Colony of
[[Canada]] inherited [[France]]’s title to the southern regions of the [[North]]-West, including Red River, which was discovered and occupied by “[[Canadian]]s” (even
if they were in reality [[French]] Canadiens) before the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company
could establish an effective presence there. This meant that, at least in the</p>

<p>59</p>
<p>mind of Draper and his [[Canadian]] colleagues, the lands claimed by the Company in the fertile belt of the [[North]]-West actually belonged to [[Canada]] by
right of discovery and occupation. This [[French]] discovery therefore entitled
[[Canada]] to repopulate the [[North]]-West with [[Canadian]] settlers, without regard
for the Company’s claims under its Charter.70
Supposedly supporting Draper’s arguments are two statutes—the [[Canada]] Jurisdiction Act, [[1803]], and the Regulation of the Fur Trade Act, [[1821]]—
which established that capital crimes committed in “[[Indian]] territory” and
the [[North]]-West were to be tried in Lower [[Canada]] and Upper [[Canada]], respectively.71 Such statutes would imply that legal jurisdiction over the [[North]]-West
was already established by [[Canada]] in a country it claimed as its own. However, in response to this threat, the Company repeatedly refused to send its
servants east to face trial, and asserted its own legal capacities in its place.72
Only one individual accused of a capital crime in the [[North]]-West was sent to
the [[Canada]]s under either statute, and, as Hamar Foster argues, the Company
preferred to overlook violent offences rather than acknowledge that Rupert’s
Land fell under [[Canadian]] legal jurisdiction.73
From an [[Indigenous]] standpoint, however, [[Canada]]’s claim was just as fantastical as the Company’s, since it was entirely divorced from the reality of
[[Indigenous]] political authority as it existed in the [[North]]-West. A few fur [[trade]]
posts, regardless of who operated them, could not create a broad claim to the
territory superior to those who lived there—or more important the right to
repopulate it with settlers. Nor could these claims compete with [[Indigenous]]
political independence, which had very different standards of territorial legitimacy. In his “Last Memoir,” Louis Riel identified land ownership as part of
an intergenerational [[Indigenous]] inheritance as a kind of precondition for the
legitimate possession of territory: “One’s native land is the most important of
all things on earth. Above all it is made holy through the ancestors who pass
it on. To take it away from the people it gave birth to is as abominable as to
tear a mother from her little [[child]]ren at the time they need her most.”74 Riel
also rejected other claims to territory that lack this intergenerational attachment to land, which he saw as the primary means through which legitimate
possession of land is expressed. Abstract claims like discovery were not valid
sources of territorial legitimacy. Riel notes that justice, at least from a Métis
perspective, does not allow “a stronger people to snatch away the homeland
of a weaker people”; human con[[[[science]]]] condemns such acts as “criminal and
its grievous consequences are many and difficult to measure.”75 For Riel, the
theft of someone else’s territory is “the greatest sacrilege,” leading to further
evil acts and great suffering.76 Thus ownership of land fell to those who inherited it by birth—[[Indigenous]] peoples of the [[North]]-West—rather than those
who claimed it through more abstract means.</p>

<p>NAIS 3:1 [[2016]]</p>
<p>While Draper’s discovery narrative of [[Canada]]’s right to the [[North]]-West
was flimsy, even by the standards of [[British]] law, its explanatory power resonated elsewhere. Draper succeeded in crafting a powerful fantasy that
justified unrestricted [[Canadian]] settler-colonial expansion. Much like the
Company’s claim empowered Company servants to colonize their supposed
possessions in the drainage, [[Canada]]’s narrative legitimated the expansionist drive of [[Ontario]], generating a sense of entitlement to settle the southern
regions of the [[North]]-West.77 When Ontarians moved there, they began to express these settler-colonial sentiments in the bluntest of ways. Red River’s
paper, The Nor’-Wester, was pro-annexationist and [[Canadian]]-owned, and
it readily seized on Draper’s fantasy of [[Canadian]] discovery as the basis for
large-scale [[Canadian]] settlement in the area. In a [[July]] [[1867]] issue celebrating
[[Canadian]] Confederation, The Nor’-Wester reprinted a letter from the Duke of
Buckingham, which more or less restated Draper’s [[1857]] argument:
When the Charter of the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company was granted by Charles the
Second in [[1670]], the Valleys of the Assiniboine, [[Saskatchewan]], and Red River,
formed a part of La Nouvelle [[France]], and were in the possession of subjects of
the [[French]] [[King]], by virtue of Charter granted by Louis the Thirteenth, [in] [[1626]].
They had erected forts and established hunting stations in many parts of the
territory. By the conquest of [[Canada]] this territory came into possession of the
[[British]] [[Crown]] and shortly afterwards [[British]] subjects resident in [[Canada]] engaged in the fur [[trade]], and carried out their enterprise through the [[North]] West
Territory to the shores of the [[Pacific]].78</p>
<p>This rationale also allowed the paper to [[editorial]]ize on the eve of [[Canada]]’s attempted [[1869]] purchase of the [[North]]-West: “We believe this territory belongs
to [[Canada]], it is her just right, and that she is best adapted to advance the interests of this people and to carry us onward in a career of prosperity u
­ nder
civil [[liberty]] in its truest sense; and we don’t beat around the bush saying
so.”79 Regardless of the accuracy of Draper’s argument, with its underlying
assumption that [[Indigenous]] political authority did not matter, [[Canada]]’s fantastical claim to the [[North]]-West was adopted as the creed of settler-­colonial
expansion and the fantasy was disseminated through the expansionist press
to the general public back in [[Canada]].
Despite its future in[[flu]]ence, Draper’s argument proved unconvincing in
London. The memorandum Draper submitted to the Select Committee was
never referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, as he claimed
it would be, and the argument was later abandoned by [[Canada]] in its attempt
to secure the [[North]]-West under [[British]] law.80 The Select Committee also
seemed unconvinced by Draper’s claims, and in what was perhaps a nod to
the Company’s authority, suggested that this dispute should be resolved at
a future time.81 Despite its shortcomings, the [[Canadian]] fantasy of discovery</p>

<p>in the [[North]]-West remained a powerful narrative for [[Canada]]’s increasing
settler-­colonial drive. It allowed all manner of rationalization for annexation,
and even provided rationale for the belief that the territory was already part
of [[Canada]] and thus under the scope of [[Canadian]] [[government]].82 This understanding is perhaps the greatest source of the troubles with the Métis at Red
River in [[1869]]–70. It certainly provoked the Métis, who were [[bomb]]arded
with stories about unfettered [[Canadian]] settlement in their homeland in
the lead-up to the Red River Resistance. [[Canada]]’s claim to discovery of the
[[North]]-West, inherited through [[New]] [[France]], thus served the same legitimizing and motivating purpose for [[Canadian]] annexationists that the Charter did
for Company men. Without being able to account for actual political authority established and expressed on the ground, [[Canadian]] insistence on the recognition of [[French]] discovery and their inheritance of [[New]] [[France]]’s territorial
claims was the fantastic legitimizing logic of the [[Canadian]] [[North]]-West settlement drive.</p>
<p>“Taken from under Their Feet”:
The Legislative Appropriation of the [[North]]-West in the [[1860]]s
With the failure of Draper’s reasoning to convince imperial politicians of [[Canada]]’s underlying ownership of the [[North]]-West, the [[colony]] switched tactics
by the late [[1860]]s, and attempted to secure the Company’s claim to the region
through [[British]] constitutional channels.83 In [[1865]] delegates from the [[Canadian]] colonies, including John A. Macdonald and George Etienne Cartier, were
visiting London to discuss the possibility of a colonial union in [[British]] [[North]]
[[America]] and opening up the [[North]]-West to [[Canadian]] immigration.84 The [[Canadian]] delegates expressed a desire to the [[British]] [[government]] to purchase
the Company’s claim to the [[North]]-West in the quickest possible manner to
prevent [[America]]n annexation and, unlike in [[1857]], were now willing to compensate the Company for whatever Charter rights may exist in the [[North]]West.85 As a result of these meetings, in [[December]] [[1867]] the new [[Canadian]]
Parliament was able to petition the [[Crown]] to fulfill settler colonial desires
to extend [[Canada]] “westward to the shores of the pacific ocean” into the “unorganized territories” of the [[North]]-West, because “the colonization of the
fertile lands of the [[Saskatchewan]], the Assiniboine, and the Red River districts . . . are alike dependent upon the establishment of a stable Government
for the maintenance of law and order in the [[North]]-[[Western]] [[Territories]].”86
In response to this request, the [[British]] and [[Canadian]] [[parliament]]s passed
a package of legislation allowing the lands to be unilaterally “transferred”
­between [[British]] entities to allow for settlement, all without involvement of
the [[Indigenous]] peoples. The transfer of the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company’s claim</p>

<p>to the [[North]]-West to the Dominion of [[Canada]] in [[1869]] was justified by three
pieces of legislation: two imperial statutes, the Rupert’s Land Act ([[1868]]) and
the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act ([[1867]]); and one [[Canadian]] bill, the Act for the
Temporary Government of Rupert’s Land ([[1869]]). Under [[British]] law, this legislation was said to be sufficient to unilaterally transfer the possession of
a vast peopled landscape from one authority of [[empire]], the Hudson’s [[Bay]]
­Company, to another—[[Canada]].
In [[July]] [[1868]] [[British]] Parliament initiated what it believed would to be a
simple transfer of territory with Rupert’s Land Act, which cleared the way
under [[British]] law for the admission of Rupert’s Land as a new territory in the
Dominion of [[Canada]]. The Act rested on the pleasure of the [[Crown]] to transfer
the right to land and governance “upon such Terms as Her Majesty thinks fit
to approve,” while also formalizing the surrender to the [[Crown]] all the Company’s “Lands, Rights, Privileges, Liberties, Franchises, Powers, and Authorities” to be later transferred to [[Canada]].87 Such a legislative move, like the
Charter before it, relied on the investiture of underlying title to [[Indigenous]]
lands in the [[Crown]]. Since it has already been established that this was based
on a questionable claim of discovery in [[1668]], it is difficult to imagine that the
[[Crown]] could claim ownership of the [[North]]-West from the Company whose
own control to the territory proved so tenuous. None of these entities (as
the Red River Resistance in [[1869]]–70 soon demonstrated) could actualize
its governance or ownership of the land if [[Indigenous]] peoples rejected it.
Like most preceding legal understandings, the Rupert’s Land Act presumed
the [[Crown]] could initiate the transfer through unilateral legislation “upon
such Terms and Conditions as shall be agreed upon by and between Her Majesty and the said [[Governor]] and Company.”88 The substantive details of the
agreement for the transfer came after a series of private London meetings
in late [[1868]] between [[representative]]s of [[Canada]] and the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company, and mediated by the imperial [[government]]. Both parties ultimately
agreed to a surrender of the Company’s claims in the region in exchange
for a one-time payment of £300,000 from [[Canada]], as well as a land grant
to the Company of one-twentieth of all land within the fertile belt near the
Red River Settlement, including the land around the Company’s current fur
[[trade]] posts. The Company would be left with land in fee simple that totaled
about fifty thousand acres. It also received guarantees from [[Canada]] that it
would not experience unnecessary limitations on its economic activities in
the [[North]]-West.89 It should be noted that [[Canada]] had not entirely given up
its claim to the fertile belt through [[French]] discovery outlined in [[1857]], and,
as Kent M
­ cNeil notes, this deal only extinguished the Company’s “possible
claims,” because even at this stage “[[Canada]] did not admit the validity of the
Company’s claims by agreeing to this settlement.”90 Like the drafting of the</p>

<p>Rupert’s Land Act, these meetings were devoid of any actual involvement of
people on the ground; underlying [[Crown]] title through discovery presumably
rendered their participation unnecessary.91 What was agreed on, however,
was that [[Canada]] inherited the responsibility “to make adequate provision
for the protection of the [[Indian]] tribes whose interests and well-being are
involved in the transfer,” which it would do through initial [[treaty]] making
followed by extensive and violent settler-colonial policies.92 This meant that
[[Canada]] would be left to deal with whatever residual title was still possessed
by [[Indigenous]] peoples living in this now-[[Canadian]] territory. This responsibility, however, did not necessitate [[Indigenous]] input in the larger question
of the transfer a
­ greement.
Once these terms were agreed on, the Rupert’s Land Act allowed the Dominion of [[Canada]] to annex the [[North]]-West through a preexisting clause in
the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act, [[Canada]]’s constitution at the time.93 Section
146 of the BNA Act permitted the transfer of any [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies and territories to the Dominion of [[Canada]], including the Hudson’s [[Bay]]
Company’s territories.94 Darren O’Toole argues, however, that section 146 did
not treat all colonies in the same way, but rather envisioned two categories
of colonies that would be added to Confederation, using different processes.
The incorporation of what amounted to settler-colonies like Prince Edward
Island, [[New]]foundland, and [[British]] Columbia required [[Canada]] first to obtain
“the acceptance of their respective Legislatures before the Imperial [[Crown]]
could admit them as members of the [[Canadian]] federation.”95 But neither the
Rupert’s Land Act nor the BNA Act required “a legal obligation to consult . . .
the inhabitants of the territories”; in fact, “the only legal mechanism that was
available to the inhabitants was that of petitioning the [[Crown]], but this did
not in any way limit the [[Crown]]’s prerogative.”96 This meant that according to
[[British]] law, in order for [[Canada]] to annex the West and govern it as a settler-­
[[colony]] of its own, it did not need the consent of the [[Indigenous]] ­peoples of the
[[North]]-West who had never surrendered their governing authority to [[Crown]]
or Company. Under the colonial pretensions of [[British]] law, the only legal requirement for [[Canada]] was the passage of legislation in its own [[parliament]]
that incorporated this new territory and its peoples into [[Canadian]] jurisdiction unilaterally.
In addition to these two [[British]] statutes, a third piece of legislation authorized [[Canada]] to take possession of the [[North]]-West. Unlike the previous
two, this third Act was a piece of [[Canadian]] legislation, signed into law in [[June]]
[[1869]]. Known as the Act for the Temporary Government of Rupert’s Land,
this statute bridged the Rupert’s Land Act and section 146 of the BNA Act,
legalizing, on behalf of the queen, the admittance of “Rupert’s Land and the
[[North]]-­[[Western]] Territory into the Union or Dominion of [[Canada]].”97 The Act</p>

<p>also provided for the appointment of a lieutenant–governor of the territory,
the Conservative politician William McDougall, “to make provision for the administration of justice therein, and generally make, ordain, and establish all
such Laws, Institutions and Ordinances as may be Necessary for the Peace,
Order and good Government of Her Majesty’s subjects and others herein.”98
In addition to an appointed head of [[government]], the Act also provided for “a
Council, not [to] exceeded fifteen nor less than seven persons,” to aid in the
administration of the territory.99 Since the Act stated that the Council was to
be appointed by the lieutenant–governor rather than being elected by the
local citizenry, it combined both elective and governing functions of the territory in a single person.100 It was, as Red River [[trade]]r Alexander Begg described
it, “a fine Family Compact idea,” akin to the oligarchical system of colonial
[[government]] that Ontarians themselves had thrown off in [[1837]]–38.101 Despite
this contradiction, and lacking any involvement of the people who were actually in control of the vast [[North]]-West, these legislative processes seemingly
satisfied the Dominion of [[Canada]] of its legitimate possession of the [[North]]West. In short order it appointed William McDougall in [[September]] [[1869]] to the
post of lieutenant–governor, who expected only “an imperial entrance into
the settlement and an unpacking of his extensive luggage at the large house
rented for him.”102 It was likely a big surprise to a number of [[Canadian]] and
[[British]] politicians when he was met at the border, as the [[representative]] of the
new [[Canadian]] authority in the [[North]]-West, by a party of armed Métis with
a message from their leadership that he was forbidden from entering the
­country until they, “the [[government]]” of the country, deemed it a
­ ppropriate.103
While [[Canada]] and [[Britain]] may have been mostly willing to ignore Métis
political existence in Red River, its early attempts to put the transfer’s legislation into practice proved impossible since it did not have the political or
military capacity to displace or absorb [[Indigenous]] polities. The Métis-formed
Provisional Government at Red River condemned both the Company and the
transfer agreement in [[1869]], with a public repudiation of the validity of the
transfer in the Declaration of the People of Rupert’s Land and the [[North]]-West,
stating that it was impossible for the Company to sell “all the rights which it
had pretended to have in this territory” in a transaction “which the people
were considered unworthy to be acquainted.”104 Since this Company’s transfer was not legitimate in the eyes of the Métis-run Provisional Government,
the Métis were then “free and exempt from all allegiance to that [[government]]”; at the same time they “refuse[d] to recognize the authority of [[Canada]],
which pretends to have a right to govern and impose on us a despotic form of
[[government]] still more contrary to our right and interests as [[British]] subjects,
than was that [[government]] to which we had subjected ourselves through necessity up to a recent date.”105 This sentiment was not merely confined to the</p>

<p>Métis political elite. During the [[1869]]–70 Resistance, a reporter from The
Globe interviewed Métis guards at Fort Garry, who questioned how the Company gained the power to buy and sell [[Indigenous]] land: “Your [[Canada]] Government offered to pay £300,000 to the Hudson[’s] [[Bay]] Company for the Rivière
Rouge Territory. Now what we want to know, and we will not lay down our
arms till we know what they meant to buy. Was it the land? If so, who gave
the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company the right to sell the land? When did the [[Canada]]
Government bought the land did they buy what was on it? Did they buy us?
Are we the [[slaves]] of the Hudson[’s] [[Bay]] Company?”106 Simply put, the transfer did not impart the legitimacy of [[Canadian]] [[government]] among the Métis,
nor alter their allegiance to traditional authority structure, nor even deter
­Métis soldiers from forcing [[Canadian]] [[government]] officials out of the country. Whatever the justificatory narratives used in the Imperial Rupert’s Land
Act and BNA Act, as well as [[Canada]]’s Act for the temporary [[government]] of
­Rupert’s Land, [[Canada]] very quickly found out what the Company had known
for decades, that it could not do much in the [[North]]-West without the blessing
of [[Indigenous]] peoples.
The Métis were not the only [[Indigenous]] nation to express doubts about
the validity of the transfer, in fact, criticism of the transfer resurfaced repeatedly in [[treaty]] negotiations throughout the [[1870]]s. During [[Treaty]] 4 negotiations, for instance, the Gambler, a Saulteaux spokesperson, [[protest]]ed
to the [[Crown]]’s [[Treaty]] Commissioner, Alexander Morris that “the Company
have stolen our land.”107 Another headman later demanded that his people be
paid the £300,000 [[Canada]] paid to the Company for what was, in effect, the
land of his people.108 During initial [[Treaty]] 4 negotiations, “unhappiness over
the Rupert’s Land transfer” caused the First Nations leadership to refuse a
pipe ceremony with the [[Crown]]’s negotiators—the precursor to proper [[treaty]]
making on the prairies—then declined to negotiate with the [[Crown]] for five
days.109 Even though the transfer agreement satisfied [[British]] and [[Canadian]]
legal necessities, the transfer’s legislative package did little to transform actual political authority in the lands it claimed to annex, or the opinions of
the people who lived there. They were, in reality, unilateral acts by a foreign
power, which at the time had little substantive effect on still-independent
[[Indigenous]] peoples.
In general, [[Indigenous]] people did not recognize the legitimacy of the
Charter, the transfer agreement, or other unilateral pronouncements of governance by outsiders. They looked instead to their negotiated a
­ greements—
the [[treaties]] and the [[Manitoba]] agreement between the Provisional Government and [[Ottawa]]—that established a [[Canadian]] presence in the region.
[[Canada]]’s claim to have purchased the [[North]]-West can only be treated as
legitimate if it involved the transfer of legitimately controlled territory, a</p>

<p>situation that was not realizable on the ground. At the heart of this proposed
territorial transfer was the Company’s discovery claim, meaning that [[Canada]]’s claim to ownership, [[sovereignty]], and settler-colonial imperative in the
region is also initially premised on the same problematic justifications as
the Company’s. [[Canada]]’s purchase from the Company, which relies on the
assumption of legitimate Company ownership in [[1869]], suffers from a serious problem of credibility. This means that [[Canada]]’s claim to have purchased
the [[North]]-West—over half of [[Canada]]’s current land mass—is premised on a
legal fiction. Since the Company’s claim was itself founded on the fantasy
of discovery, [[Canada]] was in effect purchasing a fantastical claim to this
­already-peopled territory.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Beyond Discovery and Assertions of Sovereignty
It was only after a large-scale [[Canadian]] settler-colonial presence in the
[[North]]-West that these claims made sense. And it was not sound legal logic
that turned fantasy into common sense, but rather a large number of settlers
that believed in it. With this new [[Canadian]] ascendency, the fantasy could be
projected backward to found legitimate [[Canadian]] governance of the [[North]]West in the seventeenth-century fur [[trade]] forts of [[French]] [[trade]]rs.110 This
settler-colonial retrenchment of the fantasy of [[sovereignty]] began in earnest
in [[1870]], after the Métis Provisional Government’s rejection of [[Canadian]] authority in [[1869]]–70 resulted in the dispatch of a large military force of [[British]]
regulars and [[Canadian]] militia to Red River, effectively ending Métis political
independence there. While [[Indigenous]] communities remained in control of
their own lives for many years after, [[Indigenous]] governance over their territories was progressively restricted by the [[Canadian]] military and police units
that remained in the [[North]]-West after [[1870]]. It was only with this significant
military presence that a [[British]] entity could finally actualize the political
supremacy in the region originally imagined by Selkirk and Charles II. This
settler-colonial transition allowed what was once only a fantasy to be put
into practice.111 With widespread [[Canadian]] settlement—and the creation of
a permanent armed force in the [[North]]-West Mounted Police—settlers could
establish [[British]] and [[Canadian]] authority on a firm footing, and it was this
presence that made these old claims practicable.112
Thus, after [[1870]], [[Canada]] had the on-the-ground power necessary to then
trace its territorial ownership to [[1868]], to either the Charter or [[French]] discovery, and situate its [[sovereignty]] in the transfer agreement in [[1869]]–70. Only
after [[1870]] did these [[British]] claims make sense, because [[Canada]] was capable of enforcing the transfer agreement and its myriad claims of discovery
against the will of [[Indigenous]] peoples who rejected them.</p>

<p>However, from a perspective based on justice, settler and military control of a region does little to establish the legitimacy of a [[government]]. It is
in this sense that the series of events described above does not adequately
explain how [[Britain]], the Company, or [[Canada]] gained possession and political control over the [[North]]-West. Presuming that discovery underwrote [[British]] [[sovereignty]] and land title, the [[Crown]] and [[Canada]] consistently acted as if
they were already the sole lords and proprietors of a region controlled by [[Indigenous]] polities, and indeed this [[mental]]ity was what justified [[Canadian]] settlement and even military occupation on [[Indigenous]] lands. As this article has
shown, the origin of [[British]] and [[Canadian]] claims to ownership of the [[North]]West is premised on a fantasy of [[sovereignty]] developed through a narrative
that erases [[Indigenous]] political authority in theory without accounting for
its presence in fact. At no point before [[1870]] had [[Britain]] or [[Canada]] gained
the consent of [[Indigenous]] peoples to govern the territory, and the presence
of settlers and fur [[trade]]rs had been possible due to local agreements like the
Selkirk [[Treaty]] (and the numbered [[treaties]] after [[1870]]) rather than by abstract
claims of [[Europe]]an ownership.
Even though [[Canada]] is now capable of governing these territories, this
does not mean it began doing so in [[1668]]. Nor does it validate the transfer as
the origin of [[Western]] [[Canada]]’s place in Confederation. We must not confuse
the contemporary assertions of [[sovereignty]] arising from the fantasy of territorial purchase from the [[HBC]] as the basis for [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]] today. Instead, we must more carefully examine the on-the-ground relationships that
define [[British]]–[[Indigenous]] relations before [[1870]], which differed radically
from these high-level discourses on discovery and [[sovereignty]] that were impracticable and irrelevant to those living in the [[North]]-West. So, too, must we
revive international agreements, such as the Selkirk [[Treaty]] and the numbered [[treaties]] after it, which outline the specific ways [[Indigenous]] peoples envisioned [[Europe]]an presence on our lands. By doing so, we can move beyond
the fantastic claims of practically powerless interlopers who manufactured a
mythological authority that later was used to justify settler-­colonial possession of territory that ignored the existence of [[Indigenous]] political authority
throughout the [[North]]-West.</p>
