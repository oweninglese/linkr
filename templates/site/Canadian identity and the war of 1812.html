<p><code>Abstract
In [[2012]], the Harper [[government]] launched a national celebration of the bicentennial of
the [[War]] of [[1812]], even though few [[Canadian]]s were aware of the anniversary or of the
war itself. While commemorating a largely unknown war might at first seem counter
intuitive, this article argues that the focus on the [[War]] of [[1812]] represented an oppor
tunity to engage in the construction of a different [[Canadian]] identity. In effect, the
narrative surrounding the [[War]] of [[1812]] celebrations permitted the Conservative gov
ernment to begin to establish a new "[[warrior]] identity" in contrast to the "peacekeeping
identity" that has been associated with liberal internationalism and the Liberal Party.
While liberal internationalism in both the study and practice of [[Canadian]] foreign policy
contributed to a national identity framed around shared internationalist values, the
narratives presented during the [[War]] of [[1812]] celebrations suggest an alternative under
standing of the "true" nature of [[Canadian]] identity.</code></p>

<p><code>efforts of [[Canadian]]s then helped define who we are today, what side of the border we
live on, and which flag we salute.'</code></p>
<p><code>With these words, Prime Minister Stephen Harper began to establish the broad</code></p>
<h5>outlines of an emergent national identity, an identity expressed through</h5>
<p><code>[[Canada]]'s foreign policy and foreign wars—both "old" and new. Despite a cli
mate of fiscal austerity, budget cutting, and the downsizing of the federal public
service, the [[government]] of [[Canada]] chose to spend between approximately $
and $40 million2 during [[2012]] in commemoration of the bicentennial of the [[War]]
of [[1812]]. A special [[silver]] dollar coin, a new national monument on Parliament
Hill, funding for historical re-enactments, upgrades for historic sites, museum</code></p>
<h5>exhibits at the National [[War]] Museum, and even a mobile phone app were</h5>
<p>among the ways [[Canadian]] taxpayer dollars were mobilized to support the cele<br />
bration of the anniversary.3 Heritage Minister James Moore defended the deci<br />
sion to spend millions of dollars by pointing to the growth in popular interest in<br />
the [[War]] of [[1812]] since the [[government]] had launched its commemoration plans.<br />
"[[Canadian]]s are realizing that it is something that should be recognized across<br />
the country, not just in the regions where the [[battle]]s took place," he said.<br />
Moore went on to argue that even if people wanted to debate the wisdom of<br />
the [[government]]'s investment, "it's an essential role for [[government]] to remind<br />
[[Canadian]]s what unites us."<br />
For Moore, the commemoration of the [[War]] of [[1812]] was an exercise conceived<br />
in part to remind [[Canadian]]s of what and who they are as a people. The commem<br />
oration was justified, among other reasons, by the [[government]]'s perception of<br />
a lack of emphasis placed on the teaching of [[Canadian]] [[history]] in high schools.<br />
As a result, argued Minister Moore, "it falls upon all of us who have a passionate<br />
belief in [[Canadian]] [[history]], who have a deep feeling that we should be doing a better<br />
job of educating our [[kids]], to take advantage of moments like this [the bicentennial<br />
of the [[War]] of [[1812]]],"5 notwithstanding the fact that high school curricula are not<br />
under federal jurisdiction. Through the bicentennial celebrations, the [[Canadian]]<br />
[[government]] cast itself as [[history]] teacher, underlining the importance of "these<br />
historic moments" and of educating "our [[kids]] about the greatness that [[Canada]]</p>
<h5>has known, the struggles that we've seen, and the things that unite us</h5>

going forward."6 As if to confirm the necessity of this educative mission, a com<br />
prehensive survey conducted by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives Inc. for the<br />
Department of National Defence revealed that "few people who took part in the<br />
survey, and in related focus groups, were aware of the anniversary, and even fewer<br />
could identify the [[War]] of [[1812]] by name." The [[research]]ers went on to note that<br />
"typically, no more than one or two participants in each [focus] group were aware<br />
that this year is the bicentennial commemoration of the [[War]] of [[1812]], and these<br />
people tended to deduce this with simple arithmetic. From the year, [[1812]], they<br />
made the logical leap to the [[War]] of [[1812]]. Most focus group participants had no<br />
prior awareness of this anniversary."<br />
This article begins to unpack the ways in which the commemoration of the<br />
[[War]] of [[1812]] represents an exercise in identity reconstruction. The efforts of the<br />
Conservative [[government]] to rescue the war from the obscurity of being a<br />
"mostly forgotten war, except by the handful of professional historians on</p>
<h5>both sides of the [[Canada]]-US border, and the handfuls of people who live</h5>
<p><code>near [[battle]]grounds of yore"8 are worthy of some note.9 The war celebrated</code></p>
<h5>by the Harper [[government]] throughout [[2012]] as a "watershed moment" in</h5>
<p><code>[[Canadian]] [[history]] took place decades before [[Canada]] became a sovereign state,
empowered with the right to make its own policies, including its own foreign
policy. As Jeffrey Simpson has noted, the celebration of [[Canada]]'s military
prowess in this war ignores the fact that in [[1812]], "[t]here was no [[Canadian]]
army, although there were [[Canadian]] volunteers serving with the [[British]], for the
[[Canadian]] colonies were governed by the [[British]]." Further, the argument that
"by frustrating the [[America]]ns, [[Canada]] was saved as a sovereign nation" belies
the fact that "there was no such thing as a sovereign [[Canadian]] nation at the
time of the war."10 Finding the roots of what unites [[Canadian]]s from a time
when [[Canada]] did not exist as a sovereign state—much less a unified nation—
must be understood as a distinctly political strategy. If the Harper [[government]]
had wanted to celebrate an important event in [[Canadian]] [[history]] in the year
[[2012]], for whatever reasons of national unity or harmony, it had other choices:</code></p>
<h5>[[2012]] marked the 50th anniversary of the introduction of medicare in</h5>
<h5>[[Saskatchewan]], as well as the 30th anniversary of the [[Canadian]] Charter of</h5>

<p>choices to be medicare and the Charter."11 It had to be difficult to identify the<br />
[[War]] of [[1812]] as one of [[Canada]]'s enduring symbols when the vast majority of<br />
[[Canadian]]s were unaware of the war or why it might be important, both before<br />
and throughout the bicentennial celebrations.<br />
The choice of the [[War]] of [[1812]] as the historical milestone around which the</p>
<p>Harper [[government]] organized a series of events, activities, and testimonials, there<br />
fore, cannot be separated from its political agenda and its understanding of the<br />
world into which [[Canada]]'s foreign policy is projected. Neither medicare (the result<br />
of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)/[[New]] Democratic Party (NDP)<br />
policies) nor the Charter (brought into being by the federal Liberal Party) would<br />
respond to the exigencies of Conservative Party politics. The advantage of the [[War]]<br />
of [[1812]] as part of a new national narrative was that not only would it allow the<br />
[[government]] to begin to recast the place of the war (and of war more generally) in<br />
[[Canadian]] popular [[history]], it would do so in and against a particular context—that<br />
of [[Canadian]] internationalism—long identified with the Liberal Party of [[Canada]].<br />
As Kim Richard Nossal has argued, the overarching foreign policy orientation of<br />
the Harper [[government]] has been the belief in a Manichaean view of world politics,<br />
wherein the international scene is dominated by "a struggle between good and<br />
bad," and in such a black and [[white]] world, "the real defining moments for the<br />
country and for the world are those big conflicts where everything's at stake and<br />
where you take a side and show you can contribute to the right side."12 In addition,<br />
however, as Nossal has detailed, for the Harper [[government]], "the primary purpose<br />
of international policy is to advance a domestic partisan agenda."13 To state it<br />
more bluntly, foreign policy is also an instrument (among many others) that can be<br />
deployed to assure the destruction of the Liberal Party as the "natural governing<br />
party" of [[Canada]], and its replacement in that role by the Conservative Party. The<br />
celebration of the [[War]] of [[1812]] is consistent with these objectives not only because it<br />
casts [[Canada]] as a country "born out of conflict"14 that chose to fight for the<br />
"right" side and the "right" cause, but also because it creates the space in which<br />
it becomes possible to respond to and begin to reframe the identity markers fur<br />
nished for decades by the internationalism of Louis St. Laurent, Lester B. Pearson,<br />
and the Liberal Party of [[Canada]].<br />
If the framing of the [[War]] of [[1812]] was done in response to the tenets of liberal<br />
(and Liberal) internationalism, it is useful to return briefly to the meanings<br />
associated with it. While internationalism has been understood as a series of<br />
foreign policy practices (support for international institutions, multilateral pro<br />
cesses, and international law) giving middle power countries the potential to<br />
in[[flu]]ence great powers within multilateral structures, internationalism has</p>

<h5>also "promoted a sense of [[Canadian]] identity at the national and inter</h5>
<p><code>national levels."15 In this sense, the study of [[Canadian]] foreign policy is not
only about the policy practices of the [[Canadian]] [[government]]; it also asks ques
tions about how these practices contribute to defining the nature of [[Canada]]. In
its promotion of [[Canadian]] identity, two elements of liberal internationalism
stand out as critical: first, internationalism implies a conviction about the
higher calling to which [[Canadian]]s are held; its "purpose," in that sense, is to
provide a unifying common understanding of the virtues of [[Canada]] as an inter
national "brand" despite the complexities of [[Canadian]] diversity. As such, the
moral content of [[Canadian]] foreign policy (helpful fixer, good international citi
zen, peacekeeper, protector of the weak) is a powerful contributor to national
unity; if selflessness and altruism define who and what [[Canada]] is on the inter
national scene, they also affirm who and what [[Canadian]]s are at home. Second,
and directly related to the first, the moral content of liberal internationalism
projects a [[Canadian]] identity distinct from that of its southern neighbour, defining
a set of ways for [[Canadian]]s to assert (and to confirm) their distinctiveness from
the [[United]] [[States]].</code></p>
<p><code>The [[War]] of [[1812]] as a new discursive frame</code></p>
<p>The celebration of the bicentennial of the [[War]] of [[1812]] reframes [[Canadian]] identity<br />
in ways different from the frame provided by liberal (and Liberal) internationalism.<br />
Despite its differences, however, the [[1812]] reframing of the "true" nature of<br />
[[Canadian]] identity continues to respond to the two imperatives of the internation<br />
alist discourse outlined above: the construction of a unifying pan-[[Canadian]] iden<br />
tity that also asserts [[Canada]]'s distinctiveness from the [[United]] [[States]].<br />
Liberal internationalism as a discursive project is intimately linked to [[Canada]]'s<br />
role in the resolution of the Suez Crisis and the awarding of Lester B. Pearson's<br />
Nobel Peace Prize. The recasting of [[Canada]] from a peacekeeping nation to one<br />
"born out of conflict" is, in the Harper [[government]]'s framing, also tied to one<br />
event: this time, the [[War]] of [[1812]]. It is worthy of note that by articulating the [[War]]<br />
of [[1812]] as a national project before there was a nation, the Harper [[government]] is at<br />
least implicitly suggesting that a peace prize awarded in the [[1950]]s constitutes an<br />
aberration in the definition of [[Canada]]'s "authentic" national identity. It is not<br />
Nobel Peace Prizes that "define who we are as [[Canadian]]s," but rather the "vet<br />
erans who defended our land and ultimately won the fight for [[Canada]]."16 In this,<br />
the [[government]] of [[Canada]] is (arguably more subtly) reflecting the views of one of<br />
the most ardent defenders of [[Canada]]'s militaristic past, Jack Granatstein. In focus<br />
ing on the [[War]] of [[1812]], the Harper [[government]] is merely "highlighting something</p>

<p>everyone should know about anyway. There is a military past in [[Canada]], and it<br />
should be noted—not... hidden behind soft 'pacifist' views that have been perpe<br />
tuated by popular social [[history]] of the last 40 years."17 From this perspective, the<br />
legacy of the Pearson Nobel Peace Prize is to be found in the soft pacifist views that<br />
deny [[Canada]]'s true military identity—and the "truth" of that identity is enshrined<br />
in the date of its birth: [[1812]] rather than [[1956]].</p>
<h4>[[1812]] as a unifying moment</h4>
<p>The recasting of [[Canada]] as a military or [[warrior]] nation (rather than as a peace<br />
keeping one) does not merely rest on the ability of the [[government]] to reach further<br />
back into [[history]] than the peacekeeping narrative is able to go.18 Considerable</p>
<h5>efforts are deployed to create a discourse that unifies rather than divides</h5>
<p>[[Canadian]]s. Of particular note, the representations of the [[War]] of [[1812]] emphasize<br />
the participation of [[Canada]]'s First Nations, as well as of francophone [[Canadian]]<br />
soldiers, in the effort to vanquish the enemy. The war's commemorative symbols<br />
focus on this tripartite "[[Canadian]]" [[alliance]]. As an example, the special [[silver]] dollar<br />
coin produced by the [[Canadian]] Mint (selling for almost $60) depicts "a [[British]]<br />
sergeant, a Voltigeur Canadien and an Iroquois [[warrior]] wearing historically accur<br />
ate uniforms, approaching the invader with unity of purpose to defend the border<br />
and colonies they represent."19 The "major figures" deemed central to the war<br />
effort similarly highlight the contributions of [[Canadian]]s of anglophone, franco<br />
phone, and First Nations backgrounds.20 As the Government of [[Canada]]'s [[War]] of<br />
[[1812]] website reminds us, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, the "Hero of Upper<br />
[[Canada]]," was a member of the [[British]] Army. With the arrival of war in [[1812]],<br />
he initiated an aggressive campaign to protect Upper [[Canada]], even though his<br />
superiors had advised him to remain on the defensive. Tecumseh, a Shawnee<br />
chief and leader of a large tribal confederacy that opposed [[America]]n territorial<br />
expansion, joined Brock in the [[battle]] to capture Detroit on 16 [[August]] [[1812]]. For his<br />
part, Charles de Salaberry served as an officer of the [[British]] Army in Lower<br />
[[Canada]] (now [[Quebec]]). As war loomed in the spring of [[1812]], he helped raise a<br />
unit of militia corps, known as the [[Canadian]] Voltigeurs, from among his primarily</p>

The [[government]] of [[Canada]] is not content to reach back to [[1812]] to confirm [[Canada]]'s militaristic
roots. Extensive celebrations are planned for [[2017]] in remembrance of the [[1917]] Battle of Vimy
Ridge and the sacrifice of thousands of [[Canadian]] soldiers. As a precursor to these celebrations, the
new polymer $20 bill features the [[Canadian]] National Vimy Memorial located in northern [[France]],
rather than the artwork by First Nations artist Bill Reid, notably his sculptures Raven and the First
Men and Spirit of Haida Gwaii, as was the case with the "old" $20 bill.

<h5>Minister Harper has been systematic in underscoring the role of diverse</h5>
<p><code>[[Canadian]]s in the prosecution of the war. For example, in a speech given in the
[[Quebec]] community of Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix in [[September]] [[2012]], Harper
emphasized the importance of the contributions of francophone [[Canadian]]s to
the war effort: "One of those men was Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry. He bril
liantly led his troops, the Voltigeurs canadiens, at the Battle of Châteauguay. His
heroic victory made it possible to protect Montreal. His achievements made him
one of our most esteemed military leaders."22 In a ceremony held at Rideau Hall to
honour the contributions of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in the [[War]] of [[1812]], Harper con
tinued in this vein, this time highlighting the role of [[Canada]]'s First Nations:</code></p>
<h5>"During the [[War]] of [[1812]], First Nations and Métis [[warrior]]s stood shoulder</h5>
<p><code>to-shoulder with English and [[French]]-speaking militias and [[British]] military forces
to defend our country against [[America]]n invaders... Without their courage and
honour, [[Canada]] would not have been able to successfully defend itself and we
would not have the peaceful and prosperous country our citizens enjoy today."
The true point of Harper's testimonials became clear later in his speech honouring</code></p>

<p><code>It is another example of the in[[flu]]ence that the [[War]] of [[1812]] has had up to this very day
both on our [[history]] as a country and on our cultural heritage.</code></p>
<p><code>Friends, what makes this war so important is that [[French]] [[Canadian]]s, English,
[[Aboriginal]] peoples and many others, like freed [[slaves]], took up arms together to
achieve a common objective, to resist the [[America]]n invasion.</code></p>
<p><code>And the ties our ancestors forged laid the foundations of a truly pan-[[Canadian]] iden
tity and made our Confederation possible, a country of great cultural diversity with
two national languages.</code></p>
<p><code>Let us always remember that this country, [[Canada]], exists only because of diverse
peoples, English-speaking, [[French]]-speaking, [[Aboriginal]], and others, who came
together in [[1812]] to resist the [[America]]n invasion and to defend their unique identities
and our shared territory.</code></p>
<p>The [[War]] of [[1812]] assumes an almost mythical status in this retelling, for it becomes<br />
a moment in which a "true" [[Canadian]] national identity is forged. In contrast to<br />
[[Canadian]] internationalism, where a pan-[[Canadian]] identity is constructed through<br />
an attachment to specific political values (however exaggerated), this new [[Canadian]]<br />
identity is born of political necessity. [[Canada]]'s identity stems from the commitment<br />
of its peoples—especially English, [[French]], and First Nations—to defending<br />
[[Canada]] from [[America]]n invasion. [[Canada]], as the former minister of national<br />
defence Peter MacKay would have it, was thus "born out of conflict" rather<br />
than out of legislative gradualism. In this narrative, [[Canada]] was forged in the<br />
crucible of war, in which all of its founding peoples played a key role. Of course,<br />
these claims of collaboration between all of [[Canada]]'s peoples gloss over how many<br />
residents of what would become [[Ontario]] would have been happier fighting for the<br />
[[America]]ns (and providing them aid and comfort when they could). Similarly, in the<br />
[[United]] [[States]], there were clear divisions between Republicans and Federalists over<br />
the wisdom of the war. Historian Alan Taylor's much-respected [[2010]] book, The<br />
Civil [[War]] of [[1812]], suggests the extent to which representations of the war as a<br />
[[battle]] between two nations is overstated to the point of misrepresentation.<br />
More importantly, the [[1812]] portrait of a unified [[Canada]] is not developed<br />
around the values of peacekeeping or good international citizenship; it is not<br />
[[Canada]]—the honest broker. It is [[Canada]] the [[warrior]] nation, with all of its peoples<br />
participating in that [[warrior]] inclination. Individual differences between [[Canadian]]s<br />
based on their language or ethnic group are largely irrelevant in this [[warrior]] nation.</p>

For Harper, this point is particularly clear, as he revealed in his [[Canada]] Day [[2012]]<br />
speech:<br />
Almost exactly two centuries ago, an [[America]]n invasion of [[Canada]] was launched.<br />
Our ancestors, English, [[French]], [[Aboriginal]], people of all backgrounds, joined in the<br />
fight for [[Canada]].<br />
It was during the [[War]] of [[1812]]—the [[battle]] for [[Canada]]—that the very foundations of<br />
this great country of ours were laid.<br />
A country born in [[French]], a country proud of its cultural diversity, stability and<br />
prosperity, a country, [[Canada]], that stands apart in [[North]] [[America]].<br />
In fighting together, our ancestors in [[1812]] laid the basis for a common sense of<br />
[[Canadian]] nationality based on diversity.<br />
And they laid the basis for the vision of freedom, democracy and justice that is our<br />
inheritance, [[Canada]], the best country in the world.<br />
The [[War]] of [[1812]] gives birth to a common sense of [[Canadian]] nationality based on<br />
diversity. Difference is not itself important, although what differences exist—within<br />
[[Canada]] and between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]—were the results of the [[War]] of<br />
[[1812]]: "Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[French]] fact in [[North]] [[America]] would not be<br />
protected here in [[Canada]]. Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[Aboriginal]] fact would not<br />
be protected. Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], [[Canada]] would not have been established in<br />
[[1867]]."27 [[Canadian]] identity is thus entrenched (and defined) in a particular under<br />
standing of the source of the [[Canadian]] values that Harper outlines. His under<br />
standing of the source of these values is made clear in a speech given at the Chief of<br />
Defence Staff Change of Command ceremony on 29 [[October]] [[2012]]. While one<br />
might expect that the speech would herald the many contributions of General<br />
Natynchzyk during his four years as chief of the defence staff, it in fact begins<br />
by painting a picture of [[Canada]] that finds its origins in the [[War]] of [[1812]]. Speaking<br />
about the [[Canadian]] military as an institution, Harper points out that:<br />
Two hundred years ago this year, the first roots of this institution took hold when<br />
[[Canadian]]s of diverse backgrounds risked, and in many cases, lost their lives in the war<br />
that firmly established our existence as a separate country.</p>

<p><code>And in every generation since the [[War]] of [[1812]], a special group of citizens, men and
women, have put on the uniform and put themselves in harm's way, so that their
fellow [[Canadian]]s need not.</code></p>
<p><code>It is the institution of the military, the institution through which different
[[Canadian]]s in all their diversity have participated, and the war waged by the mili
tary, which has constructed the nation. As the prime minister reminds us on the
[[1812]] website, "[t]he [[War]] was instru[[mental]] in creating [[Canada]]'s armed forces.
Many of our current reserve regiments in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[Atlantic]] [[Canada]]
trace their origins back to this time. It was the beginning of a long and proud
military [[history]] in [[Canada]]."29 We are not peacekeepers, we are [[warrior]]s. This is
not the [[Canada]] of the Nobel Peace Prize, this is the [[Canada]] of bumper stickers
reading "[[War]] of [[1812]]: Been There, Won That."
The unifying nature of this new narrative of [[Canadian]] identity is thus a function
of "everyone" having participated in the war. The loyalty to a coherent and unified
[[Canada]] despite our diversity stems from the loyalty owed to those who ostensibly
fought to protect it between [[1812]] and [[1815]]. Just as the [[death]]s of [[Canadian]] soldiers
in Afghanistan were often mobilized to legitimize [[Canada]]'s continued participation
in the war (to withdraw would have betrayed their sacrifice), so too, the fact that
"[[Canada]]'s diverse peoples" repulsed the [[America]]n invasion, with many dying in
the effort, is more than enough to construct a unified [[Canada]] two hundred years
later. As Minister Moore has been fond of saying, it is "[t]hese heroic efforts" that
"tell the story of today's [[Canada]]."</code></p>
<p><code>[[1812]] and the birth of a distinct [[Canada]]</code></p>
<p>If the [[War]] of [[1812]] constructs [[Canada]] as unified by the very fact of [[Canadian]]<br />
participation in the war, how does the [[1812]] narrative construct [[Canada]] as distinct,<br />
notably from the [[United]] [[States]]? At first, the answer seems self-evident. [[Canadian]]s<br />
are not [[America]]ns because [[Canadian]]s "won" the [[War]] of [[1812]]. The war defined, in<br />
Stephen Harper's words, "what side of the border we live on, and which flag we<br />
salute." [[Canada]] stood up to the [[America]]n invasion. As Minister Moore put it in<br />
[[June]] [[2012]], "As [[Canadian]]s, we are used to thinking of our neighbours to the south<br />
as friends and allies. But, 200 years ago, [[America]]n troops stormed our borders.</p>

Thomas Jefferson said the [[America]]n invasion would be 'a mere matter of<br />
marching'... The [[War]] of [[1812]] was the fight for [[Canada]]."32 The pride at having<br />
proven Jefferson wrong (and the pleasure of quoting his erroneous assessment<br />
some 200 years later) is evident. Whereas the narrative of internationalism con<br />
structed [[Canada]]'s distinctiveness on the basis of its "middle power" values, the<br />
[[1812]] narrative posits that [[Canada]]'s distinctiveness rests on having defeated the<br />
[[United]] [[States]] in the "fight for [[Canada]]": "The [[War]] of [[1812]]... defined our terri<br />
torial integrity, defined us differently from the [[United]] [[States]] and was instru[[mental]]<br />
in the creation of our country,"33 Moore explains. The [[1812]] narrative constructs a<br />
unified [[Canada]] because all of [[Canada]]'s diverse people fought in the war, and a<br />
distinct [[Canada]] because "we won." The space for political discussion around<br />
values is limited, because the [[War]] of [[1812]] establishes the facts.<br />
The Harper [[government]] does not rest here in deploying the [[1812]] narrative. The<br />
war is also constructed as the catalyst for peace. In the words of the prime minister<br />
himself, "The signing of the [[Treaty]] of Ghent and other [[treaties]] that followed<br />
confirmed the border between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]—now the world's<br />
longest, undefended border and an example of nations coexisting peacefully side by<br />
side with mutual respect and friendship."34 [[War]] is an instrument that brings sus<br />
tainable peace, and the implication is clear. Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], [[Canada]]'s<br />
relations with the [[United]] [[States]] might well be fraught with tensions and challenges.<br />
The [[War]] of [[1812]] resolved all of that.</p>
<h5>Finally, [[Canada]] is also distinct from the [[United]] [[States]] because [[Canada]] is</h5>
<p><code>[[British]]. The [[Canada]] of today, born of the [[War]] of [[1812]], is "an independent and
free country in a constitutional monarchy with its own [[parliament]]ary system."35 The
attachment to the [[Crown]], while subtle, marks the [[1812]] narrative and the symbols
supporting it. Graphical representations of the major figures of the war reproduce
their [[British]] military uniforms. The Union Jack is foregrounded, always flying
high. When Prime Minister Harper met with First Nations leaders at Rideau
Hall to thank them for their contributions to the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[Crown]] was
omnipresent in his remarks:</code></p>
<p><code>All those years ago at the conclusion of the [[War]] of [[1812]], and in recognition of their
valour, [[Aboriginal]] communities were presented with military banners and [[King]]
George the Third medals. So it will be today.</code></p>

<p><code>[[1812]] Commemorative Medals. Both Banner and Medal reflect the strong connection

<p><code>The medal design has a likeness of Her Majesty The [[Queen]] on one side, and the image

design of the medal itself were approved by Buckingham Palace. They are bestowed

<p>There is an attachment to a notion of benevolent queen and country which tra<br />
verses Harper's [[1812]] speeches, nowhere more clearly than in his assertion that "the<br />
[[War]] helped establish our path toward becoming an independent and free country,<br />
united under the [[Crown]] with a respect for linguistic and ethnic diversity."37 The<br />
continued diversity of [[Canadian]]s, made possible by the outcome of the [[War]] of<br />
[[1812]], is a diversity that is articulated within a specific—[[British]]—context. If the<br />
narrative of internationalism—of a compassionate [[Canada]] engaged with the<br />
world—was mirrored domestically by the ethos of [[multiculturalism]], the narrative<br />
of [[1812]] has no such pretenses. Multiculturalism is replaced by an explicit attach<br />
ment to the [[British]] [[Crown]]. Adding the prefix "Royal" to the [[Canadian]] Navy and<br />
Air Force, as Harper did in [[2011]], is only one manifestation of this narrative.38 The<br />
[[Canadian]] military, which forged the nation, is a Royal one.</p>
<p>Conclusion: The [[battle]] of the narratives</p>
<p>If the narrative of [[1812]] has tried to recast [[Canadian]] unity and distinctiveness along<br />
new lines, we must ask about the impacts of such a discursive manoeuvre.39 As I</p>
<p><code>National Post Staff, "'Key to the victory': Stephen Harper honours First Nations contribution to

to-the-victory-stephen-harper-honours-first-nations-contribution-to-war-of-[[1812]]/ (accessed 3
[[April]] [[2013]]). Nowhere in his speech does Harper allude to the very complicated, and often con
frontational, relationship between First Nations peoples and the [[Crown]]. For First Nations peoples
throughout [[North]] [[America]], the [[War]] of [[1812]] was far more a "desperate struggle for freedom and
independence" and a fight "to defend their homelands" than a question of choosing sides—and
certainly not of lining up with the [[British]] to defend [[Canada]] from [[America]]n invasion. See "Four

It is important to note that the campaign to celebrate the bicentennial of the [[War]] of [[1812]] was
almost certainly not successful in teaching [[Canadian]]s about the war or its importance. As the
report by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives (cited at the outset of this article) discussed, even during
the height of the [[1812]] celebrations, "the relevance of commemorating the event seemed lost on
almost all" ([[Canadian]] Press, "Few [[Canadian]]s aware"). Nonetheless, the extent to which
[[Canadian]]s learned, or indeed, cared, about the [[War]] of [[1812]], despite the expenditures of millions
of dollars, is in some respect beside the point. The messages about [[Canada]] that the Harper gov
ernment associated with the celebration of the [[War]] of [[1812]]—messages that appear in other cam
paigns in other contexts—transcend the specifics of this one effort at commemoration.</code></p>

have argued elsewhere, understood as part of the process of constructing and<br />
reinforcing a specific [[Canadian]] identity, the use of the internationalist narrative<br />
has not been without its consequences.40 If [[Canada]] is unusually virtuous and moral<br />
on the world stage, this necessarily implies that others are not quite as virtuous or<br />
possessing of the same moral superiority. A claim of being a uniquely virtuous or<br />
moral nation both casts [[Canadian]] domestic politics as uniquely harmonious and<br />
egalitarian (for such a virtuous moral posture internationally surely must be the<br />
result of a uniquely moral society domestically) and projects an imperial project<br />
abroad: in constructing [[Canada]] as noble, virtuous, and laudable, foreign "others"<br />
are necessarily constructed as less noble and virtuous.<br />
The [[1812]] narrative also clearly seeks to project [[Canadian]] authority internation<br />
ally by casting [[Canada]] as a prudent but potentially belligerent country. As Harper<br />
has made clear, [[Canadian]] foreign policy would not reflect the "soft pacifist" views<br />
associated by Conservative supporters with Liberal internationalism. No longer<br />
would the purpose of [[Canada]]'s foreign policy be "just to go along and get along<br />
with everyone else's agenda. It is no longer to please every dictator with a vote at<br />
the [[United]] Nations."41 Far from the helpful fixer posture associated with peace<br />
keeping, [[Canada]] would not seek to mediate a resolution to conflicts, but would<br />
rather choose sides wisely and be prepared to fight.<br />
The [[1812]] narrative also acts to cast [[Canada]]'s domestic sphere in a more com<br />
bative light. The [[War]] of [[1812]] defines [[Canada]] in the context of a political project,<br />
but one that is exclusionary as much as it is inclusionary (both rhetorically and in<br />
practice)—for it is the project of Empire. While Harper's speeches remind us of the<br />
participation of the [[French]] and the First Nations in prosecuting the [[War]] of [[1812]],<br />
they are integrated as subjects of the [[Crown]], rather than as actors in their own<br />
right, with their own claims against the [[America]]ns. While the rhetoric of inter<br />
nationalism conceals an imperialism which is outwardly directed (if [[Canadian]]s are<br />
morally superior, that moral superiority is exercised with respect to someone), the<br />
new rhetoric of [[1812]] constructs an imperialism which is both powerfully internal<br />
(one nation under the [[British]] [[Crown]]) and external ([[Canadian]]s are right to fight<br />
wars because [[Canada]] was "born out of conflict" and [[Canada]]'s glory was and is<br />
proven through war).<br />
This new rhetoric is also powerfully gendered, because war—and certainly the<br />
[[War]] of [[1812]]—is man's work. The willingness to fight, to prove oneself superior to<br />
the [[America]]n invaders, the glory of the ultimate sacrifice—the ideal [[Canadian]] in<br />
the service of the nation—is constructed along a model of militarized masculinity.<br />
Women are nearly invisible in this new narrative, despite the efforts of the Harper<br />
[[government]] to appear inclusive. That effort is focused first on the figure of Laura<br />
Secord, who fulfils the role in the [[1812]] narrative of "standing in" for all women</p>

<p><code>and of allowing the Harper [[government]] to claim that the [[1812]] discourse is inclusive
of everyone. The "official" story of Laura Secord is worthy of a close look:</code></p>
<p><code>Laura Secord's adventures started when her husband, James Secord, a sergeant in the
1st Lincoln militia, was wounded early on in the [[War]] of [[1812]]. She managed to rescue
him from the [[battle]]field during the [[battle]] of [[Queen]]ston Heights...</code></p>
<p><code>In [[June]] of [[1813]], [[Queen]]ston was still occupied by [[America]]n troops when James and
Laura Secord were forced to host some [[America]]n officers in their home. That's when
she overheard the [[America]]ns plan to surprise the [[British]] outpost at Beaver Dams and
capture the officer in charge, Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. Her husband, given his
injuries, was unable to deliver this message to the [[British]] so she set out to do it herself.
The direct route to the outpost was 12 miles (about 20 kilometres), and Laura was
worried that she would encounter [[America]]n guards on her way there. She decided it
would be better to travel through fields and forests; it wasn't easy and when she finally
arrived, she was exhausted.</code></p>
<p><code>After she crossed the Twelve Mile [[Cree]]k on a fallen tree, Laura was surprised to come
upon a First Nations' encampment. Once her mission was explained, the chief took
her directly to FitzGibbon. Two days later, [[America]]n troops were ambushed near
Beaver Dams by First Nations [[warrior]]s. FitzGibbon then persuaded the much larger
[[America]]n forces to surrender.</code></p>
<h5>In this [[War]] of [[1812]] biography, Laura Secord is the perfect—and per</h5>
<p><code>fectly—militarized wife. She is an admirable helpmate to her soldier husband,
arguably going beyond the call of duty in rescuing him from the [[battle]]field. She
cares for him and tends to his injuries. Once she overhears the plans of the
[[America]]n soldiers, she decides she must warn the [[British]], but only because her
husband cannot do so as a result of his wounds. She is the Rosie the Riveter of the
[[War]] of [[1812]]—assuming a temporary duty because her husband cannot. The hier
archy of love—for god, country, and home—is revealed, as she sets out on a dan
gerous mission because loyalty to the ([[British]]) state is a higher calling, more
important that her own safety or that of her wounded husband.
Laura Secord is one of only two women given preeminence in the [[1812]] narrative,
although the one woman deemed to be a major figure. The second woman featured
in the Harper [[government]]'s recounting of the war is Mary Henry, and her role is

where Henry's husband, a retired artillery gunner, was the keeper. Throughout the<br />
landing and the extremely heavy [[bomb]]ardment, casualties were numerous with half<br />
the [[British]] and [[Canadian]]s [[kill]]ed or wounded. During this entire action, Mary<br />
Henry walked the [[battle]]field, bringing coffee and food to the troops and tending<br />
to the wounded, as though "guarded by some unseen angel from the peril which<br />
menaced her every step."44 Mary Henry is the ultimate nurse, bringing food and<br />
comfort to the troops. Her role, while celebrated, is supportive—of the men in<br />
[[battle]], and of the state which wages war. Neither Mary Henry nor Laura Secord<br />
raise questions about state policy nor do they advocate solutions other than war.<br />
The near invisibility of women, their silent support for a nation at war, their<br />
selfless support of the men (and the state) that prosecute the war—these gender<br />
roles are replicated in the controversy surrounding the unveiling of the design<br />
finalists for the [[War]] of [[1812]] memorial which will find pride of place as a permanent<br />
fixture on Parliament Hill. The terms of reference for the design of the memorial<br />
required that the proposals represent seven distinct groups: the [[British]] Army, the<br />
[[British]] Navy, the Provincial Marine, the English-speaking militia, the [[French]]<br />
speaking militia, First Nations, and Métis.45 Of the two shortlisted statues, only<br />
one displays a woman—caring for a wounded soldier in the background.46 If war<br />
confirms the glory of the nation, women are not central to that project. The nar<br />
rative of [[1812]] confirms that foreign policy is man's work.<br />
Whereas the rhetoric of internationalism depoliticizes [[Canada]]'s wars (by con<br />
structing them as peacekeeping or the work of the good international citizen—and<br />
therefore always right), the rhetoric of [[1812]] gives pride of place to [[Canada]]'s mili<br />
tary and a particular Manichaean understanding of world politics. This under</p>
<h5>standing tries to reframe the way in which two basic elements of the</h5>
<p><code>internationalist discourse functions: [[Canadian]]s are unified (because we participated
in our diversity in the war under the [[British]] [[Crown]], which is our real heritage) and
we are distinct from the [[United]] [[States]] (because we won, and because we are</code></p>
<h5>[[British]]). Declaring the military to be a "Royal" institution and ordering</h5>
<p>[[Canadian]] embassies, high commissions, and consulates abroad to display pictures<br />
of the [[Queen]]47 reaffirm this understanding of the world and [[Canada]]'s place within</p>

reported that "the inclusion of a woman" will likely be one of the changes to the design that will
result from the final design process in consultation with the federal [[government]]. See Elizabeth
