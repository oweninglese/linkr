<p><a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.files.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/08/salon-14-thumb.jpg" title="link">image 1: salon-14-thumb (link #2)</a>It’s festival season in Darwin again. 
Gallerists Matt [[War]]d (Outstation Gallery) and Paul Johnstone (Paul Johnstone 
Gallery, formerly known as CCAE) have brought back the Salon des Refusés for a 
second season. What could be more festive?</p>
<p>Reacting last year to the reduced size of the final hang for the National 
[[Aboriginal]] and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, [[War]]d and Johnstone elected to 
invite those who didn’t make the cut at NATSIAA to participate in their 
alternative celebration. The result was a sprightly collection of familiar 
masterpieces and intriguing new work, a total of 40 canvases, sculpture, and 
works on paper.</p>
<p>For the 2[[014]] edition of the Salon, [[War]]d and Johnstone have increased their won 
hang by over 50%, with 64 works included the time. Seven bark paintings extend 
the scope of the selection as well, a welcome addition to the show’s diversity. 
All in all (although I obviously haven’t seen the roster of the NATSIAA at the 
time of this writing), the Salon looks to be a fair challenge, almost equal in 
size to the canonical show, and certain to be its equal in quality.</p>

<p>As is true of the NATSIAA, some artists are making an encore appearance. 
Repeaters from the first Salon this year include Sandy Brumby, Roy Burnyila, 
Nyarapayi Giles, Ishmael Marika, Yukultji Napangati, Eve Nargoodah, Rosie 
Tasman, and the Spinifex Women with another collaborative canvas. Last year’s 
overall winners at the NATSIAA, Jenni Kemarre Martinello, is represented in the 
Salon this time with another blown-glass work, an eel trap that brings to mind 
the seminal weaving work of Yvonne Koolmatrie. Among those revisiting the Salon,
Sandy Brumby’s rough “Victory Downs” is one of the strongest works I’ve seen 
from this artist; and Roy Burnyila’s “Freshwater Story” is packed with energy. 
The ever-inventive Ishmael Marika scores a hit with his spooky but humorous 
digital photographic print “Galka with the Artworks.” A galka is a “dark heart 
person” and this particular one, with eyes straight out of “Children of the 
Damned,” has found his way into heart of the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre and 
stands, wearing a bright red “Gove NT” t-shirt, amidst a forest of larrakitj 
ready for sale.</p>
<p>As always, I have my favorites among the entries. Perhaps the stand-out for me 
is Mark Nodea’s “Lost Souls,” a stunning work from this [[War]]mun artist in black, 
brown and bluish-gray ochres that recalls some of Rover Thomas’s masterpieces, 
infused in spirit with a bit of Dante’s Inferno, and executed with washes of 
great delicacy. I’ve always been impressed with Nodea’s command of color within 
a restricted palette, but he’s quite outdone himself this time. It’s terrestrial
and celestial at the same time.</p>

<p>Nancy McDinny’s [[history]] painting, “[[War]] at Blackfella Spring,” is a tour-de-force
of allover composition whose clever use of color is an outstanding achievement. 
The painting depicts the incursion of dozens of policemen into a camp in the 
bush of the Barkley Tableland. In the foreground a few [[white]] humpies grouped 
around fire testify to the presence of blackfellas and are balanced in the 
composition by a screen of [[white]] clouds that stretches across the top edge of 
the canvas. In between, amidst the variegated greens of the forest land, 
blue-jacketed policemen spread out in search of the blackfellas. The policemen’s
[[white]] hats create a visual bridge between the humpies and the clouds; scattered 
amongst them tiny [[white]] dots show the presence of blackfellas hidden in the 
bush, ready to defend their country against the invaders’ incursion.</p>
<p>Color is key to Jayaku Biljabu’s “Wikirri” from Martumili Artists. Color also 
provides the strength in the design of “[[War]]lutu” by Tjarlili Art’s Bob Gibson, 
with intense red, [[white]], and blue swirling in the shape representing Lake 
Hopkins in [[Western]] [[Australia]]. Another strong work from Tjarlili in reds and 
blues is Valmayi Nampitjinpa’s “Karrkurunkintja,” a retelling of the wati 
kutjara and liru kutjara (two men and two snakes) story from the Kintore region.
Tommy [[May]] uses a similar palette to quite different effect in his depiction of 
the “Seven Sisters” story from Wangkajungka country, courtesy of Mangkaja Arts; 
the composition in some ways recalls Lisa Uhl’s paintings of trees from a 
different country. And perhaps proving that the desert is indeed a country for 
old men, strong works from Harry Tjutjuna, Johnny Yungut Tjupurrula, and Roy 
Underwood bring a muscular strength to the painting section of the Salon.</p>
<p>In the category of works on paper, Injalak Arts is well represented by two 
members of Waud Namok’s family. Grandson Maath Maralngurra’s “Lambalk” ([[sugar]] 
glider) is full of grace and movement, while granddaughter Lorraine Kabbindi 
White’s “Guardians” is full of female water spirits swirling above a 
lily-encrested Rainbow Serpent. The old man has surely left his tradition is 
good hands. From Yirrkala, Munuy’ngu Marika, one of the stars of the Yuta (new) 
screeprint collection that debuted at Garma in [[2010]], has contributed a charming 
new work, “Dhapirrk Girri,” a self-portrait in a flowing pink-and-green flowered
print skirt on the beach near her home.</p>
<p>The passing on of traditions finds a place in the barks section as well, with 
Antonia Pascoe contributing her version of “Fresh Water Mussels” (ngangi), a 
motif developed in Maningrida a decade ago by her father, Michael Gadjawala. 
Similarly, Fiona [[Mason]] carries on in the tradition of Tommy Gondorra Steele with
a lovely and delicate rendering of the “Jima Jima (Waterlily)” motif.</p>
<p>And finally in the 3-D category comes the other work along with Nodea’s painting
that thrills me deeply. Andrew Lunguy, from Mardbalk Arts and Culture on 
Goulburn Island, has contributed a sculpture</p>
<p><a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.files.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/08/salon-lunguy.jpg" title="link">image 4: Andrew Lunguy, "Marlajak (Freshwater Prawn)," blackwattle carving,

x 7 cm</p>
<p>executed in carved blackwattle wood, that is simply breathtaking. The delicacy 
of the creature’s limbs, eyestalks, and feelers conveys a visceral sense of 
their movement, swaying in its watery habitat; the rounded bulk of its body, 
with marks of the workman’s rasp clearly visible, gleams with a polished light 
that seems the very refraction of light on the water. Not quite two feet long 
from its tip to its tail, it fairly delights the eye with grace and vigor.</p>
<p>Once again, my hat is off to [[War]]d and Johnstone for bringing together this 
extraordinary show. But I would be remiss not to mention Nicole Vandersteegen of
Niva Design, who has produced the catalogue for this year’s exhibition. It’s a 
work of stunning design that enhances the beauty of the artworks themselves and 
provides (in PDF format) easy navigation through the selections. All around, the
Salon des Refusés once more proves itself to be a class act, and I am sure that 
it will be a major draw during the Darwin Festival. The Salon will be showing 
9-24 [[August]] on the Stokes Hill Wharf; don’t miss it when you’re in town.</p>
