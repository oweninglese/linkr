<h2>REALIZING INdIGENOuS RIGHTS IN INTE[[RNA]]TIONAL ENvIRONmENTAL LAW: A CANAdIAN PERSPECTIvE</h2>
<h3>RISA SCHWARTZ • 1</h3>
<p>The [[Crown]] has a duty to consult [[Aboriginal]] peoples when<br />
it has either real or constructive knowledge of an [[Aboriginal]]<br />
right and title and is contemplating action that might affect<br />
either the right or title. To date, the majority of [[Canadian]]<br />
[[Aboriginal]] case law has focused on applying the duty to<br />
consult to statutory decisions that could interfere with<br />
domestic [[Aboriginal]] or [[treaty]] rights. [[Aboriginal]] peoples<br />
have an opportunity to transform international decision<br />
making if [[Canada]] determines there is a legal requirement to<br />
include [[indigenous]] voices when negotiating and ratifying<br />
international agreements, especially those pertaining to<br />
the environment.</p>
<p>Formal legal consultation with [[indigenous]] peoples on a<br />
country’s international negotiating position for agreements<br />
that have the potential to impact [[indigenous]] rights will be<br />
a significant governance and policy shift. Even though<br />
the Federal Court of Appeal in <em>Hupacasath First Nation v<br />
[[Canada]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs)</em> rejected consultation<br />
requirements for the ratification of an international<br />
investment [[treaty]], the negotiation of environ[[mental]]<br />
agreements has much clearer links to [[Aboriginal]] rights. As<br />
well, the [[Canadian]] [[government]]’s promise to implement<br />
the [[United]] Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]]<br />
Peoples (UNDRIP) also has the potential to in[[flu]]ence future<br />
court decisions. This proposed legal change is not without<br />
challenges. Given that there are more than 600 recognized<br />
First Nations bands in [[Canada]] and many non-status and<br />
urban [[indigenous]] populations, as well as Metis and Inuit<br />
peoples, a workable solution for legal consultation for<br />
legislation and other administrative matters should be a<br />
focus of [[indigenous]] political organizations as they prepare<br />
for the implementation of UNDRIP in [[Canada]].</p>
<p>[[Indigenous]] peoples have faced challenges participating<br />
in the negotiation and development of international law<br />
agreements, which has been demonstrated in [[Canada]] in<br />
a recent claim, brought by the Hupacasath First Nation<br />
(HFN). The HFN was attempting to push the consultation<br />
envelope as the First Nation sought to provide [[indigenous]]<br />
peoples in [[Canada]] with the ability to shape international<br />
policy on matters that may impact their rights. <em>Hupacasath<br />
First Nation v [[Canada]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs)</em> was the<br />
first case in [[Canada]] where a court was asked to determine<br />
whether there was a constitutional obligation to consult<br />
prior to ratification of an international investment [[treaty]].^1<br />
The Federal Court of Appeal determined that there is no<br />
duty on the [[government]] to consult a particular First Nations<br />
community prior to the ratification of an international<br />
investment [[treaty]] that [[Canada]] had negotiated with [[China]],<br />
as the potential adverse impacts on [[Aboriginal]] rights was</p>
<p>1 [[2013]] FC 900, [2[[014]]] 4 FCR 836, [[[2013]]] FCJ No 927 (FC) [ <em>Hupacasath FC</em> ].</p>
<p><code>deemed speculative. This decision can be seen as a narrow
precedent, as it only concerns one international agreement
and the potential impacts of this agreement on the rights of
a particular First Nations community. Hupacasath FC was
a difficult test case to expand consultation rights, given
the uncertainties of linking impacts from future unknown
foreign investments to adverse impacts to the specific
[[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights of a particular First Nation.</code></p>
<p><code>While the impacts of an international investment
agreement may be determined speculative by a [[Canadian]]
court, a stronger precedent-setting case may involve
challenging the lack of consultation when [[Canada]]
negotiates environ[[mental]] agreements, such as those
regarding [[climate]] change, where a lack of negotiated
stringent targets has the potential to impact the ability to
hunt, fish and gather, activities that are clearly protected
in the many [[treaties]] that blanket [[Canada]]. As well, formal
consultation with [[indigenous]] peoples prior to acceding
to biodiversity protocols, which aim to provide a process
for access to and benefit sharing of traditional knowledge,
would seem to be a prudent [[government]] action. Unlike
the court’s decision in Hupacasath FC , a future court may
not be able to easily dismiss a claim that consultation was
owed prior to the accession to or ratification of agreements
such as the Paris Agreement on [[climate]] change or the
Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity,
as there are clearer causal connections between these
international environ[[mental]] agreements and [[Aboriginal]]
rights and interests. Governments, such as [[Canada]],
that are considering the policy and legal implications
of implementing UNDRIP^2 should be informed on
the breadth of the declaration’s potential impacts for
international decision making. UNDRIP implementation
would build a stronger case that [[indigenous]] participation
in the development of international agreements may be
required, both in [[Canada]], through its unique constitutional
requirements, and internationally.</code></p>
<p><code>The relationship between the [[Crown]] (federal and provincial
[[government]]s of [[Canada]]) and [[Aboriginal]]^3 peoples has
rapidly changed over the past decade, due in part to the
decision of the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] (SCC) in Haida
Nation ,^4 which applied the constitutional protections set</code></p>

<p><code>3 This paper uses the term “[[Aboriginal]]” when discussing rights in

and Metis peoples of [[Canada]].

<h2>CIGI PAPERS NO. 109 — OCTOBER [[2016]]</h2>
<p>2 • CENTRE FOR INTE[[RNA]]TIONAL GOvE[[RNA]]NCE INNOvATION</p>
<p>out in section 35 of [[Canada]]’s Constitution^5 in a procedural<br />
duty to consult. The duty to consult is triggered “when the<br />
[[Crown]] has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential<br />
existence of an [[Aboriginal]] right or title and contemplates<br />
conduct that might adversely affect it.”^6 In <em>Haida Nation</em> ,<br />
the SCC clarified that the source of “the [[government]]’s<br />
duty to consult with [[Aboriginal]] peoples and accommodate<br />
their interests is grounded in the honour of the [[Crown]]. The<br />
honour of the [[Crown]] is always at stake in its dealings with<br />
[[Aboriginal]] peoples.”^7 Known as a three-part test, the duty<br />
is applied when the following are present:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is knowledge by the [[Crown]] of an established or<br />
  asserted [[Aboriginal]] or [[treaty]] right;</li>
<li>[[Crown]] conduct is contemplated; and</li>
<li>there is the potential for an adverse effect of the<br />
  proposed [[Crown]] conduct on an established or<br />
  asserted [[Aboriginal]] or [[treaty]] right.</li>
</ul>
<p>The majority of [[Canadian]] [[Aboriginal]] case law has focused<br />
on applying the duty to consult to statutory decisions<br />
that could interfere with [[Aboriginal]] and/or [[treaty]] rights.<br />
Examples of statutory decisions that have been examined<br />
by the courts for adequacy of consultation include the<br />
issuance of approvals for mineral, oil and gas extraction or<br />
forest management undertakings. There is still debate over<br />
whether the duty extends more broadly to law making.<br />
Although the SCC has not yet ruled on whether the duty<br />
to consult applies to legislation, there is a lower court<br />
decision that recognized that the duty can be triggered<br />
by the introduction of a bill into Parliament, such as<br />
introduction of an omnibus bill that changed federal<br />
environ[[mental]] assessment laws.^8 The SCC’s decision in <em>Rio<br />
Tinto Alcan Inc. v Carrier Sekani Tribal Council</em> did provide<br />
some guidance as to whether the duty to consult extends<br />
beyond individual resource extraction projects that impact<br />
[[Aboriginal]] territory. According to the SCC, “[[government]]<br />
action is not confined to decisions or conduct which have<br />
an immediate impact on lands and resources. A potential<br />
for adverse impact suffices. Thus, the duty to consult<br />
extends to ‘strategic, higher level decisions’ that may have<br />
an impact on [[Aboriginal]] claims and rights.”^9</p>
<p>The decision in <em>Rio Tinto</em> leads to the question: are<br />
international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement,</p>
<p>5 <em>Constitution Act, [[1982]]</em> , being Schedule B to the <em>[[Canada]] Act [[1982]] ([[UK]]</em> ),<br />
[[1982]], c 11.</p>
<p>6 <em>Haida Nation</em> , <em>supra</em> note 4 at para 35.</p>
<p>7 <em>Ibid</em> at para 16.</p>
<p>8 <em>Courtoreille v [[Canada]] ([[Aboriginal]] Affairs and [[North]]ern Development)</em> ,<br />
2[[014]] FC 1244.</p>
<p>9 <em>Rio Tinto Alcan Inc v Carrier Sekani Tribal Council,</em> [[[2010]]] 2 SCR 650 at<br />
para 44 [ <em>Rio Tinto</em> ].</p>
<p><code>“strategic high-level decisions” that impact [[Aboriginal]]
rights? [[Canada]] has acknowledged in its duty to consult
guidelines that the duty may be triggered by international
agreements.^10 As well, there are provisions in numerous
modern [[treaties]] that require consultation before [[Canada]]
consents to be bound by a new international [[treaty]] that
would give rise to new international legal obligations that
may adversely affect a right of a First Nation.^11</code></p>
<p><code>Similar to the transformative role [[Canada]]’s [[Aboriginal]]
peoples have carved out to shape resource development on
traditional territories, there is an opportunity to in[[flu]]ence
international decision making if it is determined that there
is a legal requirement to include [[indigenous]] voices when
negotiating and ratifying international environ[[mental]]
agreements. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the first
case that sought to have these procedural rights applied to
the international sphere was not in the area of environment.</code></p>
<p><code>In their memorandum of fact and law, the HFN set out some
of their asserted [[Aboriginal]] rights, including [[Aboriginal]]
title. The HFN claimed that their ability to exercise these
rights would be impacted because their self-[[government]]
powers would be constrained if the investment [[treaty]] with
[[China]] was ratified. All the rights enumerated in the HFN’s
memorandum were tied to land use, conservation and
protection of resources:</code></p>
<ul>
<li>the right to harvest, manage, protect and use fish,<br />
  wildlife, and other resources in HFN’s traditional<br />
  territory in priority to all other users, subject only to<br />
  conservation;</li>
<li>the right to have access to exclusive and preferred<br />
  areas to harvest or to use fish, wildlife and other<br />
  resources in their traditional territory;</li>
<li>the right to protect the habitats that sustain fish,<br />
  wildlife and other resources which the Hupacasath<br />
  have a right to harvest; and</li>
</ul>
<p><code>10 “Officials should assess whether provisions in land claim agreements
or self-[[government]] agreements require that consultation take place in
relation to legally binding international instruments. Second, officials
must determine whether legislation requires [[Canada]] to consult on
international instruments. Officials should seek legal advice, which
will support the broader depart[[mental]] or agency assessments and
decision-making processes.“ [[Canada]], Minister of the Department of
