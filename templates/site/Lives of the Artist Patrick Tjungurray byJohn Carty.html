<p><a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.files.wordpress.com/[[2015]]/04/patrick-tjungurrayi.jpg" title="link">image 1: Patrick-Tjungurrayi (link #2)</a>Readers who followed this blog for a 
long time know already of my admiration for John Carty’s work. John is an 
anthropologist trained at the [[Australia]]n National University under Howard 
Morphy. He has long had an interest in art [[history]], and has practiced both 
discipline throughout [[Western]] [[Australia]] for well over a decade now*.</p>
<p>Art and anthropology have rarely met so fortuitously and happily as when John 
went out to Balgo in [[2002]] to begin to learn about the art of the [[Western]] Desert.
As he explained recently in a wonderful radio interview<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/john-carty-on-patrick-tjungurrayi/6396482" title="link">3</a>, he arrived in Balgo 
speaking not a word of the languages in use there and immediately fell to 
feeling quite lost.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, heavy rains farther south in [[Western]] [[Australia]] had 
flooded out<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2009]]/10/25/worrying-for-kiwirrkura/" title="link">4</a> the community of Kiwirrkura in [[2001]] and many of those residing 
there had relocated with relatives in Balgo. Among these was a man who had spent
a good deal of his adult life in both communities.</p>
<p>Patrick was sitting down in the art centre taking a break after completing a 
large painting by indulging in the creation of a few small canvases. John 
recalls the older man man working on a little pink painting when he was invited 
by the artist to sit down. Patrick proceeded to explain to John, in a mixture of
Kukatja and English, the story he was painting, and how it was being represented
on the canvas. Thus began a friendship that has ripened into the publication of 
a lovely new book, Patrick Tjungurrayi Beyond Borders (University of [[Western]] 
[[Australia]] Press, [[2015]]), John’s biography of—and a bit of an homage to as 
well—Patrick Alatuti Tjungurrayi.</p>
<p>When I first received an advance copy of the book, I did what I always do with a
new art book: I flipped through the pages and looked at the pictures. The first 
thing to note is that Beyond Borders is visually stunning—and beyond. It is full
of beautiful, high-resolution reproductions of paintings that span Patrick’s 
career from his first exhibited canvases in the [[1986]] Balgo exhibition, Art From 
the [[Great]] Sandy Desert, through his most recent work for Papunya Tula Artists.</p>
<p>But I found myself skipping over the paintings quickly, which surprised me. 
Rather I was entranced by the photographs of Patrick himself. I wanted to study 
the many sides of this man that his portraits revealed. It’s rare to find an 
artist’s monograph that offers so many pictures of the artist himself; John says
that the rich trove of photos he came to gather made him want to use them to 
present man and the life, as well as the art.</p>
<p>In truth, this book is as much biography as art [[history]]. It demonstrates that 
with an artist of the [[Western]] Desert and of Patrick’s stature, it is impossible 
and pointless to disentangle biography from art [[history]].</p>
<p>The books opens with an amusing and affecting recounting of John’s first 
encounters with Patrick; on the radio broadcast, he claims that he met Patrick 
for the first time twice. The earlier was the encounter in the art centre I 
retold above, the latter occurred six months later, during a period of strife at
Balgo, when Patrick flew in from the skies, dreadlocks covered in ochre, 
carrying spears. There’s a funny aspect to that story, too, but you’ll have to 
read (or hear<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/booksandarts/john-carty-on-patrick-tjungurrayi/6396482" title="link">3</a>) it for yourself.</p>
<p>The first part of the book details Patrick’s early life out in the country that 
lies near the Canning Stock Route. Illustrated with paintings that depict this 
country and with historical photographs from the [[1950]]s and 60s as well as from 
the Canning Stock Route Project in [[2007]], this section summarizes the education 
and growth of the young man and his first encounters with [[white]]fellas. Some of 
these stories are part of the familiar lore of the Balgo community, especially 
the medical rescue mission that gave Helicopter Tjungurrayi his long-lasting 
soubriquet. But there is more detail about those early encounters with 
helicopters (or dragonflies) that is sometimes amusing, sometimes 
wonder-inducing.</p>
<p>In [[1958]] Patrick walked out of a solitary life in the desert and into the mission
at Balgo, where he lived for decades afterwards. Although he helped to build the
Christian church there, and had to make his accommodations with the priests, he 
maintained his stature and dignity. As John tells it:</p>
<p>Patrick interprets [Father] McGuire’s actions not as those of a man in charge,
  but of a man frightened by [[Aboriginal]] authority, of Law. This may be a 
  perceptive insight into the psychology of the missionary, but it is an even 
  more illuminating insight into Patrick himself. He does not recount the 
  conflicts, prejudice and bureaucracy of the [[white]] world he experienced from 
  [[1958]] onwards as a victim, but as a man for whom these concerns are a secondary
  consideration to his own standing in, and understanding of, another Law (p. 
  48).</p>
<p>John moves from this simply biographical perspective into the next phase of 
Patrick’s life, when he begins to paint. Patrick remembers being at Yayayi, near
Papunya, in the early 70s when the painting movement was beginning; he himself 
made his first paintings at Balgo in the late 70s. Later, he moved to 
Kiwirrkura, closer to the country he came from. His travels between the two 
communities led to him becoming [[flu]]ent in both the hot-color style of painting 
practiced at Balgo and the cerebral designs and muted colors of Papunya Tula. 
During the early years of the 21st century, following the Kiwirrkura floods, he 
traveled even more frequently between the two communities and emerged with a 
style all his own, grounded in his immense knowledge of the Law and of broad 
ranges of Country.</p>

<p>His leadership and authority were clearly manifest in the days of the Canning 
Stock Route Project, and were captured in Nicole Ma’s video, That Long Way I 
Been Travelling<a href="http://www.canningstockrouteproject.com/multimedia/film/?id=27802610" title="link">7</a>. In the large painting shown above that Patrick deploys in 
telling the story, parallel lines of concentric [[white]] square represent the wells
of the Stock Route (above) and the camps of the Tingari (below). John describes 
its importance:</p>
<p>The painting folds the [[history]] of the 20th century into the desert’s narrative
  architecture. It subjugates [[white]] myths into a bigger kind of [[history]]. And it 
  does it all through the prism of one man’s epic journey. In holding biography,
  cross-cultural [[history]] and the Dreaming together on the same plane, without 
  collapsing their differences, this painting asserts itself as a significant 
  poetic achievement in [[Australia]]n art. This big pink Country marbled in 
  parallel visions.</p>
<p>The latest chapters in Patrick’s life are co-narrated in Beyond Borders by John 
and by Sarah Brown, [[[[CEO]]]] of the [[Western]] Desert Nganampa Walytja Palyantjaku 
Tjutaku [[Aboriginal]] Corporation, or The Purple House, as it’s more commonly 
known. Patrick was among the leading artists who produced a series of paintings 
for auction in [[2000]], raising over $1 million in the [[Western]] Desert Dialysis 
Appeal. Machines purchased and installed in Alice Springs and Kintore meant that
many desert people were able to stay near country or family while undergoing 
[[treatment]] for end-stage renal disease.</p>
<p>The success of the program in meeting a widespread and growing need led the 
Territory Government to impose restrictions, barring the entry and [[treatment]] of 
people from surrounding states—including, in a cruel irony—Patrick himself when 
he became ill several years ago. Undaunted, Patrick refused [[treatment]] and 
started a media campaign. Ultimately, he was allowed to go to Alice for 
[[treatment]], and the Purple House raised funding to expand their services. They 
first provisioned a mobile dialysis unit known as the Purple Truck that serves 
communities throughout the desert. Last year a two-chair dialysis unit opened in
Kiwirrkura.</p>
<p>Patrick Tjungurrayi Beyond Borders is a worthy addition to the library of anyone
interested in [[Indigenous]] art, the [[history]] of [[Western]] [[Australia]], medical and 
social issues affecting [[Indigenous]] people, and the anthropology of the [[Western]] 
Desert. That’s a lot to claim for a mere 125 pages, but thanks to John Carty’s 
insight and s[[kill]], it’s a claim well justified. It’s a consistently surprising 
and informative read, and a sheer visual delight, both as documentary and as 
fine art. The book is a profile of a great artist and Law man by a marvelous 
anthropologist and art historian. And John will be donating all proceeds from 
sales of the book to benefit the Purple House, as if you needed another reason 
to buy a copy. That’s a powerful combination all around. Don’t miss it.</p>

<p>*John was a prime mover in the Canning Stock Route Project, which resulted in 
books that show off in some sections the art historical approach to an 
anthropology of desert art that John has undertaken: Yiwarra Kuju: The Canning 
Stock Route<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2010]]/09/05/along-the-canning-stock-route/" title="link">10</a> (National Museum of [[Australia]], [[2010]]), and Ngurra Kuju Walyja / 
One Country One People: stories from the Canning Stock Route<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2013]]/01/20/riches-of-the-canning-stock-route/" title="link">11</a> (Palgrave 
Macmillan, [[2012]]). He was also deeply involved with the exhibition and 
publication Purnu, Tjanpi, Canvas: Art of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2012]]/03/25/ngaanyatjarra-art-[[history]]/" title="link">12</a> 
(University of [[Western]] [[Australia]] Press, [[2012]]). He was among the editors of 
Desert Lake: art, [[[[science]]]], and stories from Paruku<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2013]]/05/12/the-lake-where-cultures-meet/" title="link">13</a> (CSIRO Publishing, [[2013]]),
has published a monograph on the Martu artist Billy Atkins<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2010]]/11/07/pretty-country-cannibal-country/" title="link">14</a> (Martumili 
Artists, [[2010]]), and has written about the Spinifex People in Spinifex: People of
the Sun and Shadow<a href="http://johncurtingallery.curtin.edu.au/shop/publications.cfm" title="link">15</a> (Curtin University John Curtin Gallery, [[2012]]). I am 
especially pleased that he contributed an important essay, “Rethinking [[Western]] 
Desert Abstraction,” to Crossing Cultures: The Owen and Wagner Collection of 
Contemporary [[Australia]]n [[Aboriginal]] Art at the Hood Museum of Art<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2013]]/01/06/crossing-cultures-the-catalog-in-review/" title="link">16</a> (University
Press of [[New]] England, [[2012]]).</p>
