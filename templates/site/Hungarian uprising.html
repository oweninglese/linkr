<h4>(1) George Paloczi-Horvath, was arrested by the [[Hungarian]] secret police in [[1949]]. He wrote about his experiences in the <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/Jherald.htm"><em>Daily Herald</em></a> on 11th [[December]], [[1956]].</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>With many thousands of others, I was arrested by the [[Hungarian]] secret police (AVO) in the summer of [[1949]]. It was the time when Stalin and his henchmen started to [[kill]] off thousands of their followers as part of a ludicrous propaganda drive against Tito. It was also the time when, in [[Hungary]], they started to arrest the Social Democratic leadership and the outstanding non-Muscovite Communists.</p>
<p>I believed then that we would be able to assert our innocence. But I soon found out that our fate was worse than if we had been guilty, because we had nothing to give away in the torture chambers. I was thrown into an icy cold cellar cubicle three yards by four. There was a wooden plank for a bed, and a bright naked electric light glared in my face day and night. Later, it was a great relief to return to this bleak place.</p>
<p>Now I am going to find out the secret of those rigged trials, I thought, when they took me for my first hearing. Two AVO officers questioned me in turn from 9 a.m. till 9 p.m. Then I had to type my life story till 4 a.m. The rest of the 24 hours I had to spend walking up and down in the cubicle because I was not permitted to sleep. This went on for three weeks. The only sleep I got was a few minutes when the guard was slack. The "hearings" soon became tortures. The AVO officers wanted us to invent crimes for ourselves because they knew we were innocent. I won't describe the tortures. There are so many ways to cause piercing pain to the human body. There were days when we were tossed about on a stormy ocean of pain. The torments alone did not make us "confess." Sleeplessness, hunger, utter degradation, filthy insults to human dignity, the knowledge that we were utterly at the mercy of the AVO - all this was not enough. Then they told us they would arrest our wives and [[child]]ren and torment them in front of us. We heard women and [[child]]ren screaming in adjacent rooms. Was this a put-up job for our benefit? I still don't know.</p>
<p>After the first period of torture we were sent back to our solitary cellars for some weeks to "rot away for a while." Now we were tormented by the intense cold, by the glaring bulb and the four walls which threatened to collapse on us. We had to be awake 18 hours a day. There were no books, no cigarettes, only thousands of empty minutes. Our fear now was insanity. Our heads were whirling, we imagined sounds and colours. Some of us had a nightmarish feeling of being drowned. Our emaciated bodies and feverish brains produced eerie visions and hallucinations. Is it a wonder that many of us had no sound judgment, no willpower to resist our tormentors? This torture made some confess. Others went insane, or were clubbed to [[death]]. A few held out. I could not bring myself to "confess" - that UNO and the World Federation of [[United]] Nations Associations was an imperialist [[spy]] and sabotage organisation; that the Hungarian UNA, of which the late Michael Karolyi was president and myself secretary-general, conspired to overthrow the "people's democracy."</p>
<p>After a period of "rotting," a new period of torments started. And so it went on for 13 months.</p>
<p>When at last I signed a ludicrous statement prepared by my tormentors, I was regularly collapsing three or four times a day and had lost more than thirty pounds. I had to confess that John F. Ennals, secretary-general of WFUNA, was my "[[spy]] chief" and that I handed him [[spy]] reports in Budapest daily from [[1947]] till the time of my arrest in [[1949]]. During this period Ennals spent only three days in Budapest. He was either at the Geneva headquarters or touring the five continents. When I repeatedly pointed this out to the AVO they said: "Never mind. No word of it will leak out. Your trial will be kept secret."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Suez crisis first boomed into view when the [[America]]ns and the [[British]] refused to finance the Aswan High Dam in [[Egypt]] in [[July]] [[1956]]. The [[Egypt]]ian president, Colonel Nasser, thereafter nationalised the Suez Canal....</p>
<p>With the prospect of armed intervention imminent, the Suez Emergency Committee booked Trafalgar Square for an anti-war rally on Sunday 4 [[November]]. I was in touch with Peggy Rushton, the MCF general secretary, by phone with the object of helping to mobilise support. On Thursday 1 [[November]], when I phoned, she informed me that the Labour Party had been on the line to take over the booking actually, on behalf of the National Council of Labour, representing the TUC and the co-operative movement as well. I was delighted that she had already agreed and carried on with my plans to rally [[protest]]ers. In addition, using the Epping CLP duplicator, I copied 6,000 leaflets drafted by myself and my Socialist Review colleagues, calling on workers to strike against the Suez intervention.</p>
<p>The Trafalgar Square rally turned out to be a seminal event in [[British]] Labour [[history]]. My 6,000 leaflets, which a crowd of dockers helped us to distribute, disappeared in a flash. All afternoon people were pouring into the square until it was impossible to move. At the height of the proceedings, a great chant went up in the north western [[corn]]er of the square as a massive column of student demonstrators began to come in and went on endlessly...</p>
<p>In Trafalgar Square Mike Kidron, a fellow <em>Socialist Review</em> supporter, told me (as he had left home much later) that the [[Russia]]ns were apparently going in to crush the uprising in [[Hungary]], which had occurred in the latter part of [[October]]. The [[British]] Communist Party was already in deep crisis. Ever since Nikita Krushchev, the new [[Soviet]] leader, had repudiated [[Soviet]] changes made under Stalin against Tito in Yugoslavia, which the CPGB leaders had supported, there had been widespread unease. Since then there had been Krushchev’s secret speech to the 20th [[Congress]] of the CPSU on 25 [[February]], which the Observer had published in full on 10 [[June]]. The Hungarian prime minister, Matyas Rakosi, had confessed that the trial of Laszlo Rajk, a Hungarian Communist leader who had been executed, had been rigged. In [[Poland]] Gomulka had assumed power in defiance of [[Soviet]] wishes after riots in Poznan in [[June]]. The Hungarian revolt had been the last straw, particularly when the case of Edith Bone, a [[British]] Communist who had been tortured and ill-treated in a Hungarian [[prison]], hit the news. A huge swathe of Communist Party members were in revolt at the unwavering support given by their leaders to [[Soviet]] policy under Stalin.</p>
<p>Peter Fryer, the <em>Daily Worker</em> correspondent in [[Hungary]], sent in reports which the paper refused to publish. It found another journalist, Charlie Coutts, who was prepared to defend [[Soviet]] action. Peter Fryer resigned from the Communist Party, wrote a book <em>The Hungarian Tragedy</em> in record time and joined Gerry Healy and his group.</p>
<p>Edward Thompson and John Saville were publishing <em>The Reasoner</em>, a duplicated magazine, which they refused to close down. A third of the Daily Worker’s journalists left. Key [[trade]] unionists like John Homer, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, Jack Grahl, Leo Keely, Laurence Daly (a leading [[Scottish]] miner), Les Cannon of the ETU and many others left the party. The historians Edward Thompson and John Saville quit. Christopher Hill, another historian, who with Peter Cadogan and others produced a minority report on inner party democracy, left afterwards. Besides these and other well known figures, thousands of other members were in revolt.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look at the hell that Rákosi made of [[Hungary]] and you will see an indictment, not of Marxism, not of Communism, but of Stalinism. Hypocrisy without limit; medieval cruelty; dogmas and slogans devoid of life or meaning; national pride outraged; [[poverty]] for all but a tiny handful of leaders who lived in luxury, with mansions on Rózsadomb, Budapest's pleasant Hill of Roses (nicknamed by people 'Hill of Cadres'), special schools for their [[child]]ren, special well-stocked shops for their wives - even special bathing beaches at Lake Balaton, shut off from the common people by barbed wire. And to protect the power and privileges of this Communist aristocracy, the A.V.H. - and behind them the ultimate sanction, the tanks of the [[Soviet]] Army. Against this disgusting caricature of Socialism our [[British]] Stalinists would not, could not, dared not [[protest]]; nor do they now spare a word of comfort or solidarity or pity for the gallant people who rose at last to wipe out the infamy, who stretched out their yearning hands for freedom, and who paid such a heavy price.</p>
<p>[[Hungary]] was Stalinism incarnate. Here in one small, tormented country was the picture, complete in every detail: the abandonment of humanism, the attachment of primary importance not to living, breathing, suffering, hoping human beings but to machines, targets, statistics, tractors, steel mills, plan fulfilment figures... and, of course, tanks. Struck dumb by Stalinism, we ourselves grotesquely distorted the fine Socialist principle of international solidarity by making any criticism of present injustices or inhumanitites in a Communist-led country taboo. Stalinism crippled us by castrating our moral passion, blinding us to the wrongs done to men if those wrongs were done in the name of Communism. We Communists have been indignant about the wrongs done by imperialism: those wrongs are many and vile; but our one-sided indignation has somehow not rung true. It has left a sour taste in the mouth of the [[British]] worker, who is quick to detect and condemn hypocrisy.</p>

<h4>(4) <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/COLDrakosi.htm">Matyas Rakosi</a>, article in the <em>Szabad Nep</em> (19th [[July]], [[1956]])</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>My comrades frequently mentioned in the past two years that I do not visit the factories as often as I did in the past. They were right, the only thing they did not know is that this was due to the deterioration of my [[health]]. My state of [[health]] began to tell on the quality and amount of work I was able to perform, a fact that is bound to cause harm to the Party in such an important post. So much about the state of my [[health]].</p>
<p>A regards the mistakes that I committed in the field of the "cult of personality" and the violation of socialist legality, I admitted them at the meetings of the Central Committee in [[June]], [[1953]], and I have made the same admission repeatedly ever since. I have also exercised self-criticism publicly.</p>
<p>After the 20th [[Congress]] of the CPSU and Comrade Khrushchev's speech it became clear to me that the weight and effect of these mistakes were greater than I had thought and that the harm done to our Party ,through these mistakes was much more serious than I had previously believed.</p>
<p>These mistakes have made our Party's work more difficult, they diminished the strength of attractiveness of the Party and of the People's Democracy, they hindered the development of the Leninist norms of Party life, of collective leadership, of constructive criticism, and self- criticism, of democratism in Party and state life, and of the initiative and creative power of the wide masses of the working class.</p>
<p>Finally, these mistakes offered the enemy an extremely wide opportunity for attack. In their totality, the mistakes that I committed in the most important post of Party work have caused serious harm to our socialist development as a whole.</p>
<p>It was up to me to take the lead in repairing these mistakes. If rehabilitation has at times proceeded sluggishly and with intermittent breaks, if a certain relapse was noticed last year in the liquidation of the cult of personality, if criticism</p>
<p>and self-criticism together with collective leadership have developed at a slow pace, if sectarian and dogmatic views have not been combated resolutely enough - then for all this, undoubtedly, serious reponsibility weighs upon me, having occupied the post of the First Secretary of the Party.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The [[revolution]] which broke out on the 23rd [[October]] on Joseph-Bem-Square started off as a peaceful manifestation. The students' demands, summed up in sixteen points and distributed in the streets of Budapest in the form of leaflets, were those of impatient [[revolution]]ary youth.</p>
<p>Certain observers insist on the essentially nationalistic characteristics of the manifestations. Incontestably the presence of the [[Soviet]] Army on Hungarian territory, the visible outward signs of foreign occupation (there was no practical difference between [[Soviet]] and Hungarian uniforms), rekindled the flame of Hungarian nationalism which had never been extinguished. But it was not only a question of nationalism; the students of Budapest also wanted true socialism.</p>
<p>It was for free independent Socialism that young Hungarians began the struggle against the only armed fascists who on the night of the 23rd [[October]] still wished to save their [[government]]: the red fascists of the political police, appointed to safeguard the last vestiges of the Stalinist [[government]].</p>
<p>Numerous eye-witnesses have affirmed that at the beginning of the [[revolution]] the insurgents had no arms. It was only after Gero's menacing and disastrous speech on his return from Belgrade that the State Police (which must not be confused with the "AVO", or political police) joined the students and distributed arms to them in front of the Hungarian radio broadcasting house in Sandor-Brody Street. Next morning the entire Budapest garrison officers, non-commissioned officers and soldiers, joined the students and opened armament depots to them.</p>
<p>The officers responsible were nearly all of them Communists and not "fascist agents or Horthyist officers." The Army's revolt was a result of the turn of events which took place during the night on the banks of the Danube in the neo-Gothic building which overlooks Pariiament.</p>
<p>On the second floor an extraordinary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, presided over by Gero, took place at 22.50. Thanks to a personal report by one of the participants, it is possible to give a detailed account of this historic meeting. Assessing the situation, Gero began by trying to convince his colleagues of the necessity of a [[Soviet]] intervention, as the "popular forces" were being overwhelmed and the [[government]] was in danger. Janos Kadar and then Gyula Kallai (another Titoist who had just been released from [[prison]]) replied that the only way to avoid catastrophe was for Gero to resign immediately. Istvan Hidas (Vice [[President]]) and Laszlo Piros (Home Secretary) violently opposed this suggestion. Piros referred to Imre Nagy and his friends as "accomplices of the fascists who are at the moment sweeping through the capital."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been the witness today of one of the great events of [[history]] I have seen the people of Budapest catch the fire lit in Poznan and [[[[War]]saw]] and come out into the streets in open [[rebellion]] against their [[Soviet]] overlords. I have marched with them and almost wept for joy with them as the [[Soviet]] emblems in the Hungarian flags were torn out by the angry and exalted crowds. And the great point about the [[rebellion]] is that it looks like being successful.</p>
<p>As I telephone this dispatch I can hear the roar of delirious crowds made up of student girls and boys, of Hungarian soldiers still wearing their [[Russia]]n-type uniforms, and overalled factory workers marching through Budapest and shouting defiance against [[Russia]]. "Send the Red Army home," they roar. "We want free and secret elections." And then comes the ominous cry which one always seems to hear on these occasions: "Death to Rakosi." Death to the former [[Soviet]] puppet dictator - now taking a 'cure' on the [[Russia]]n Black Sea Riviera - whom the crowds blame for all the ills that have befallen their country in eleven years of [[Soviet]] puppet rule.</p>
<p>Leaflets demanding the instant withdrawal of the Red Army and the sacking of the present Government are being showered among the street crowds from trams. The leaflets have been printed secretly by students who "managed to get access", as they put it, to a printing shop when newspapers refused to publish their political programme. On house walls all over the city primitively stencilled sheets have been pasted up listing the sixteen demands of the rebels.</p>
<p>But the fantastic and, to my mind, really super-ingenious feature of this national rising against the Hammer and Sickle, is that it is being carried on under the protective red mantle of pretended Communist orthodoxy. Gigantic portraits of Lenin are being carried at the head of the marchers. The purged ex-[[Premier]] Imre Nagy, who only in the last couple of weeks has been readmitted to the Hungarian Communist Party, is the rebels' chosen champion and the leader whom they demand must be given charge of a new free and independent [[Hungary]]. Indeed, the Socialism of this ex-[[Premier]] and - this is my bet - [[Premier]]-soon-to-be-again, is no doubt genuine enough. But the youths in the crowd, to my mind, were in the vast majority as anti-Communist as they were anti-[[Soviet]] - that is, if you agree with me that calling for the removal of the Red Army is anti-[[Soviet]].</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Late in the evening of [[October]] 23 underground reactionary organizations attempted to start a counter-[[revolution]]ary revolt against the people's regime in Budapest.</p>
<p>This enemy adventure had obviously been in preparation for some time. The forces of foreign reaction have been systematically inciting anti-democratic elements for action against the lawfulauthority.</p>
<p>Enemy elements made use of the student demonstration that took place on 23 [[October]] to bring out into the streets groups previously prepared by them, to form the nucleus of the revolt. They sent agitators into action who created confusion and tried to provoke mass disorder.</p>
<p>A number of [[government]]al buildings and public enterprises were attacked. The fascist thugs who let themselves go began to loot shops, break windows in houses and institutions, and tried to destroy the equipment of industrial enterprises. Groups of rebels who succeeded in getting hold of arms caused bloodshed in a number of places.</p>
<p>The forces of [[revolution]]ary order began to repel the rebels. On orders of the reappointed [[Premier]] Imre Nagy martial law was declared in the city.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Government asked the USSR Government for help. In accordance with this request, [[Soviet]] military units, which are in [[Hungary]] under the terms of the [[[[War]]saw]] [[treaty]], helped troops of the Hungarian Republic to restore order in Budapest. In many industrial enterprises workers offered armed resistance to the bandits who tried to damage and destroy equipment and to mount armed guards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Workers, comrades! The demonstration of university youth, which began with the formulation of, on the whole, acceptable demands, has swiftly degenerated into a demonstration against our democratic order; and under the cover of this demonstration an armed attack has broken out. It is only with burning anger that we can speak of this attack by counter-[[revolution]]ary reactionary elements against the capital of our country, against our people's democratic order and the power of the working class. Towards the rebels who have risen with arms in their hands against the legal order of our People's Republic, the Central Committee of our Party and our Government have adopted the only correct attitude: only surrender or complete defeat can await those who stubbornly continue their murderous, and at the same time completely hopeless, fight against the order of our working people.</p>
<p>At the same time we are aware that the provocateurs, going into the fight surreptitiously, have been using as cover many people who went astray in the hours of chaos, and especially many young people whom we cannot regard as the conscious enemies of our regime. Accordingly, now that we have reached the stage of liquidating the hostile attack, and with a view to avoiding further bloodshed, we have offered and are offering to those misguided individuals who are willing to surrender on demand, the opportunity of saving their lives and their future, and of returning to the camp of honest people.</p>

<h4>(9) <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/COLDgero.htm">Erno Gero</a>, speech (24th [[October]], [[1956]])</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Comrades, Beloved Friends, Working People of [[Hungary]]! Of course we want a socialist democracy and not a bourgeois democracy. In accord with our Party and our convictions, our working class and people are jealously guarding the achievements of our people's democracy, and they will not permit anyone to touch them. We shall defend these achievements under all circumstances from whichever quarter they may be threatened. Today the chief aim of the enemies of our people is to shake the power of the working class, to loosen the peasant-worker [[alliance]], to undermine the leadership of the working class in our country and to upset their faith in its party, in the Hungarian Workers' Party. They are endeavouring to loosen the close friendly relations between our nation, the Hungarian People's Republic, and other countries building socialism, especially between our country and the socialist [[Soviet]] Union. They are trying to loosen the ties between our party and the glorious Communist Party of the [[Soviet]] Union, the party of Lenin, the party of the 20th [[Congress]].</p>
<p>They slander the [[Soviet]] Union. They assert that we [[trade]] with the [[Soviet]] Union on an unequal footing, that our relations with the [[Soviet]] Union are not based on equality, and allege that our independence has to be defended, not against the imperialists, but against the [[Soviet]] Union. All this is a barefaced lie - hostile slanders which do not contain a grain of truth. The truth is that the [[Soviet]] Union has not only liberated our people from the yoke of Horthy fascism and German imperialism, but that even at the end of the war, when our country lay prostrate, she stood by us and concluded pacts with us on the basis of full equality; ever since, she has been pursuing this policy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The 5,000 students who were meeting in front of the Petofi Monument in Budapest were joined shortly after dusk by thousands of workers and others. The great crowd then marched to the Stalin monument. Ropes were wound round the statue's neck, and, to cheers, the crowd attempted to topple the statue. But it would not budge. They finally managed to melt Stalin's knees by using welding torches.</p>

<h4>(11) <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/COLDnagy.htm">Imre Nagy</a>, Radio Kossuth (25th [[October]], [[1956]])</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>People of Budapest, I announce that all those who cease fighting before 14.00 today, and lay down their arms in the interest of avoiding further bloodshed, will be exempted from martial law. At the same time I state that as soon as possible and by all the means at our disposal, we shall realise, on the basis of the [[June]] [[1953]] Government program which I expounded in Parliament at that time, the systematic democratization of our country in every sphere of Party, State, political and economic life. Heed our appeal. Cease fighting, and secure the 'restoration of calm and order in the interest of the future of our people and nation. Return to peaceful and creative work!</p>
<p>Hungarians, Comrades, my friends! I speak to you in a moment filled with responsibility. As you know, on the basis of the confidence of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Workers' Party and the [[President]]ial Council, I have taken over the leadership of the Government as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Every possibility exists for the Government to realise my political program by relying on the Hungarian people under the leadership of the Communists. The essence of this program, as you know, is the far-reaching democratization of Hungarian public life, the realisation of a Hungarian road to socialism in accord with our own national characteristics, and the realisation of our lofty national aim: the radical improvement of the workers' living conditions.</p>
<p>However, in order to begin this work - together with you - the first necessity is to establish order, discipline and calm. The hostile elements that joined the ranks of peacefully demonstrating Hungarian youth, misled many well-meaning workers and turned against the people's democracy, against the power of the people. The paramount task facing everyone now is the urgent consolidation of our position. Afterwards, we shall be able to discuss every question, since the Government and the majority of the Hungarian people want the same thing. In referring to our great common responsibility for our national existence, I appeal to you, to every man, woman, youth, worker, peasant, and intellectual to stand fast and keep calm; resist provocation, help restore order, and assist our forces in maintaining order. Together we must prevent bloodshed, and we must not let this sacred national program be soiled by blood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The troops in Budapest, as later in the provinces, were of two minds: there were those who were neutral and there were those who were prepared to join the people and fight alongside them. The neutral ones (probably the minority) were prepared to hand over their arms to the workers and students so that they could do [[battle]] against the A.V.H. with them. The others brought their arms with them when they joined the [[revolution]]. Furthermore, many sporting rifles were taken by the workers from the factory armouries of the Hungarian Voluntary Defence Organisation. The "mystery" of how the people were armed is no mystery at all. No one has yet been able to produce a single weapon manufactured in the West.</p>
<p>The Hungarian Stalinists, having made two calamitous mistakes, now made a third - or rather, it would be charitable to say, had it thrust on them by the [[Soviet]] Union. This was the decision to invoke a non-existent clause of the [[[[War]]saw]] [[Treaty]] and call in [[Soviet]] troops. This first [[Soviet]] intervention gave the people's movement exactly the impetus needed to make it united, violent and nation-wide. It seems probable, on the evidence, that [[Soviet]] troops were already in action three or four hours before the appeal, made in the name of Imre Nagy as his first act on becoming Prime Minister. That is debatable, but what is not debatable is that the appeal was in reality made by Gero and Hegedus; the evidence of this was later found and made public. Nagy became Prime Minister precisely twenty-four hours too late, and those who throw mud at him for making concessions to the Right in the ten days he held office should consider the appalling mess that was put into his hands by the Stalinists when, in desperation, they officially quit the stage.</p>
<p>With Nagy in office it would still have been possible to avert the ultimate tragedy if the people's two demands had been met immediately - if the [[Soviet]] troops had withdrawn without delay, and if the security police had been disbanded. But Nagy was not a free agent during the first few days of his premiership. It was known in Budapest that his first broadcast were made - metaphorically, if not literally - with a tommy-gun in his back.</p>

<h4>(13) Noel Barber, <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/Jmail.htm"><em>Daily Mail</em></a> (27th [[October]], [[1956]])</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Tonight Budapest is a city of mourning. Black flags hang from every window. For during the past four days thousands of its citizens fighting to throw off the yoke of [[Russia]] have been [[kill]]ed or wounded. Budapest is a city that is slowly dying. Its streets and once-beautiful squares are a shamble of broken glass, burnt-out cars and tanks, and rubble. Food is scarce, petrol is running out.</p>
<p>But still the [[battle]] rages on. For five hours this morning until a misty dawn broke over Budapest I was in the thick of one of the [[battle]]s. It was between [[Soviet]] troops and insurgents trying to force a passage across the Danube.</p>
<p>Two of the rebels into whose ranks I literally wandered died in the [[battle]], one of them in my arms. Several were wounded. Tonight, as I write this dispatch, heavy firing is shaking the city, which is still sealed off from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>To get here I drove through endless [[Russia]]n check points and through fighting that has now [[kill]]ed thousands of civilians. Where formerly the trams ran, the insurgents have torn up the rails to use as anti-tank weapons. At least 70 tanks have been smashed so far, many with Molotov cocktails. Their burnt-out skeletons seem everywhere, spread on both sides of the Danube. Even trees have been dug out as anti-tank barricades. Burned-out cars are used by the rebels at every street [[corn]]er, but still the [[Soviet]] tanks are rumbling through the city. There are at least 50 still in action, together with armoured cars and troop carriers. They fire on anything, almost at sight.</p>
<p>At the moment I can hear, like thunder rolling in the distance, the sound of their 85 mm. guns. They are battling for some objective which sounds about a quarter of a mile away. The Chain Bridge probably. The insurgents have plenty of ammunition, stored in a central dump, but it is all for automatic weapons and the making of Molotov Cocktails.</p>
<p>Travelling around the city is a nightmare, for no one knows who is friend or foe, and all shoot at everybody. There is no doubt now the revolt has been far more bloody than the official radio reports suggested. Casualties number many thousands. The [[Russia]]n are just unloosing murder at every street [[corn]]er.... I owe my life to a young girl insurgent who, speaking a little English, helped me to safety after the [[Russia]]ns had opened fire on my car.</p>
<p>It took me three hours to drive from the border to the outskirts of Buda, the hilly part of Budapest. Twice on the way I was stopped by [[Soviet]] troops. But each time I persuaded them to let me through. I made for the Chain Bridge that spans the Danube. In front of the bridge stood a barricade of burned out tramcars, a bus, old cars, and uprooted tramlines. It was at least the 50th barricade of its kind I had seen since I entered the city. As I drove towards it, lights full on and the Chain Bridge on my left, heavy Bring started from the centre of the bridge. Machine-gun bullets whistled past the car. Then, when some heavier stuff began falling I switched off the lights, jumped out and crawled round to the side.</p>
<p>It was foggy. For ten minutes the firing, in a desultory fashion, went on. Then I heard a whispered voice - a woman's. She spoke first in German, crawled round to where I was crouching, then in halting English told me to get back in my car. She herself, walking, crouched by the car, guided me into a side street. Then, together, we darted back to the road-block.</p>
<p>I found nine boys there, their average age about 18. Three wore Hungarian uniform, but with the hated Red Star torn off. Others wore red, green, and [[white]] armbands, the national colours of [[Hungary]]. All had sub-machine guns. Their pockets were filled with ammunition. The girl, whose name I discovered was Paula, had a gun too.</p>
<p>Half-way across the bridge I could see the dim outlines of two [[Soviet]] tanks. For an hour they fired at us. But never a direct hit - a shell smashed straight through the bus. One of the boys was [[kill]]ed instantly. I tried to help a second boy who was hurt, but he died five minutes later. The shelling went on. We crouched under cover and only splinters hit us. The rebels kept up machine-gun fire all the time. Paula was wounded in the arm, but not seriously. I helped her dress it with one of my handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>"Now you see what we are fighting against", said Paula. She was wearing slacks, bright blue shoes, and a green overcoat.</p>
<p>"We will never give in - never", she said.</p>
<p>"Never until the [[Russia]]ns are out of [[Hungary]] and the AVH (she pronounced it Avo) is dissolved".</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It looked Wednesday as if the intervention of [[Soviet]] troops, who had been called in at 4.30 o'clock that morning, had quelled the revolt. The [[Soviet]] forces had eighty tanks, artillery, armored cars and other equipment of a variety normally possessed only by a complete [[Soviet]] mechanized division. The insurgent Hungarian students and workers at no time had more than small arms furnished by sympathizing soldiers of the Hungarian Army.</p>
<p>What revived the revolt was a massacre. Since only a few minutes earlier [[Soviet]] tank crews had been fraternizing with insurgents, it is possible that the massacre was a tragic mistake. The most credible version is that the political policemen opened fire on the demonstrators and panicked the [[Soviet]] tank crews into the belief that they were being attacked.</p>
<p>But in any case when the firing subsided Parliament Square was littered with dead and dying men and women. The total number of casualties has been estimated at 170. This correspondent can testify that he saw a dozen bodies.</p>
<p>Far from deterring the demonstration, the firing embittered and inflamed the Hungarian people. A few minutes later and only a few blocks from the scene of the massacre, the surviving demonstrators reassembled in Szabadsag (the word means [[liberty]]) Square. When trucks filled with Hungarian soldiers drove up and warned the demonstrators that they were armed, the leader of the demonstrators brandished a Hungarian flag and replied: "We are armed only with this, but it is enough".</p>
<p>On a balcony above appeared an elderly Hungarian clad in pyjamas and a dressing gown and clasping a huge flag. He threw it down to the demonstrators.</p>
<p>Another man mounted a ladder to tear down the [[Soviet]] emblem from the "Liberty" monument in "Liberty" square. It was erected in [[1945]] by the [[Russia]]ns with forced Hungarian labor.</p>
<p>A crowd assembled before the [[United]] [[States]] legation in the square and shouted: "The workers are being [[murdered]], we want help." Finally Spencer Bames, Charge d'Affaires, told them that their case was one for decision by his Government and the [[United]] Nations, not for the local staff. The [[British]] Minister had received a deputation and given it the same message.</p>
<p>Among those watching this demonstration was a furtive figure clad in a leather coat. Suddenly someone identified him rightly or wrongly as a member of the hated AVO, the Hungarian political police. Like tigers the crowd turned on him, began to beat him and hustled him into a courtyard. A few minutes later they emerged rubbing their hands with satisfaction. The leather-coated figure was seen no more.</p>
<p>During all these activities and while [[Soviet]] tanks continued to race through near-by streets firing their fusillades, the crowd never ceased shouting: "Down with Gerol" Less than an hour later the radio announced that Mr. Gero had been replaced by Janos Kadar, former Interior Minister and second secretary of the party.</p>

<p>I consider it of great importance that a Government has been formed representing every shade and stratum of the Hungarian people that wants progress and socialism. It was a great mistake of the previous regime to become isolated from those creative elements with whose help the Hungarian road to socialism could have been successfully taken. The main task of the new Government is to make a most radical break with narrow-minded and petty trends, and to make use of every sound popular initiative, so that every true Hungarian can look upon the socialist fatherland as his own. The task of the Ministry of People's Culture is the realisation of these principal aims in the sphere of culture. The Hungarian people have an exceptionally rich tradition in almost every field of culture. We do not want to build socialism out of air; we do not want to bring it into [[Hungary]] as an imported article. What we want is that the Hungarian people work out, organically, and by long, glorious and successful work, a socialist culture worthy of the Hungarian people's great and ancient achievements, and which, as a socialist culture, can place Hungarian culture on even broader foundations with even deeper roots.</p>

<p>Hungarian workers, soldiers, peasants and intellectuals. The constantly widening scope of the [[revolution]]ary movement in our country, the tremendous force of the democratic movement has brought our country to a cross-road. The National Government, in full agreement with the Presidium of the Hungarian Workers' Party, has decided to take a step vital for the future of the whole nation, and of which I want to inform the Hungarian working people.</p>
<p>In the interest of further democratization of the country's life, the cabinet abolishes the one-party system and places the country's Government on the basis of democratic cooperation between coalition parties as they existed in [[1945]]. In accordance with this decision a new national [[government]] - with a small inner cabinet - has been established, at the moment with only limited powers.</p>
<p>The members of the new Cabinet are Imre Nagy, Zoltan Tildy, Bela Kovacs, Ferenc Erdei, Janos Kadar, Geza Losonczy and a person whom the Social Democratic Party will appoint later.</p>
<p>The [[government]] is going to submit to the [[President]]ial Council of the People's Republic its proposition to appoint Janos Kadar and Geza Losonczy as Ministers of State.</p>
<p>This Provisional Government has appealed to the [[Soviet]] General Command to begin immediately with the withdrawal of [[Soviet]] troops from the territory of Budapest. At the same time, we wish to inform the people of [[Hungary]] that we are going to request the Government of the [[Soviet]] Union to withdraw [[Soviet]] troops completely from the entire territory of the Hungarian Republic.</p>
<p>On behalf of the National Government I wish to declare that it recognizes all autonomous, democratic, local authorities which were formed by the [[revolution]]; we will rely on them and we ask for their full support.</p>
<p>Hungarian brothers, patriotic citizens of [[Hungary]]! Safeguard the achievements of the [[revolution]]! We have to re-establish order first of all! We have to restore peaceful conditions! No blood should be shed by fratricide in our country! Prevent all further disturbances! Assure the safety of life and [[property]] with all your might!</p>

Moved by the deep sense of responsibility to spare our nation and working masses further bloodshed, I declare that every member of the Presidium of the Hungarian Workers' Party agrees with today's decisions by the Council of Ministers. As for myself, I can add that I am in wholehearted agreement with those who spoke before me, Imre Nagy, Zoltan Tildy and Ferenc Erdei. They are my acquaintances and friends, my esteemed and respected compatriots.</p>
<p>I address myself to the Communists, to those Communists who were prompted to join the Party by the progressive ideas of mankind and socialism, and not by selfish personal interests - let us represent our pure and just ideas by pure and just means.</p>
<p>My comrades, my fellow workers! Bad leadership during the past years has cast on our Party the shadow of great and grave burdens. We must fully rid ourselves of these burdens, of all accusations against the Party. This must be done with a clear con[[[[science]]]], with courage and straight-forward resolution. The ranks of the Party will thin out, but I do not fear that pure, honest and well-meaning Communists will be disloyal to their ideals. Those who joined us for selfish personal reasons, for a career or other motives will be the ones to leave. But, having got rid of this ballast and the burden of past crimes by certain persons in our leadership, we will fight, even if to some extent from scratch, under more favourable and clearer conditions for the benefit of our ideas, our people, our compatriots and country.</p>
<p>I ask every Communist individually to set an example, by deeds and without pretense, a real example worthy of a man and a Communist, in restoring order, starting normal life, in resuming work and production, and in laying the foundations of an ordered life. Only with the honour thus acquired can we earn the respect of our other compatriots as well.</p>

<p>In their glorious uprising our people have shaken off the Rakosi regime. They have achieved freedom for the people and independence for the country. Without this there can be no socialism. We can safely say that the ideological and organisational leaders who prepared this uprising were recruited from among your ranks. Hungarian Communist writers, journalists, university students, the youth of the Petofi Circle, thousands and thousands of workers and peasants, and veteran fighters who had been im[[prison]]ed on false charges, fought in the front line against Rakosiite despotism and political hooliganism.</p>
<p>In these momentous hours the Communists who fought against the despotism of Rakosi have decided, in accordance with the wish of many true patriots and socialists, to form a new Party. The new Party will break away from the crimes of the past for once and for all. It will defend the honour and independence of our country against anyone. On this basis, the basis of national independence, it will build fraternal relations with any progressive socialist movement and party in the world.</p>
<p>In these momentous hours of our [[history]] we call on every Hungarian worker who is led by devotion to the people and the country to join our Party, the name of which is the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party. The Party counts on the support of every honest worker who declares himself in favour of the socialist objectives of the working class. The Party invites into its ranks every Hungarian worker who adopts these principles and who is not responsible for the criminal policy and mistakes of the Rakosi-clique. We expect everybody to join who, in the past, was deterred from service to socialism by the anti-national policy and criminal deeds of Rakosi and his followers.</p>

<p>Nowadays it is often emphasized that the speaker breaking away from the practice of the past is speaking sincerely. I cannot say this in such a way. I need not break with my past; by the grace of God I am the same as I was before my im[[prison]]ment. I stand by my conviction physically and spiritually intact, just as I was eight years ago, although im[[prison]]ment has left its mark on me. Nor can I say that now I will speak more sincerely, for I have always spoken sincerely.</p>
<p>Now is the first instance in [[history]] that [[Hungary]] is enjoying the sympathy of all civilized nations. We are deeply moved by this. A small nation has heartfelt joy that because of its love of [[liberty]] the other nations have taken up its cause. We see Providence in this, expressed by the solidarity of foreign nations just as it says in our national anthem: "God bless the Hungarian - reach out to him Thy protective hand." Then our national anthem continues; "when he is fighting against his enemy." But we, even in our extremely severe situation, hope that we have no enemy! For we are not enemies of anyone. We desire to live in friendship with every people and with every country.</p>
<p>We, the little nation, desire to live in friendship and in mutual respect with the great [[America]]n [[United]] [[States]] and with the mighty [[Russia]]n Empire alike, in good neighborly relationship with Prague, Bucharest, [[[[War]]saw]], and Belgrade. In this regard I must mention that for the brotherly understanding in our present suffering every Hungarian has embraced [[Austria]] to his heart.</p>
<p>And now, our entire position is decided by what the [[Russia]]n Empire of 200 millions intends to do with the military force standing within our frontiers. Radio announcements say that this military force is growing. We are neutral, we give the [[Russia]]n Empire no cause for bloodshed. But has the idea not occurred to the leader of the [[Russia]]n Empire that we will respect the [[Russia]]n people far more if it does not oppress us. It is only an enemy people which is attacked by another country. We have not attacked [[Russia]] and sincerely hope that the withdrawal of [[Russia]]n military forces from our country will soon occur.</p>
<p>This has been a freedom fight which was unparalleled in the world, with the young generation at the head of the nation. The fight for freedom was fought because the nation wanted to decide freely on how it should live. It wants to be free to decide about the management of its state and the use of its labor. The people themselves will not permit this fact to be distorted to the advantage of some unauthorized powers or hidden motives. We need new elections - without abuses - at which every party can nominate.</p>

<h4>(24) George Paloczi-Horvath, <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/Jherald.htm">Daily Herald</a> (4th [[November]], [[1956]])</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>It was dawn . . . the day the [[Russia]]ns struck again. We were awakened by the roar of heavy guns. The radio was a shambles. All we got was the national anthem, played over and over again, and continual repetition of [[Premier]] Nagy's announcement that after a token resistance we must cease fighting and appeal to the free world for help.</p>
<p>After our ten days' war of [[liberty]]; after the pathetically short period of our 'victory', this was a terrible blow. But there was not time to sit paralysed in despair. The [[Russia]]ns had arrested General Maleter, head of the Central Revolutionary Armed Forces Council. The Army had received ceasefire orders. But what of the fighting groups of workers and students?</p>
<p>These courageous civilian units now had to be told to put up only token resistance in order to save bloodshed. They had been instructed not to start firing.</p>
<p>I called up the biggest group, the 'Corvin regiment.' A deputy commander answered the phone. His voice was curiously calm: "Yes, we realized we should not open fire. But the [[Russia]]ns did. They took up positions around our block and opened fire with everything they had. The cellars are filled with 200 wounded and dead. But we will fight to the last man. There is no choice. But inform [[Premier]] Nagy that we did not start the fight."</p>
<p>This was just before seven in the morning. [[Premier]] Nagy, alas, could not be informed any more. He was not to be found.</p>
<p>The situation was the same everywhere. [[Soviet]] tanks rolled in and started to shoot at every centre of resistance which had defied them during our first [[battle]] for freedom. This time, the [[Russia]]ns shot the buildings to smithereens. Freedom fighters were trapped in the various barracks, public buildings and blocks of flats. The [[Russia]]ns were going to [[kill]] them off to the last man. And they knew it. They fought on till [[death]] claimed them.</p>
<p>This senseless [[Russia]]n massacre provoked the second phase of armed resistance. The installation of Radar's puppet [[government]] was only oil on the fire. After our fighting days, after our brief span of [[liberty]] and democracy. Radar's hideous slogans and stupid lies, couched in the hated Stalinite terminology, made everyone's blood boil. Although ten million witnesses knew the contrary, the puppet [[government]] brought forward the ludicrous lie that our war of [[liberty]] was a counter-[[revolution]]ary uprising inspired by a handful of Fascists.</p>
<p>The answer was bitter fighting and a general strike throughout the country. In the old [[revolution]]ary centres - the industrial suburbs of Csepel, Ujpest and the rest - the workers struck and fought desperately against the [[Russia]]n tanks.</p>
<p>Posters on the walls challenged the lies of the puppet Government: "The 40,000 aristocrats antifascists of the Csepel works strike on!" said one of them.</p>
<p>"The general strike is a weapon which can be used only when the entire working class is unanimous - so don't call us Fascists,'" said another.</p>
<p>Armed resistance stopped first. The [[Russia]]ns [[bomb]]arded to rubble every house from which a single shot was fired. The fighting groups realized that further [[battle]]s would mean the annihilation of the capital. So they stopped fighting.</p>
<p>But the strike went on.</p>

<h4>(25) Leslie Bain's interview with <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/COLDkovacs.htm">Bela Kovacs</a> appeared in the <em>[[New]] York Reporter</em> on 13th [[December]], [[1956]].</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Late in the evening of Sunday, [[November]] 4 - a night of terror in Budapest that no one who lived through it will ever forget - I met Bela Kovacs, one of the leaders of [[Hungary]]'s short-lived [[revolution]]ary [[government]], in a cellar in the city's center.</p>
<p>Kovacs, as a Minister of State of the Nagy regime, had started oft for the Parliament Building early that morning, but he never reached it. [[Soviet]] tanks were there ahead of him. Now he squatted on the floor opposite me, a fugitive from [[Soviet]] search squads.</p>
<p>A hunched, stocky man, with a thin mustache and half-closed eyes, Bela Kovacs was only a shadow of the robust figure he once had been. Now in his early fifties, he had risen to prominence after the war as one of the top leaders of the Hungarian Independent Smallholders Party. Back in [[1947]], when Matyas Rakosi began taking over the [[government]] with the support of the [[Soviet]] occupation forces, Kovacs had achieved fame by being the only outstanding anti-Communist Hungarian leader to defy Rakosi and continue open opposition. His prestige had become so great among the peasantry that at first the Communists had not molested him. But then the [[Soviet]]s themselves stepped in, arresting him on a trumped-up charge of plotting against the occupation forces and sentencing him to life im[[prison]]ment. After eight years in Siberia, Kovacs was returned to [[Hungary]] and transferred to a Hungarian [[jail]], from which he was released in the spring of [[1956]], broken in body but not in spirit by his long ordeal. After what was called his "rehabilitation," Kovacs was visited by his old enemy Rakosi, who called to pay his respects. Rakosi was met at the door by this message from Kovacs: "I do not receive murderers in my home."</p>
<p>So long as Nagy's [[government]] was still under the thumb of the Communist Politburo, Kovacs refused to have anything to do with the new regime. Only in the surge of the late [[October]] uprising, when Nagy succeeded in freeing himself from his former associates and cast about to form a coalition [[government]], did Kovacs consent to lend his name and immense popularity to it.</p>
<p>I asked Kovacs whether he felt the Nagy [[government]]'s declaration of neutrality had aroused the [[Soviet]] leaders to action. No, he thought that the decision to crush the Hungarian [[revolution]] was taken earlier and independently of it. Obviously the [[Russia]]ns would not have rejoiced at a neutral [[Hungary]], but so long as economic cooperation between the states in the area was assured the [[Russia]]ns and their satellites should not have been too unhappy.</p>
<p>In that regard, Kovacs assured me, there was never a thought in the Nagy [[government]] of interrupting the economic co-operation of the Danubian states. "It would have been suicidal for us to try tactics hostile to the bloc. What we wanted was simply the right to sell our product to the best advantage of our people and buy our necessities where we could do it most advantageously."</p>
<p>"Then in your estimation there was no reason why the [[Russia]]ns should have come again and destroyed the [[revolution]]?"</p>
<p>"None unless they are trying to revert to the old Stalinist days. But if that is what they really are trying - and at the moment it looks like it - they will fail, even more miserably than before. The tragedy of all this is that they are burning all the bridges which could lead to a peaceful solution."</p>
<p>How much truth was in the [[Russia]]n assertion that the [[revolution]] had become a counter-[[revolution]] and that therefore [[Russia]]n intervention was justified?</p>
<p>"I tell you," said Kovacs, "this was a [[revolution]] from inside, led by Communists. There is not a shred of evidence that it was otherwise. Communists outraged by their own doings prepared the ground for it and fought for it during the first few days. This enabled us former non-Communist party leaders to come forward and demand a share in [[Hungary]]'s future. Subsequently this was granted by Nagy, and the Social Democratic, Independent Smallholders, and Hungarian Peasant parties were reconstituted. True, there was a small fringe of extremists in the streets and there was also evidence of a movement which seemed to have ties with the exiled Nazis and Nyilas of former days. But at no time was their strength such as to cause concern. No one in [[Hungary]] cares for those who fled to the West after their own corrupt terror regime was finished - and then got their financing from the West. Had there been an attempt to put them in power, all [[Hungary]] would haven risen instantly ..."</p>
<p>"What of the future?" I asked. After some hesitation Kovacs said: "All is not lost, for it is impossible for the [[Russia]]ns and their puppets to maintain themselves against the determined resistance of the Hungarians. The day will come when a fateful choice will have to be made: Exterminate the entire population by slow starvation and police terror or else accept the irreducible demand - the withdrawal of [[Soviet]] forces from our country."</p>

<p>The fighting in Budapest is over. The streets are crowded. It is at once a city at peace and a city at war. The crowds in the streets, the workers of the factories, have no thought of resuming work. The people filling the city's main thoroughfares are part of a huge silent demonstration of [[protest]]. In an unending line they file past the damaged and destroyed houses, silently point to the shell holes and heaps of rubble that were once walls, and pass on.</p>
<p>The workers are streaming back to the factories but only to collect their pay - in most cases 50 per cent of their wages - and then go home. Sometimes they assemble for mass meetings in their factories, where resolutions are passed demanding an immediate withdrawal of [[Soviet]] troops, the formation of a Government under Imre Nagy, the admission of [[United]] Nations observers into the country, the establishment of a neutral [[Hungary]], and free elections - though this last point is omitted in some resolutions. No work will be done except by public facilities and food services, the resolutions say, until the workers' demands have been conceded.</p>
<p>Leaflets, some of them printed, some cyclo-styled, spread the texts of these resolutions through the city. Government posters calling for a return to work are plastered over with these leaflets and with smaller handwritten posters calling for a continuation of the general strike.</p>
<p>The fighting in Budapest is over but the fight is on. And it is a grimmer fight than during the days when shells were whizzing past and boys and girls with Molotov cocktails were throwing themselves at [[Soviet]] tanks.</p>
<p>For, while limited supplies of food are available, the refusal of the fathers to work means starvation both for young and old and [[death]] for the weakest. Indeed, the youngest and the oldest and the infirm, deprived of the minimum food they need and of the medical attention that goes in the first place to the wounded freedom fighters, are dying in greater numbers than in more normal times. These [[death]]s, like the [[death]]s resulting from the actual fighting, are the logical consequences of the decision taken by the whole nation to carry on the fight.</p>
<p>The general strike through which this fight is now carried on is a murderous weapon both for those who use it and for those against whom it is directed. For the Kadar Government, supported only by [[Soviet]] tanks, is being [[kill]]ed as effectively as if each of its members were strung up from a lamp-post. The people taking part in this strike realise full well that what they are doing is madness, that they are not harming the [[Russia]]ns by their strike but only themselves. Yet there is method in their madness. They cannot believe that the West will stand by and witness passively the slow suicide of a whole nation.</p>

<p>Things had already gone rather far, further than we knew, and Gero's visit to Yugoslavia and our joint declaration could no longer help. People in [[Hungary]] were absolutely against the Stalinist elements still in power; they asked for their removal and a turn to the road of democratization. When the Hungarian delegation headed by Gero returned to their country, Gero found himself in a difficult position and again showed his previous face. He called those hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, who at that time were still demonstrating, a gang and insulted almost the whole nation. Imagine how blind he was, what kind of a leader he was! At such a critical moment, when everything boils and when the whole nation is discontented, he dares to call that nation a gang, among whom a great number, and perhaps a majority were communists and young people. This was enough to blow up the powder-keg. Conflicts took place.</p>
<p>The point now is not to examine who fired the farst shot. Gero called the army. It was a fatal mistake to call [[Soviet]] troops at the time when demonstrations were still going on. To call upon troops of another country to give lessons to the people of one's own country, even if shooting takes place, is a great mistake. This made the people even more furious and this is how a spontaneous uprising came about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The experience of Yugoslavia appears to testify that national Communism is incapable of transcending the boundaries of Communism as such, that is, to institute the kind of reforms that would gradually transform and lead Communism to freedom. That experience seems to indicate that national Communism can merely break from Moscow and, in its own national tempo and way, construct essentially the identical Communist system. Nothing would be more erroneous, however, than to consider these experiences of Yugoslavia applicable to all countries of [[Eastern]] [[Europe]].</p>
<p>The resistance of the leaders encouraged and stimulated the resistance of the masses. In Yugoslavia, therefore, the entire process was led and carefully controlled from above, and tendencies to go farther - to democracy - were relatively weak. If its [[revolution]]ary past was an asset to Yugoslavia while she was fighting for independence from Moscow, it became an obstacle as soon as it became necessary to move forward - to political freedom.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia supported this discontent as long as it was conducted by the Communist leaders, but turned against it - as in [[Hungary]] - as soon as it went further. Therefore, Yugoslavia abstained in the [[United]] Nations Security Council on the question of [[Soviet]] intervention in [[Hungary]]. This revealed that Yugoslav national Communism was unable in its foreign policy to depart from its narrow ideological and bureaucratic class interests, and that, furthermore, it was ready to yield even those principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs on which all its successes in the struggle with Moscow had been based.</p>
<p>The Communist regimes of the East [[Europe]]an countries must either begin to break away from Moscow, or else they will become even more dependent. None of the countries - not even Yugoslavia - will be able to avert this choice. In no case can the mass movement be halted, whether if follows the Yugoslav-Polish pattern, that of [[Hungary]], or some new pattern which combines the two.</p>
<p>Despite the [[Soviet]] repression in [[Hungary]], Moscow can only slow down the processes of change; it cannot stop them in the long run. The crisis is not only between the USSR and ifs neighbors, but within the Communist.</p>

<h4>(30) Raymond Aron, article in <em>Demain</em> (22nd [[November]], [[1956]])</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>There are circumstances in political life when discreet expression becomes intolerable. One feels the need to say all one has to say, or rather to cry out one's feelings and one's thoughts. Far from feeling ashamed of the emotions that affect us, we would be angry with ourselves not to feel them. Even if, when some time has elapsed, we can look at things with a clearer head and we put the merits and blame on other shoulders, we will never regret that today's judgment was clearly defined.</p>
<p>In the course of the first few days of [[November]] we reached the depths of political despair. The fact that [[France]] and England were accused by all the nations of the world whilst [[Soviet]] tanks massacred the people who claimed the right to live in freedom, and that [[Europe]]'s [[protest]] was half smothered and half disqualified by the landings in [[Egypt]], represents an historical disaster, for which we shall feel remorse for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Let us be blunt: everything that we have since learned leaves no doubt in our minds as to the hypocrisy of the [[Russia]]ns when they resolved to repress the rising. The evacuation of Budapest was only a war stratagem and the tanks which left then occupied strategic positions. [[Russia]]n troop movements had begun before the Franco-[[British]] ultimatum ... Yes, but Hungarians coming from Budapest told me: "When we learned of the Franco-[[British]] ultimatum, we knew that we were lost." Throughout the world, millions of people continue to ask themselves: "Would they have dared if ..." This question, even if we do not hesitate over the answer, will torture our con[[[[science]]]]s. I admire those who are not troubled by it.</p>

<p>The undersigned who never harbored unfriendly feelings to the U.S.S.R. and socialism, today consider themselves justified in [[protest]]ing to the [[Soviet]] Government against the use of guns and tanks to suppress the uprising of the Hungarian people and its striving to independence, even taking into account the fact that some reactionary elements, which made appeals on the rebel radio, were involved.</p>
<p>We consider and always will consider that socialism, like freedom, cannot be carried on the point of a bayonet.

<blockquote>
<p>Khrushchev's secret speech at the XXth Party [[Congress]] caused a political and psychological shock throughout the country. At the Party krai committee I had the opportunity to read the Central Committee information bulletin, which was practically a verbatim report of Khrushchev's words. I fully supported Khrushchev's courageous step. I did not conceal my views and defended them publicly. But I noticed that the reaction of the apparatus to the report was mixed; some people even seemed confused.</p>
<p>I am convinced that [[history]] will never forget Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin's personality cult. It is, of course, true that his secret report to the XXth Party [[Congress]] contained scant analysis and was excessively subjective. To attribute the complex problem of totalitarianism simply to external factors and the evil character of a dictator was a simple and hard-hitting tactic - but it did not reveal the profound roots of this tragedy. Khrushchev's personal political aims were also transparent: by being the first to denounce the personality cult, he shrewdly isolated his closest rivals and antagonists, Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and Voroshilov - who, together with Khrushchev, had been Stalin's closest associates.</p>
<p>True enough. But in terms of [[history]] and 'wider polities' the actual consequences of Khrushchev's political actions were crucial. The criticism of Stalin, who personified the regime, served not only to disclose the gravity of the situation in our society and the perverted character of the political struggle that was taking place within it - it also revealed a lack of basic legitimacy. The criticism morally discredited totalitarianism, arousing hopes for a reform of the system and serving as a strong impetus to new processes in the sphere of politics and economics as well as in the spiritual life of our country. Khrushchev and his supporters must be given full credit for this. Khrushchev must be given credit too for the rehabilitation of thousands of people, and the restoration of the good name of hundreds of thousands of innocent citizens who perished in Stalimst [[prison]]s and camps.</p>
<p>Khrushchev had no intention of analysing systematically the roots of totalitarianism. He was probably not even capable of doing so. And for this very reason the criticism of the personality cult, though rhetorically harsh, was in essence incomplete and confined from the start to well-defined limits. The process of true democratization was nipped in the bud.</p>
<p>Khrushchev's foreign policy was characterized by the same inconsistencies. His active presence in the international political arena, his proposal of peaceful co-existence and his initial attempts at normalizing relations with the leading countries of the capitalist world; the newly defined relations with India, [[Egypt]] and other Third World states; and finally, his attempt to democratize ties with socialist allies - including his decision to mend matters with Yugoslavia - all this was well received both in our country and in the rest of the world and, undoubtedly, helped to improve the international situation.</p>
<p>But at the same time there was the brutal crushing of the Hungarian uprising in [[1956]]; the adventurism that culminated in the [[Cuba]] crisis of [[1962]], when the world was on the brink of a [[nuclear]] disaster; and the quarrel with [[China]], which resulted in a protracted period of antagonism and enmity.</p>
<p>All domestic and foreign policy decisions made at that time undoubtedly reflected not only Khrushchev's personal understanding of the problems and his moods, but also the different political forces that he had to consider. The pressure of Party and [[government]] structures was especially strong, forcing him to manoeuvre and to present this or that measure in a form acceptable to such in[[flu]]ential groups.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The connection between [[Russia]]'s decision to crush the Hungarian [[revolution]] and the Anglo-[[French]] attack in the Middle East is, and will be, keenly debated. What effect did the Anglo-[[French]] attack in Suez have on the [[Soviet]] attitude to [[Hungary]]? Would [[Hungary]] have been crushed if the [[Israel]]i attack on [[Egypt]] had come, say, a month later?</p>
<p>My own answer is that the Anglo-[[French]] attack did in fact play a large part in persuading [[Russia]] to intervene in [[Hungary]] and I believe that had the Anglo-[[French]] ultimatum been sent to [[Egypt]] a month later, [[Hungary]] would be a second [[Poland]] today.</p>
<p>World opinion has always counted for much with the [[Russia]]ns in spite of all appearances to the contrary. They were not keen to appear lone ruthless aggressors and flouters of the authority of the [[United]] Nations and be sermonised by the West from a high pulpit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We do not speak of a Hungarian Revolution. We speak of the Hungarian agony. From the moment when the Communist regime in Budapest fired upon an unarmed crowd and turned its quarrel with the Hungarian people from a political quarrel which if could not win into an armed revolt which, with [[Soviet]] aid, it could not lose, the suppression of the Hungarian resistance was inevitable. The world seemed to feel that it had no choice, short of [[atomic]] war, but to sit back and watch, in horror and disgust, the brutal, methodical destruction of an angry people by overwhelming force and con[[[[science]]]]less treachery.</p>
<p>It is understandable, certainly, that we in the [[United]] [[States]] should feel shamed by our inability to act in this nightmare. Nevertheless, we should not forget, in all the suffering and pain, that we owe the people of [[Hungary]] more than our pity. We owe them also pride and praise. For their defeat has been itself a triumph. Those Hungarian students and workers and women and fighting [[child]]ren have done more to close the future to Communism than armies or diplomats had done before them. They have given more and done more. For what they have done has been to expose the brutal hypocrisy of Communism for all of Asia, all of [[Africa]], all the world to see. So long as men live in any country who remember the murder of [[Hungary]], [[Soviet]] [[Russia]] will never again be able to pose before the world as the benefactor of mankind. The Hungarian dead have torn that mask off. Their fingers hold its tatters in their graves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the boys (Hungarian refugees) I talked to in Vienna, used a particularly imaginative parable: "People say we live behind the Iron Curtain," he said. "This is not quite true. We lived in a tin. As long as a tin is hermetically closed, it's all right. But then during Imre Nagy's first [[Premier]]ship they pierced the tin and let in a little bit of fresh air. You know what happens to a tin when a little fresh air gets into it? ... Everything inside gets rotten." This is true. It is also the complete [[history]] of Communist indoctrination.</p>

<p>We, the undersigned members of the [[British]] Parliamentary Labour party, who in the past have always worked for a better understanding between our two countries, are deeply distressed at the use of [[Soviet]] armed forces in [[Hungary]]. We therefore ask for this opportunity to express our view to [[Soviet]] readers and to put certain questions to you about the events in [[Hungary]].</p>
<p>First of all, your newspaper has portrayed the Hungarian uprising as "counter-[[revolution]]ary." [[May]] we ask exactly what you understand by this expression? Does it include all systems of [[government]] which permit political parties whose programmes are opposed to that of the Communist party? If, for example, the Hungarian people were to choose a [[parliament]]ary system similar to those in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]], would you regard that as counter-[[revolution]]ary?</p>
<p>Secondly, you said on [[November]] 4 that the Government of Imre Nagy "had in fact disintegrated." Did you mean by this that it resigned or that it was overthrown? If it was overthrown with the help to [[Soviet]] arms, does this not amount to [[Soviet]] interference in [[Hungary]]'s internal affairs?</p>
<p>Thirdly, do you consider that the present Government of Janos Kadar enjoys the support of the majority of the Hungarian people? Would if make any difference to your attitude if it did not? We ask this question because on [[November]] 15, according to Budapest radio, Janos Kadar said that his Government hoped to regain the confidence of the people but that we have to take into account the possibility that we may be thoroughly beaten at the elections."</p>
<p>Fourthly, we recall that the [[Soviet]] Union has repeatedly, advocated the right of all countries to remain outside military blocks. Does this right to choose neutrality extend, in your view to members of the [[[[War]]saw]] pact?</p>
<p>Finally, you have said that the Hungarian uprising was planned long in advance by the West and you have in particular blamed Radio Free [[Europe]]. Are you seriously suggesting that masses of Hungarian workers and peasants were led by these means into organising mass strikes aimed at restoring the power of feudal landlords and capitalists?</p>
