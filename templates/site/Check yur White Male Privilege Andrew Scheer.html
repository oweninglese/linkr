<p>Today, Conservative leader Andrew Scheer made the shocking statement that 
[[protest]]ors and activists need to “check their privilege” and let people whose 
jobs depend on the railway systems get to work. In this case, it is Scheer who 
needs to check his own privilege. His comments appear to be racially motivated 
as the people occupying the rails in [[Ontario]] are very obviously [[Indigenous]] 
peoples. Scheer’s comments reflect worn out stereotypes about [[Indigenous]] peoples
that are not worth repeating, but are not based on facts. These kinds of 
comments serve only to promote societal division and manufacture hatred towards 
a specific group - [[Indigenous]] peoples. Scheer’s [[white]] male privilege as a top 1%
income earner (according to Statistics [[Canada]]) stand in stark contrast to the 
staggering socio-economic conditions of the majority of First Nations peoples in
[[Canada]]. First Nations have the highest rates of [[poverty]] in the country, the 
lowest [[health]] indicators and the highest rates of suicide in the world. Far from
“privilege”, their under-privilege is a direct result of the violent 
colonization of their territories and the continued oppression of their peoples.</p>
<p>In [[2019]], the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing [[Indigenous]] Women and 
Girls found, as a matter of fact and law, that [[Canada]] is guilty of both historic
and ongoing genocide. Both the Organization of [[America]]n [[States]] and the [[United]] 
Nations expressed deep concern about this finding and officials have offered to 
assist [[Canada]] address this. So, far there has been no urgent action to address 
ongoing acts of genocide against [[Indigenous]] peoples. The rates of [[Indigenous]] 
over-[[incarceration]] continue to sky-rocket with [[Indigenous]] women (less than 2.5% 
of the population) making of 42% of those in federal [[prison]]s. Why? Aside from 
noting many areas of discrimination within the justice system, the Office of the
Correctional Investigator expressed concern that federal corrections seems 
“impervious to change”. </p>
<p>[[Indigenous]] [[child]]ren represent half of all [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care, which even 
federal ministers called a “humanitarian crisis” – yet numbers continue to rise.
The numbers of abused, exploited, disappeared and [[murdered]] [[Indigenous]] women also
continue to rise, despite a National Inquiry drawing national attention to the 
crisis. [[Indigenous]] women and girls are the primary targets of human traffickers 
who are able to exploit them with relative impunity. It should come as no 
surprise to anyone at this point that some First Nations in [[Canada]] have the 
highest suicide rates in the world, even higher than post-conflict countries. 
[[Indigenous]] peoples make up 40-80% of [[homeless]] peoples in [[Canada]] depending on the
region and we all know about the lack of access to clean drinking water that has
plagued some First Nations for decades. </p>
<p>The [[United]] Nations has called on [[Canada]] many times to address its grave human 
rights violations against [[Indigenous]] peoples to no avail. The Inter-[[America]]n 
Commission on Human Rights has made similar recommendations to [[Canada]] to end the
human rights violations. The former [[United]] Nations Special Rapporteur on the 
Rights of [[Indigenous]] peoples James Anaya, wrote in his report on [[Canada]] that the
relationship with [[Indigenous]] peoples was getting worse over time and that “It is
difficult to reconcile [[Canada]]’s well-developed legal framework and general 
prosperity with the human rights problems faced by [[Indigenous]] peoples”. He went 
on to report that “The most jarring manifestation of those human rights problems
is the distressing socioeconomic conditions of [[Indigenous]] peoples in a highly 
developed country.” [[Canada]] is wealthy because it stole the lands and resources 
of [[Indigenous]] peoples, carried out violent acts of genocide to reduce [[Indigenous]]
populations and then constructed a complex set of laws, policies, practices, 
actions and omissions to oppress [[Indigenous]] peoples and clear the lands for 
settlement and extraction.</p>
<p>These actions of solidarity across the country are about more than pipelines – 
they are about the continued genocide of [[Indigenous]] peoples and the failure of 
[[Canada]] to abide by the rule of law in respecting their land rights and their 
right to say no to development. These solidarity actions with the Wet’suwet’en 
Nation are about bringing attention to the ways in which [[Canada]] criminalizes 
[[Indigenous]] peoples for peacefully living, asserting and defending our 
[[sovereignty]] over our lands. While politicians make flowery speeches about 
reconciliation and respecting our rights, when it comes to wanting our lands for
development or extraction, they will send in heavily armed RCMP or military to 
take what they want. That is what these actions are about – the failure of 
federal and provincial [[government]]s to abide by the rule of law – all the laws in
[[Canada]], not just the ones that suit their political or economic needs. </p>
<p>Scheer’s ill-informed comments serve only to cause confusion and apprehension in
the public, instead of offering thoughtful solutions that would bring everyone 
together. His words are shameful and thankfully, don't represent those of most 
[[Canadian]]s. [[Canadian]]s continue to be our strongest allies in seeking justice for 
our peoples as lawyers, teachers, academics, social workers, labourers, unions 
and [[Canadian]]s from all backgrounds continue to stand with [[Indigenous]] peoples at 
solidarity actions all over [[Canada]]. That's what the [[treaty]] relationship is all 
about. We need to work together to find a way to harmonize all laws in [[Canada]] – 
[[Indigenous]], [[Canadian]] and international laws - and restore social justice for all
peoples. We must urgently end genocide against [[Indigenous]] peoples which includes
the ongoing theft of our lands and resources. It also means telling the RCMP to 
stand down. </p>
<p>Reconciliation doesn't manifest at the end of a sniper rifle.</p>
