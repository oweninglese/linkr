<h2>3.1. Introduction</h2>
<h2>US and [[Canadian]] border security measures all too often ignore the</h2>
<h2>concerns of [[North]] [[America]]n [[indigenous]] peoples. In borderlands regions,</h2>
<h2>and especially for affected native populations, border security without</h2>
<h2>cross-border stability and cultural continuity can mean no security at all.</h2>
<h2>A broad observance of the letter and spirit of a little known, yet significant,</h2>
<h2>[[treaty]] negotiated between the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Great]] [[Britain]] in [[1794]]</h2>
<h2>could change this paradigm.</h2>
<h2>[[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]]^2 ([[ABC]]s) enjoy access to the</h2>
<h2>[[United]] [[States]] unrestricted by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),</h2>
<h2>a right stemming from the Jay [[Treaty]] ([[1794]]).^3 An examination of this</h2>
<h2>right, now codified at § 289 of the INA, reveals qualifying [[ABC]]s are</h2>
<h2>entitled to privileges unparalleled by all but [[United]] [[States]] citizens to enter</h2>
<h2>and remain in the US ‘for the purpose of employment, study, retirement,</h2>
<h2>investing, and/or immigration’^4 or any other reason.</h2>
<h2>This chapter outlines the [[history]] and development of the Jay [[Treaty]],</h2>
<h2>the rights of [[ABC]]s today and the scope of [[ABC]] status. It analyses the lack</h2>
<h2>of reciprocity in [[Canada]] and explores the issues of cross-border mobility</h2>
<h2>and commerce. It provides illustrations of these issues through case law,</h2>

<h4>and as applied in the [[Arctic]] region. It concludes by submitting that active</h4>
<h4>engagement of [[indigenous]] communities on cross-border mobility issues is</h4>
<h4>crucial to the ongoing development of sound border security and policy.</h4>
<h2>3.2. History</h2>
<h4>Long before [[Europe]]an contact, travel across what is now the US/[[Canada]]</h4>
<h4>border was an element of daily life for the people of numerous [[North]]</h4>
<h4>[[America]]n [[indigenous]] nations. The international boundary was established</h4>
<h4>by [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the US in the Peace of Paris, which divided [[North]]</h4>
<h4>[[America]] without regard for its [[indigenous]] nations.^5 The [[indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>peoples resented a boundary passing through territory that had been</h4>
<h4>theirs since time immemorial and viewed the newly established border as</h4>
<h4>an infringement on their sovereign rights.</h4>
<h4>In [[1794]], to address issues unresolved by the Peace of Paris or arising</h4>
<h4>thereafter, [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the US negotiated the Jay [[Treaty]]. As part of</h4>
<h4>this [[treaty]], the parties sought to relieve tribal tensions arising from the</h4>
<h4>imposition of the new boundary.^6 In relevant part, Article III of the [[Treaty]]</h4>
<h4>provides:</h4>
<h4>‘It is agreed that it shall at all Times be free to His Majesty’s Subjects,</h4>
<h4>and to the Citizens of the [[United]] [[States]], and also to the [[Indian]]s</h4>
<h4>dwelling on either side of the said Boundary Line freely to pass</h4>
<h4>and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective</h4>
<h4>[[Territories]] and Countries of the Two Parties on the Continent of</h4>
<h4>[[America]] (the Country within the Limits of the Hudson [[Bay]] Company</h4>
<h4>only excepted)...’</h4>
<h4>The Jay [[Treaty]] did not create a new right for the continent’s [[indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>people; rather, it recognised their pre-existing right to move freely</h4>
<h4>across the land.^7 In [[1796]], an explanatory provision was added to the</h4>
<h4>[[treaty]] providing that no further [[treaties]] should derogate from the rights</h4>
<h4>guaranteed by Article III.^8 During the [[War]] of [[1812]], Jay [[Treaty]] rights were</h4>
<h4>suspended. The Supreme Court of the [[United]] [[States]] has held that the [[War]]</h4>
<h4>of [[1812]] abrogated the Jay [[Treaty]] and that, following the war, the [[Treaty]]</h4>
<h4>of Ghent revived the rights of native tribes predating that conflict.^9 ,^10</h4>
<h4>The US continued to recognise the right of [[indigenous]] people to</h4>
<h4>pass across the border freely until enactment of the Immigration Act</h4>
<h4>of [[1924]] (Act of [[1924]]), which provided for only those eligible for</h4>
<h4>citizenship to enter the US.^11 Because [[indigenous]] people were ineligible</h4>

<h4>for citizenship as a result of race-restricted naturalisation laws dating to</h4>
<h4>[[1790]],^12 the Act of [[1924]] barred their entry to the US.^13 Shortly thereafter,</h4>
<h4>the US [[government]] used this as a basis to deport [[ABC]]s who had not</h4>
<h4>registered as aliens or obtained immigrant visas.^14</h4>
<h4>In the [[1927]] McCandless case, an [[ABC]] named Paul Diabo was</h4>
<h4>arrested and ordered deported for entering the US in violation of US</h4>
<h4>immigration laws. He challenged his deportation, based on the Jay</h4>
<h4>[[Treaty]].^15 In defence of its position, the [[government]] argued that the [[War]]</h4>
<h4>of [[1812]] abrogated the Jay [[Treaty]], relying on the general principle that</h4>
<h4>war between nations ends all prior [[treaty]] rights, and those rights are</h4>
<h4>only reborn if a new [[treaty]] provides them.^16 ,^17 On appeal, the Court found</h4>
<h4>in favour of Diabo.^18 It reasoned that [[treaties]] stipulating permanent</h4>
<h4>rights, professing to aim at perpetuity, do not end upon occurrence of</h4>
<h4>war, but are merely suspended until the war ends and revived when</h4>
<h4>peace returns.^19 Because Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] grants the right to</h4>
<h4>freely cross the border in perpetuity, the right is permanent in character;</h4>
<h4>thus, the [[War]] of [[1812]] did not abrogate the Jay [[Treaty]].^20 Further, in [[1815]],</h4>
<h4>the US and [[Great]] [[Britain]] signed the [[Treaty]] of Ghent, which again</h4>
<h4>recognised the [[Indian]]s’ prerogative to move freely across the border,</h4>
<h4>removing any doubt as to the existence of that right.^21</h4>
<h2>3.3. Scope: A Determination based on Racial</h2>
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<h4>[[Congress]] codified the [[Indian]]s’ right of free passage across the border</h4>
<h4>with the Act of 2 [[April]] [[1928]] (Act of [[1928]]):</h4>
<h4>‘[T]he Immigration Act of [[1924]] shall not be construed to apply to</h4>
<h4>the right of [[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]] to pass the borders</h4>
<h4>of the [[United]] [[States]]: Provided, That this right shall not extend to</h4>
<h4>persons whose membership in [[Indian]] tribes or families is created</h4>
<h4>by adoption.’^22</h4>
<h4>This provision remained in effect until [[1952]], when [[Congress]] enacted the</h4>
<h4>INA. INA § 289 modified the language of the Act of [[1928]] by replacing</h4>
<h4>the adoption provision with a bloodline requirement – the only racial</h4>
<h4>metric in US immigration law:</h4>
<h4>‘Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect the right of</h4>
<h4>[[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]] to pass the borders of the [[United]]</h4>

<h6>38 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC</h6>
<h4>[[States]], but such right shall extend only to persons who possess at</h4>
<h4>least 50 per centum of blood of the [[America]]n [[Indian]] race.’^23</h4>
<h4>With no legislative [[history]] on point, the basis for bloodline requirement</h4>
<h4>is unclear, but it is reasonable to assume it stemmed from then recent</h4>
<h4>case law and statutory definitions of ‘[[Indian]]’ outside of the immigration</h4>
<h4>context. In the [[1947]] opinion US ex rel. Goodwin v. Karnuth , a federal</h4>
<h4>district court analysed the term ‘[[Indian]]’.^24 After noting the term was not</h4>
<h4>defined in [[United]] [[States]] Code (USC) sections dealing with immigration,</h4>
<h4>the Court looked to other sections of the Code defining the term. It</h4>
<h4>noted the definition of ‘[[Indian]]’ used in 25 USC Chapter 14, which governs</h4>
<h4>an array of issues pertaining to [[Indian]] peoples and land: ‘The term</h4>
<h4>“[[Indian]]” as used in [this Act] shall include all persons of [[Indian]] descent</h4>
<h4>who are members of any recognized [[Indian]] tribe now under Federal</h4>
<h4>jurisdiction... and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more</h4>
<h4>[[Indian]] blood .’^25</h4>
<h4>The Court then cited the canon of statutory interpretation that</h4>
<h4>‘[[Congress]] may well be supposed to have used language in accordance</h4>
<h4>with the common understanding’,^26 and that ‘[t]he popular or received</h4>
<h4>import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of</h4>
<h4>public laws’.^27</h4>
<h4>Applying this canon, the court determined that ‘the words</h4>
<h4>“[[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]]”, found in [the Act of [[1928]]] must be</h4>
<h4>given a racial [rather than political] connotation.’^28 It then addressed</h4>
<h4>the second clause, which read: ‘Provided, That this right shall not extend</h4>
<h4>to persons whose membership in [[Indian]] tribes or families is created</h4>
<h4>by adoption.’^29 The court reasoned that inclusion of the second clause</h4>
<h4>‘means that such adoption does not make the adoptee an [[America]]n</h4>
<h4>[[Indian]] by “blood”, entitling him to free entry under the first clause. One</h4>
<h4>whom nature has not made an [[America]]n [[Indian]] cannot be made one by</h4>
<h4>adoption in some [[Indian]] tribe or family.’^30</h4>
<h4>This opinion and the statutory definition of ‘[[Indian]]’ interpreted in</h4>
<h4>Goodwin were published after the Act of [[1928]] (which did not contain</h4>
<h4>a blood quantum requirement) and prior to the [[1952]] enactment of the</h4>
<h4>INA (which did). Although there is no definitive legislative [[history]] on</h4>
<h4>the matter, the drafters of INA § 289 likely knew of this reasoning</h4>
<h4>when they removed the adoption language from the Act of [[1928]] and</h4>
<h4>expressly replaced it with the blood quantum requirement. Beyond this,</h4>
<h4>[[Congress]]ional reasoning for retaining the racial basis for [[ABC]] classification</h4>
<h4>remains unclear.^31</h4>

<h2>3.4. [[Canada]]</h2>
<h3>3.4.1. [[indigenous]] groups in [[Canada]]: [[indian]], inuit,</h3>
<h3>Métis and métis</h3>
<h4>Section 35(1) of the [[Canadian]] Constitution names three separate</h4>
<h4>[[indigenous]] cultural groups under the umbrella term ‘[[Aboriginal]]’ for the</h4>
<h4>purposes of [[Canada]]’s constitution:^32 [[Indian]],^33 Inuit and Métis.^34 In this</h4>
<h4>context, the term ‘[[Indian]]’ is therefore used in a distinct way from Inuit</h4>
<h4>and Métis. The question then remains whether the Inuit and Métis</h4>
<h4>peoples are eligible for [[ABC]] status.</h4>
<h4>While the Inuit do not self-identify as [[Indian]]s, and [[Canada]] expressly</h4>
<h4>distinguishes Inuit from [[Indian]]s, as far as the US is concerned, [[Canadian]]-</h4>
<h4>born Inuit are eligible for rights under INA § 289 upon establishment</h4>
<h4>of the requisite blood quantum.^35 ,^36 The US does not rely on [[Canadian]]</h4>
<h4>definitions in deter[[mining]] which groups qualify for the benefits of INA</h4>
<h4>§ 289,^37 and US courts have held that the term ‘[[Indian]]’ includes Inuit.^38</h4>
<h4>An examination of the statutory language introduced both prior to and in</h4>
<h4>the INA indicates a clear intent to broaden the applicability of Jay [[Treaty]]</h4>
<h4>rights beyond only those individuals who are members of [[Indian]] tribes.^39</h4>
<h4>Because Inuit are [[Indian]]s as far as the US [[government]] is concerned, Inuit</h4>
<h4>peoples born in [[Canada]] who possess the bloodline requirement may</h4>
<h4>qualify for [[ABC]] status.</h4>
<h4>Like the Inuit, Métis do not self-identify as [[Indian]]s and are distin-</h4>
<h4>guished as a separate [[indigenous]] group from [[Indian]]s in Section 35 of</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]]’s Constitution.^40 The term ‘métis’ originates from a [[French]]</h4>
<h4>word meaning ‘mixed’ and was historically used in [[Canadian]] [[French]]</h4>
<h4>for persons of mixed ancestry.^41 While ‘métis’ generically denotes mixed</h4>
<h4>[[indigenous]] ancestry,^42 when capitalised, the term refers to a specific</h4>
<h4>population of [[indigenous]] and [[French]]-[[Canadian]] origin which emerged</h4>
<h4>from the marriages which took place in the early 19th century between</h4>
<h4>[[French]]-[[Canadian]] fur [[trade]]rs and local [[indigenous]] people.^43 The Métis</h4>
<h4>maintain a strong and unique identity, with specific criteria dictating</h4>
<h4>membership within the community.^44</h4>
<h4>Meanwhile, the question of whether Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s^45</h4>
<h4>are ‘[[Indian]]s’ under Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]], has long</h4>
<h4>been the subject of legal debate. Section 91(24) is the provision of</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]]’s Constitution through which the federal [[government]] of [[Canada]]</h4>
<h4>derives jurisdiction over the subject matter of ‘[[Indian]]s, and Lands reserved</h4>
<h4>for the [[Indian]]s’.^46 In [[2013]], a Federal Court ruled in Daniels v. [[Canada]]</h4>
<h6>This content downloaded from 192.30.202.8 on Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:25:54 UTC</h6>
<h6>40 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC</h6>
<h4>that both Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s are included as [[Indian]]s ‘within the</h4>
<h4>meaning of the expression “[[Indian]]s and Lands reserved for the [[Indian]]s”</h4>
<h4>contained in s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]].’^47 On 17 [[April]] 2[[014]],</h4>
<h4>the Federal Court of Appeal upheld that decision in part: it ruled that</h4>
<h4>only Métis, and not non-status [[Indian]]s, are included as [[Indian]]s within</h4>
<h4>the meaning of the [[Canadian]] Constitution.^48 But on 14 [[April]] [[2016]], the</h4>
<h4>Supreme Court of [[Canada]] (SCC) unanimously restored the ruling of</h4>
<h4>the Federal trial court, which held both Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s</h4>
<h4>are ‘[[Indian]]s’ for the purpose of section 91(24) of the Constitution</h4>
<h4>Act, [[1867]].^49 In its decision, the Court clarified that the term ‘[[Indian]]’ or</h4>
<h4>‘[[Indian]]s’ in [[Canada]]’s constitutional context has two meanings: ‘a broad</h4>
<h4>meaning, as used in s. 91(24), that includes both Métis and Inuit and</h4>
<h4>can be equated with the term “[[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]]” used in s. 35,</h4>
<h4>and a narrower meaning that distinguishes [[Indian]] bands from other</h4>
<h4>[[Aboriginal]] peoples.’^50</h4>
<h4>The definition of [[ABC]] is contingent only on birth as a [[Canadian]]</h4>
<h4>citizen and satisfaction of the requisite blood quantum. Métis identi-</h4>
<h4>fication alone is insufficient to qualify for [[ABC]] status; an individual must</h4>
<h4>satisfy the bloodline requirement, a matter independent from Métis</h4>
<h4>identity. The same rule applies to métis. For this reason, while the recent</h4>
<h4>ruling of the SCC has significant implications for the rights of Métis and</h4>
<h4>non-status [[Indian]]s in [[Canada]], it has no bearing on their qualifications for</h4>
<h4>[[ABC]] status. Ultimately, for INA § 289, whether individuals are [[Indian]],</h4>
<h4>Inuit, Métis or métis, they will qualify for [[ABC]] status if they were born in</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]] and can satisfy the bloodline requirement.</h4>
<h3>3.4.2. No Reciprocal Right to Enter [[Canada]]</h3>
<h4>The SCC decisions regarding the validity of Jay [[Treaty]] rights have been</h4>
<h4>informed by the fact that the [[Canadian]] Parliament has never enacted</h4>
<h4>enabling legislation required for the Jay [[Treaty]] to have force of law in</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]].^51 ,^52 Thus, the [[Canadian]] [[government]] holds that the Jay [[Treaty]]</h4>
<h4>does not affect the admissibility of US-born [[indigenous]] persons to</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]].^53 Admissibility of all non-citizens to [[Canada]] is governed by the</h4>
<h4>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,^54 which does not incorporate</h4>
<h4>Jay [[Treaty]] rights. The [[Canadian]] Immigration Act states that ‘every person</h4>
<h4>registered as an [[Indian]] under the [[Indian]] Act has the right to enter</h4>
<h4>and remain in [[Canada]] in accordance with this act, and an officer shall</h4>
<h4>allow the person to enter [[Canada]] if satisfied following an examination</h4>
<h4>on their entry that the person is a... registered [[Indian]]’. However, the</h4>
<h4>registration requirements of the [[Indian]] Act have proven difficult, and</h4>

<h6>Jay tREaty aND CRoss-boRDER MobiLity aND sECuRity 41</h6>
<h4>[[Canadian]] courts have declined to broaden its applicability; thus, US-born</h4>
<h4>[[indigenous]] persons are not extended a reciprocal right of entry to [[Canada]]</h4>
<h4>under the Jay [[Treaty]].</h4>
<h4>In [[1956]], the SCC in Francis v. The [[Queen]]^55 unanimously held that</h4>
<h4>a [[treaty]] such as the Jay [[Treaty]] is not enforceable in [[Canada]] without</h4>
<h4>enabling legislation.^56 While [[Canada]] does not recognise a reciprocal</h4>
<h4>right of entry for US-born [[indigenous]] persons, [[Canadian]] courts</h4>
<h4>have recognised and protected an [[aboriginal]] right to freely pass the</h4>
<h4>border.^57 This right is protected by [[Canada]]’s Constitution in Part II of</h4>
<h4>the Constitution Act, [[1982]] (Constitution Act).^58 Section 35(1) of the</h4>
<h4>Constitution Act recognises and affirms ‘the existing [[aboriginal]] and</h4>
<h4>[[treaty]] rights of the [[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]]’.^59 Section 35(2) defines</h4>
<h4>‘[[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]]’ to include the [[Indian]], Inuit and Métis</h4>
<h4>peoples of [[Canada]].^60 While [[Canadian]] courts have declined to recognise</h4>
<h4>Jay [[Treaty]] rights as existing [[treaty]] rights under Section 35, it is within</h4>
<h4>Section 35 that [[Canadian]] courts find authority to recognise existing</h4>
<h4>[[aboriginal]] rights.</h4>
<h4>In [[1990]], the SCC decided R. v. Sparrow , analysing the rights</h4>
<h4>of [[aboriginal]] peoples in light of Section 35.^61 The Court held that</h4>
<h4>Section 35(1) should be given a generous and liberal interpretation in</h4>
<h4>favour of [[aboriginal]] peoples, that the [[government]] cannot extinguish</h4>
<h4>an [[aboriginal]] right without a clear intention to do so, and that the</h4>
<h4>[[government]] may regulate or infringe on such rights only if the inter-</h4>
<h4>ference meets the test for justification laid out by the Court.^62 It established</h4>
<h4>four factors to analysing a claim under Section 35(1): (1) ‘whether an</h4>
<h4>applicant has demonstrated that he or she was acting pursuant to an</h4>
<h4>[[aboriginal]] right’; (2) ‘whether that right was extinguished prior to the</h4>
<h4>enactment of s. 35(1)’; (3) ‘whether that right has been infringed’; and</h4>
<h4>(4) ‘whether that infringement was justified’.^63 This test continues to be</h4>
<h4>employed by the SCC when analysing 35(1) claims.</h4>
<h4>In the [[1996]] case of R. v. Van der Peet, the SCC analysed the</h4>
<h4>substantive rights recognised and affirmed by Section 35(1).^64 The Court</h4>
<h4>described Section 35(1) as ‘the constitutional framework through</h4>
<h4>which the fact that [[aboriginal]]s lived on the land in distinctive societies,</h4>
<h4>with their own practices, customs and traditions, is acknowledged and</h4>
<h4>reconciled with the [[sovereignty]] of the [[Crown]].’^65 The Van der Peet Court</h4>
<h4>articulated a test for identifying [[aboriginal]] rights – the ‘integral to a</h4>
<h4>distinctive culture test’. It directs that ‘in order to be an [[aboriginal]]</h4>
<h4>right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition</h4>
<h4>integral to the distinctive culture of the [[aboriginal]] group claiming the</h4>
<h4>right’.^66 To qualify, the ‘practice, custom or tradition must be of central</h4>

<h6>42 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC</h6>
<h4>significance to the [[aboriginal]] society in question – one of the things which</h4>
<h4>made the culture of the society distinctive’.^67 The Court concluded that</h4>
<h4>[[aboriginal]] rights must be based on those that existed prior to contact</h4>
<h4>with [[Europe]]an society.^68</h4>
<h4>Watt v. Liebelt^69 raised the question of whether ‘it could be contrary</h4>
<h4>to an existing [[Aboriginal]] right of an [[Aboriginal]] people of [[Canada]], as</h4>
<h4>guaranteed in the Constitution, for an [[Aboriginal]] person who is [an</h4>
<h4>[[America]]n citizen], and neither a [[Canadian]] citizen nor registered under</h4>
<h4>the [[Indian]] Act of [[Canada]], to be ordered to depart from [[Canada]] for a</h4>
<h4>crime committed [in [[Canada]]]’.^70 While the Court of Appeal did not</h4>
<h4>ultimately reach a decision on the issue, it quashed the order of deportation</h4>
<h4>and remanded the case for further fact-finding on the tests previously</h4>
<h4>established in Sparrow and Van der Peet.</h4>
<h4>Recently, the case of R. v. Desautel^71 again raised the issue of whether</h4>
<h4>a US-born [[indigenous]] person not resident in [[Canada]] may assert an</h4>
<h4>[[aboriginal]] right to enter [[Canada]], and the court found they could. The</h4>
<h4>appellant was Richard ‘Rick’ Desautel, a member of the US-based Lakes</h4>
<h4>Tribe of the Colville Confederated Tribes (‘Lakes Tribe’) and a resident</h4>
<h4>and citizen of the [[United]] [[States]]. The Lakes Tribe is a successor group of</h4>
<h4>the Sinixt people, whose traditional territory extends both north and</h4>
<h4>south of what is now the US-[[Canada]] border. In [[2016]], Desautel asserted</h4>
<h4>an [[aboriginal]] right to hunt for ceremonial purposes by shooting and</h4>
<h4>[[kill]]ing an elk in traditional Sinixt territory in [[Canada]]. He was charged</h4>
<h4>with hunting without a licence, and hunting big game while not being a</h4>
<h4>resident of [[British]] Columbia, contrary to the Province’s Wildlife Act.^72</h4>
<h4>In his defence before the [[British]] Columbia Provincial Court,</h4>
<h4>Desautel asserted his actions were protected by Section 35. In opposition</h4>
<h4>to Desautel’s claim, the Province argued 1) an [[aboriginal]] group must</h4>
<h4>reside in [[Canada]] to be considered an [[aboriginal]] people protected by</h4>
<h4>Section 35 in [[Canada]], and 2) Desautel’s claimed hunting right is incom-</h4>
<h4>patible with [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]].^73 The court acquitted Desautel of the</h4>
<h4>charges. It found he was exercising an [[aboriginal]] right of the Sinixt/Lake</h4>
<h4>People to which Section 35 protections applied, and that the relevant</h4>
<h4>sections of the Wildlife Act unjustifiably infringe this right.^74 The Province</h4>
<h4>appealed to the [[British]] Columbia Supreme Court,^75 which again found</h4>
<h4>for Desautel.^76 The Province’s subsequent request to appeal the matter to</h4>
<h4>the [[British]] Columbia Court of Appeal (BCCA) was granted, and after</h4>
<h4>considering the arguments of the parties, the court again sided with</h4>
<h4>Desautel.^77 At the deadline for finalising this chapter and forwarding it to</h4>
<h4>its publisher, it is unknown whether the Province will seek leave to appeal</h4>
<h4>the BCCA decision to the Supreme Court of [[Canada]].</h4>

<h4>Another recent case has drawn much-needed public attention to</h4>
<h4>the issue of cross-border mobility for US-born [[indigenous]] persons seeking</h4>
<h4>access to their traditional lands in what is now [[Canada]]. Dr Mique’l</h4>
<h4>Dangeli is a US-born member of Tsimshian Nation. Her people’s</h4>
<h4>traditional territory spans the border between [[Alaska]] (US) and northern</h4>
<h4>[[British]] Columbia ([[Canada]]). As one of the few remaining [[flu]]ent speakers</h4>
<h4>of Sm’algya̱x, the Tsimshian language, she moved to [[Canada]] to teach</h4>
<h4>Sm’algya̱x in her community’s traditional territory, but after ongoing</h4>
<h4>complications with [[Canadian]] immigration, she was forced to leave</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]] after her post-graduate work visa expired.^78 While she was later</h4>
<h4>able to secure the right to work in [[Canada]] through an employment visa</h4>
<h4>based on her status as a professor, she continues her fight for her right to</h4>
<h4>live and work in her traditional territory as an [[indigenous]] person. She</h4>
<h4>has started a petition calling on the [[Canadian]] [[government]] to reciprocate</h4>
<h4>the Jay [[Treaty]], which eloquently states the issue:</h4>
<h4>‘The colonial border between the US and [[Canada]] dissects</h4>
<h4>[[Indigenous]] territories in ways that sever the lifelines between First</h4>
<h4>Nation families, communities, languages and ceremonies. Every</h4>
<h4>year thousands of US-born First Nations people who are [[Indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>to [[Canada]] are denied the ability to live and work in [[Canada]] because</h4>
<h4>the [[government]] refuses to recognize their ancestral rights to do so.</h4>
<h4>Yet through the Jay [[Treaty]], the relatives of these same people who</h4>
<h4>are born in [[Canada]] and have [[Indian]] Status can live and work in the</h4>
<h4>US. How is it possible that the US, with its extreme policies against</h4>
<h4>immigration, honours the rights of [[Indigenous]] peoples regardless</h4>
<h4>of citizenship and [[Canada]] does not?’^79</h4>
<h4>The rights of [[ABC]]s are firmly settled in the US under INA § 289, rooted</h4>

<h4>now the mainland US-[[Canada]] border. As security measures have moved</h4>
<h4>to the forefront of modern concern, the Jay [[Treaty]] has become diminished.</h4>
<h4>In the 21st century, native populations face a variety of cross-border</h4>
<h4>mobility challenges:</h4>
<h4>‘[S]ecurity has meant increased difficulty in pursuing intertribal</h4>
<h4>[[trade]] and exchange, greater obstacles to delivery of social and</h4>
<h4>[[health]] services to tribal members who live across national borders</h4>
<h4>and the attenuation of social and kinship networks... [B]arriers to</h4>
<h4>border mobility undercut efforts to keep alive or re-create cultural</h4>
<h4>traditions and practices that native leaders claim are critically</h4>
<h4>important to the identities and well-being of their members.’^80</h4>
<h4>These concerns transcend the 49th Parallel – they extend across the</h4>
<h4>[[North]]ern Borderlands: along the [[Alaska]] (US)/[[Canada]] border and across</h4>
<h4>the [[Arctic]] region.^81</h4>
<h3>3.5.1. the [[arctic]]</h3>
<h4>The [[Arctic]] region is home to over 500,000 [[indigenous]] peoples^82 spanning</h4>
<h4>40 ethnic groups.^83 The [[Arctic]] settlement area is divided between eight</h4>
<h4>countries: [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]], [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], Norway,</h4>
<h4>Iceland and [[Denmark]].^84 In [[1996]], the [[Arctic]] Council was created ‘with</h4>
<h4>the purpose of advancing circumpolar cooperation. The mandate of the</h4>
<h4>Council is to protect the [[Arctic]] environment and promote the economies</h4>
<h4>and the social and cultural well-being of northern peoples’.^85 The Council</h4>
<h4>consists of the eight above-mentioned [[Arctic]] [[States]], along with six</h4>
<h4>[[Indigenous]] Peoples Organisations representing [[indigenous]] interests,</h4>
<h4>the intent being ‘to engage [[Arctic]] [[indigenous]] peoples in the cooperation</h4>
<h4>in recognition of their right to be consulted in any issues concerning the</h4>
<h4>stewardship of their ancestral homelands’.^86</h4>
<h4>Although those ancestral homelands are now divided by interna-</h4>
<h4>tional boundaries, ‘the [[indigenous]] peoples of the [[Arctic]] view themselves</h4>
<h4>as having a historical existence and identity that is separate and</h4>
<h4>independent of the states now enveloping them’^87 – a claim to [[sovereignty]]</h4>
<h4>at the heart of the Jay [[Treaty]]’s intent. While each distinctive cultural</h4>
<h4>group in the [[Arctic]] has its own unique issues and experiences, one major</h4>
<h4>common challenge faced across these communities is cross-border</h4>
<h4>mobility and the Jay [[Treaty]].</h4>
<h4>It is noted that a Desautel fact pattern could easily arise in the</h4>
<h4>[[Arctic]], where subsistence hunting remains a reality of daily life for many</h4>

<h4>communities. In the most remote areas, the border is still unmarked</h4>
<h4>and a hunting trip across an unmonitored boundary line may only</h4>
<h4>become known to the hunter upon review of their GPS coordinates at</h4>
<h4>the end of the day. A US-born [[indigenous]] person engaged in hunting</h4>
<h4>of migratory species such as caribou, whose migration routes crisscross</h4>
<h4>the border, could easily trigger charges like those currently faced by</h4>
<h4>Desautel should their hunting cross into [[Canada]]. Regardless of who</h4>
<h4>prevails should the Desautel case reach the Supreme Court of [[Canada]], as</h4>
<h4>development in the [[Arctic]] continues to impact natural resources</h4>
<h4>and animal populations, it is only a matter of time before both the US</h4>
<h4>and [[Canada]] begin to monitor hunting and fishing in this region with</h4>
<h4>heightened scrutiny.</h4>
<h4>For brevity, this chapter will focus on exploring the issue of</h4>
<h4>cross-border mobility in the [[Arctic]] as applied to the Inuit, the most</h4>
<h4>northerly of the [[Arctic]] peoples.</h4>
<h3>3.5.2. a Case study: the inuit</h3>
<h4>‘We Eskimo are an international community sharing common</h4>
<h4>language, culture, and a common land along the [[Arctic]] coast of</h4>
<h4>Siberia, [[Alaska]], [[Canada]] and Greenland. Although not a nation-</h4>
<h4>state, as a people, we do constitute a nation.’^88</h4>
<h4>As introduced in Section 3.4.1., the Inuit are not [[Indian]]s; however,</h4>
<h4>they may qualify for [[ABC]] status upon establishment of the requisite</h4>
<h4>bloodline. There are nearly 60,000 individuals who identify as Inuit</h4>
<h4>in [[Canada]],^89 and approximately 15,700 Inuit living in [[Alaska]].^90 A</h4>
<h4>discussion regarding the right of free passage for Inuit is not confined</h4>
<h4>by the borders of the US and [[Canada]]. Inuit traditional lands span across</h4>
<h4>the circumpolar region in the US, [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], Greenland and</h4>
<h4>[[Russia]].^91 In [[1977]], the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) was founded to</h4>
<h4>‘speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine</h4>
<h4>their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way</h4>
<h4>of life’.^92</h4>
<h4>In its first conference that same year, Inuit from [[Canada]], Greenland</h4>
<h4>and the US ([[Alaska]]) discussed this common vision,^93 proposing the</h4>
<h4>right of free travel across traditional Inuit lands of the circumpolar</h4>
<h4>region. The conference presented Resolution 77–13, which ‘call[ed]</h4>
<h4>upon [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Denmark]] to provide for free and</h4>
<h4>unrestricted movement for all Inuit across their [[Arctic]] homeland’.^94</h4>
<h4>Resolution 77–13 was rooted in the rights bestowed by the Jay [[Treaty]],</h4>

<h4>recognised by the Supreme Court of [[Canada]]:</h4>
<h4>WHEREAS, a [[treaty]] negotiated between the [[United]] [[States]] and</h4>
<h4>England provides intercourse and commerce across the U.S./[[Canadian]]</h4>
<h4>border ; and</h4>
<h4>WHEREAS, we Inuit are the [[indigenous]] people of the [[Arctic]] and</h4>
<h4>have freely visited and [[trade]]d back and forth across our homeland</h4>
<h4>for thousands of years, thus establishing our [[aboriginal]] rights to free</h4>

<h4>WHEREAS, the Jay [[Treaty]] between the [[United]] [[States]] and England</h4>
<h4>clearly recognizes and protects our rights to unrestricted intercourse</h4>
<h4>and [[trade]] across the U.S./[[Canadian]] border ; and</h4>
<h4>WHEREAS, these guarantees have never been negotiated with</h4>
<h4>[[Denmark]], and have not been properly established in [[Canada]],</h4>
<h4>resulting in the fact that our circumpolar Inuit community does not</h4>
<h4>enjoy the right of free travel and [[trade]] across the [[Canadian]]/</h4>
<h4>Greenlandic border; and</h4>
<h4>WHEREAS, our [[aboriginal]] rights to travel and [[trade]] freely along the</h4>
<h4>[[Arctic]] coast will be an important factor in the economic growth of</h4>
<h4>our circumpolar community;</h4>
<h4>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the delegates assembled</h4>
<h4>at the first Inuit Circumpolar Conference call upon the Governments</h4>
<h4>of [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Denmark]] to negotiate an</h4>
<h4>agreement that will protect for all Inuit the right to unrestricted</h4>
<h4>[[trade]] and travel as envisaged between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]</h4>
<h4>by the Jay [[Treaty]].^95</h4>
<h4>While the Jay [[Treaty]] originally envisaged unrestricted [[trade]] and travel</h4>
<h4>across the border, the provision relating to [[trade]] was never codified in</h4>
<h4>§ 289 – an array of customs and environ[[mental]] laws govern the transport</h4>
<h4>of goods across the border. The regulations and restrictions imposed by</h4>
<h4>these laws often provide exceptions for the traditions of [[indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>communities; however, these exceptions rarely contemplate cross-border</h4>
<h4>cultures, and may only be asserted by communities on one side of</h4>
<h4>the border. Without Jay [[Treaty]] protection in this regard, cross-border</h4>

<h4>[[indigenous]] cultures would be well-served with a strong proponent in</h4>

<h4>Permanent Participant of the [[Arctic]] Council, but it also holds Special</h4>

<h4>on the Trade of Endangered Species, the World Intellectual Property</h4>
<h4>Organization, the Organization of [[America]]n [[States]], the International</h4>
<h4>Whaling Commission, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the</h4>
<h4>International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).^96 These</h4>
<h4>global connections make the organisation a strong player in developing</h4>
<h4>the [[Arctic]]. As the [[Arctic]] continues to develop, the ICC is an ideal advocate</h4>
<h4>for cross-border policies that recognise and respect the traditional</h4>
<h4>practices of cross-border cultures.</h4>
<h2>3.6. Cross-Border Culture and Commerce</h2>
<h4>Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] states in part ‘[n]o duty of entry shall ever be</h4>
<h4>levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation</h4>
<h4>into the said territories respectively, nor shall the [[Indian]]s passing or</h4>
<h4>repassing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature,</h4>
<h4>pay for the same any import or duty whatever’.^97 However, the US</h4>
<h4>[[government]] does not recognise the continued validity of this provision in</h4>
<h4>the way it has Jay [[Treaty]] rights regarding free passage.^98</h4>
<h4>In US v. Garrow , a [[1937]] US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals</h4>
<h4>case, the court opined that the Jay [[Treaty]], including its duties provision,</h4>
<h4>was abrogated by the [[War]] of [[1812]].^99 The court maintained the [[Treaty]] of</h4>
<h4>Ghent was not self-executing and was not enacted by legislation;</h4>
<h4>therefore, no [[treaty]] right remained for the duties provision.^100 Although</h4>
<h4>statutory exemptions from customs duties had been maintained in</h4>
<h4>various iterations of the Tariff Act, the exemption was deleted in [[1897]].^101</h4>
<h4>No legal basis remained for the [[Treaty]]’s duties provision.</h4>
<h4>Nearly 30 years later, the federal district court in Akins v. Saxbe noted</h4>
<h4>that language granting [[Indian]]s the right to pass with their goods duty free</h4>
<h4>‘was not included in the Tariff Act of [[1897]],^102 and it has not been included</h4>
<h4>in any subsequent tariff act’.^103 It maintained questions of customs duties</h4>
<h4>and importation to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the customs</h4>
<h4>courts.^104 Meanwhile, in [[2001]], the SCC held that there exists no [[aboriginal]]</h4>
<h4>right to transport goods duty free across the US-[[Canada]] border.^105</h4>
<h4>Despite restrictive policies in force today, traditional [[indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>cross-border commerce and culture is well-documented: ‘[a]boriginal</h4>

<h4>economies were vibrant – they produced and [[trade]]d, often over long</h4>
<h4>distances and through elaborate [[trade]] coalitions. Trading relations</h4>
<h4>evolved over millennia... It is a mistake to assume that [[Aboriginal]]</h4>
<h4>peoples and their economies were local, static, subsistence-oriented or</h4>
<h4>unresponsive to opportuni ties for wealth generation.’^106</h4>
<h4>Even if the communities cannot access one another to the extent</h4>
<h4>they once did, their long-standing traditions of cross-border commerce</h4>
<h4>and culture continue to survive despite the US-[[Canada]] border; a boundary</h4>
<h4>line aptly described as a ‘figment of someone else’s imagination’.^107</h4>
<h4>Indeed, ‘[f]rom the [[Indian]] viewpoint, he crosses no boundary line. For</h4>
<h4>him this does not exist.’^108</h4>
<h4>The Blackfeet (US) and Kainai (also known as the Blood or</h4>
<h4>Kainaiwa) ([[Canada]]) provide an illustration of the many tribes whose</h4>
<h4>lands were bifurcated by the drawing of this boundary line, and whose</h4>
<h4>traditional practices are affected by its imposition.^109 ‘Today there is con-</h4>
<h4>siderable intermarriage and contact [between the Blackfeet and Kainai]</h4>
<h4>through social, recreational and religious events... These gatherings</h4>
<h4>form the center of tribal cultural and religious life. Tribal members often</h4>
<h4>[[trade]] animals, meat, berries, roots, herbs, handmade goods and medicine</h4>
<h4>bundles at these events.’^110 However, both ‘[[Canadian]] and [[America]]n</h4>
<h4>customs laws... forbid the import and export of certain plants and animals</h4>
<h4>that are significant in ceremonial life. In addition, these laws require a</h4>
<h4>search of all goods, thereby inhibiting the exercise of tribal culture and</h4>
<h4>religion.’^111 While a customs search may seem a benign inconvenience to</h4>
<h4>a non-[[indigenous]] person, it can be devastating to the integrity of certain</h4>
<h4>sacred items.^112</h4>
<h4>The current debate over eagle feathers, which carry religious</h4>
<h4>significance for many [[indigenous]] cultures, provides an illustration of</h4>
<h4>the competing interests and policies at play. Under the Bald and Golden</h4>
<h4>Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), possession of eagles or eagle parts carries</h4>
<h4>civil and criminal penalties.^113 However, a religious exception to BGEPA</h4>
<h4>allows enrolled members of federally-recognised [[Indian]] tribes to apply</h4>
<h4>for a permit allowing them to possess or take bald or [[gold]]en eagles or</h4>
<h4>their parts.^114 Policies exist to allow members of federally-recognised</h4>
<h4>tribes to travel with eagle parts between the US and [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]]</h4>
<h4>without a permit in certain circumstances,^115 and [[Canadian]]s presenting</h4>
<h4>a Certificate of [[Indian]] Status may travel in and out of the US with</h4>
<h4>eagle parts under similar circumstances.^116 All items are still subject to</h4>
<h4>customs declarations.^117 Because the policy for [[Canadian]]s is restricted</h4>
<h4>to those carrying a Certificate of [[Indian]] Status, it necessarily excludes</h4>
<h4>non-status [[Indian]]s.</h4>

<h4>Outside of ceremonial implications, well-intentioned and important</h4>
<h4>legislation aimed at protecting endangered or threatened wildlife has</h4>
<h4>also created unanticipated economic difficulties for [[indigenous]] [[Canadian]]</h4>
<h4>populations, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) being one</h4>
<h4>example.^118 The MMPA bans the import of marine mammals and marine</h4>
<h4>mammal products into the US.^119 The practical effect is ‘[a]n [[America]]n</h4>
<h4>[[Indian]] or Eskimo living one mile west of the [[Alaska]]n-[[Yukon]] border can</h4>
<h4>sell traditional handicrafts made from seal skin into the “lower 48”, while</h4>
<h4>a [[Canadian]] [[Aboriginal]] person living one mile east of the same border,</h4>
<h4>cannot do so’.^120</h4>
<h4>Another challenge to cross-border mobility for [[ABC]]s is the [[Western]]</h4>
<h4>Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) – a result of the Intelligence Reform</h4>
<h4>and Terrorism Prevention Act of [[2004]] (IRTPA)^121 – which requires</h4>
<h4>US and [[Canadian]] travellers to present a passport or other approved</h4>
<h4>document denoting identity and citizenship when entering the US.^122</h4>
<h4>While WHTI-compliant tribal documents do exist, they are not common,</h4>
<h4>and in their absence, the issue of passports serves as a barrier – particu-</h4>
<h4>larly because [[ABC]] status is not dependent on tribal membership.^123</h4>
<h4>Significant numbers of [[indigenous]] people do not carry US or [[Canadian]]</h4>
<h4>passports, either as a matter of [[sovereignty]] (they consider themselves to</h4>
<h4>be members of their own [[indigenous]] nation, and may choose to carry a</h4>
<h4>tribal passport rather than a US or [[Canadian]] passport) or for practical</h4>
<h4>purposes (it may not be reasonable for a tribal elder living in a remote</h4>
<h4>region to travel to a passport application centre).</h4>
<h4>If WHTI requirements are not modified for [[ABC]]s, their Jay [[Treaty]]</h4>
<h4>right of free passage will remain limited. A non-expiring WHTI-compliant</h4>
<h4>Jay [[Treaty]] Card would remedy this situation. The Jay [[Treaty]] Card could</h4>
<h4>be issued by the Department of Homeland Security upon the applicant</h4>
<h4>evidencing their identity and qualification for the status. The process of</h4>
<h4>documenting as an [[ABC]] is outside the scope of this chapter, but in short,</h4>
<h4>it involves presenting the Department of Homeland Security a host of</h4>
<h4>documentation including long form birth certificates for the applicant,</h4>
<h4>their parents and possibly their grandparents, as well as tribal records</h4>
<h4>that indicate blood quantum.</h4>
<h4>Border security and species protection are the realities of the world</h4>
<h4>we live in, and they will continue to impact [[indigenous]] cross-border</h4>
<h4>commerce and culture. However, it is possible to mitigate adverse effects</h4>
<h4>through recognition of Jay [[Treaty]] principles, encouragement of cross-</h4>
<h4>border relationships and, most importantly, consulting with [[indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>peoples in the development of laws and policies that affect their</h4>
<h4>traditional ways of life.</h4>

<h2>3.7. Conclusion</h2>
<h4>The Jay [[Treaty]]’s provision guarding [[indigenous]] cross-border mobility</h4>
<h4>remains in effect in the US. Meanwhile, [[Canada]] has failed at implement-</h4>
<h4>ing a workable solution to cross-border mobility for US-born [[indigenous]]</h4>
<h4>peoples. [[Canada]] has not developed a workable Jay [[Treaty]] alternative,</h4>
<h4>with the only possible option being the very narrow ‘integral to a distinctive</h4>
<h4>culture test’ set out by the Van der Peet Court – which the [[government]]</h4>
<h4>of [[British]] Columbia has been con[[testing]] relative to its applicability to</h4>
<h4>US-born [[indigenous]] peoples residing in the US, in Desautel.</h4>
<h4>[[Canada]]’s position puts it squarely at odds with Article 36 of the [[United]]</h4>
<h4>Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples, which reads:</h4>
<h4>1. [[Indigenous]] peoples, in particular those divided by international</h4>
<h4>borders, have the right to maintain and develop contacts, relations</h4>
<h4>and cooperation, including activities for spiritual, cultural, political,</h4>
<h4>economic and social purposes, with their own members as well as</h4>
<h4>other peoples across borders.</h4>
<h4>2. [[States]], in consultation and cooperation with [[indigenous]] peoples,</h4>
<h4>shall take effective measures to facilitate the exercise and ensure</h4>
<h4>the implementation of this right.^124</h4>
<h4>A recent development in [[Canada]] may suggest positive progress toward</h4>
<h4>softening resistance to border crossing rights for [[indigenous]] peoples. In</h4>
<h4>[[2016]], the [[Canadian]] Senate’s Committee on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples heard</h4>
<h4>from [[Canadian]] [[government]]al and [[indigenous]] organisations regarding</h4>
<h4>impediments to the maintenance of cultural and family ties between</h4>
<h4>cross-border [[indigenous]] communities. The Committee recommended</h4>
<h4>that the Minister of [[Indigenous]] and [[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]] appoint a</h4>
<h4>special [[representative]] to explore solutions to border crossing challenges</h4>
<h4>faced by [[indigenous]] communities across [[Canada]].^125 The Minister</h4>
<h4>appointed Fred Caron to this position.^126 He was directed to engage with</h4>
<h4>[[indigenous]] communities on border crossing issues and file a fact-finding</h4>
<h4>report on the outcome of his engagement.</h4>
<h4>Caron filed his report, titled Report on First Nation border crossing</h4>
<h4>issues , on 31 [[August]] [[2017]].^127 The report documents myriad cross-border</h4>
<h4>issues experienced by [[indigenous]] communities across [[Canada]] and</h4>
<h4>addresses potential solutions. Out of all the potential solutions raised in</h4>
<h4>the report, [[Canadian]] ratification of the Jay [[Treaty]] constitutes the broadest</h4>
<h4>and most thorough:</h4>
<h4>‘[W]hile there was a belief on the part of some of the First Nation</h4>
<h4>[[representative]]s I met with that the current issues would not exist</h4>

<h4>had [[Canada]] implemented the Jay [[Treaty]], there was also a view that,</h4>
<h4>in order to set the path forward, what is required is a mechanism to</h4>
<h4>recognize inherent and Jay [[Treaty]] rights in a modern context. All</h4>
<h4>who expressed themselves on the subject were of the view that</h4>
<h4>recognition of these rights should be an integral part of the federal</h4>
<h4>[[government]]’s commitment to reconciliation and the recognition of</h4>
<h4>a nation-to-nation relationship. Such recognition, in their view,</h4>
<h4>would honour and respect their identity as [[North]] [[America]]n [[Indian]]s</h4>
<h4>having long-standing historical relationships with [[Canada]] and the</h4>
<h4>US based on historical [[alliance]]s and [[treaties]].’</h4>
<h4>Whether the report results in [[government]] action remains to be seen.</h4>
<h4>Ultimately, until Jay [[Treaty]] rights receive significant rehabilitation in the</h4>
<h4>US and recognition in [[Canada]], the [[Treaty]]’s intent will be met in only a</h4>
<h4>lukewarm fashion, if at all. Further incursions will rapidly diminish its</h4>
<h4>usefulness to the [[indigenous]] peoples it was designed to serve. Ultimately,</h4>
<h4>it is clear that active engagement of [[indigenous]] communities on this</h4>
<h4>issue, by both the US and [[Canadian]] [[government]]s, is crucial.</h4>

25 Goodwin v. Karnuth, 661 (emphasis

further quoted the definition: ‘For the

other [[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Alaska]] shall be
considered [[Indian]]s.’ The court also looked
to 48 U.S.C. § 206, dealing with territories
and insular possessions, which provided a
short and simple definition: ‘[[Indian]]s:
[[Native]]s with one-half or more [[Indian]]
blood.’ Although there is no definitive
legislative or regulatory [[history]] on the
matter, it is reasonable to assume that the
drafters of § 289 relied on this definition.

31 Spruhan, ‘[[Canadian]] [[Indian]] Free Passage
Right’, 314–15. One possibility for
retention of the bloodline requirement
may be the then national policy of [[Indian]]
termination, which began in the [[1940]]s
and was embraced by the Eisenhower
administration from [[1953]]–60. See Ralph
W. Johnson, ‘Fragile Gains: Two Centuries
of [[Canadian]] and [[United]] [[States]] Policy
Toward [[Indian]]s’, [[Washington]] Law Review
66 ([[1991]]): 643, 662. ‘The [[United]] [[States]]
identified assimilation and integration as
the official rationale for the termination
policy, but there is evidence that the
desire to reduce federal expenditures for
[[Indian]] nations was a major motivation for
the termination acts’. Robert T. Coulter,
Termination, [[Native]] Land Law § 8:2
([[2012]] ed.). The bloodline requirement
serves to disqualify many from status as
[[ABC]]s.

44 The two major organisations representing
Métis maintain different criteria for
qualification: The [[Congress]] of [[Aboriginal]]
Peoples [http://www.abo-peoples.org]
defines Métis as ‘individuals who have
[[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] ancestry,
self-identify themselves as Métis and are
accepted by a Métis community as Métis.’
The Métis National Council [http://www.
metisnation.ca] defines Métis as ‘a person
who self-identifies as Métis, is of historic
Métis Nation ancestry, is distinct from
other [[Aboriginal]] peoples and is accepted
by the Métis Nation.’ Library and Archives

45 ‘The definitional contours of ‘non-status
[[Indian]]’ are also imprecise. Status [[Indian]]s
are those who are recognised by the
federal [[government]] as registered under
the [[Indian]] Act, R.S.C. [[1985]], c. I-5.
Non-status [[Indian]]s, on the other hand,
can refer to [[Indian]]s who no longer have
status under the [[Indian]] Act, or to
members of mixed communities who have
never been recognised as [[Indian]]s by the
federal [[government]].’ Daniels v. [[Canada]],

52 In order for a [[treaty]] to have force in
[[Canada]], implementing legislation is
required. [[Canada]]’s status as a dualist state
and the effect that status has on the Jay
[[Treaty]] was made clear in Francis v. The
[[Queen]]. The terms ‘monism’ and ‘dualism’
have been used to describe different types
of domestic legal systems. Oxford
University, The Oxford Guide to Treaties ,
368 (Duncan B. Hollis ed., Oxford
University Press, [[2012]]). In dualist [[States]],
which include [[Canada]] and almost all
other [[British]] Commonwealth [[States]], ‘no
[[treaties]] have the status of law in the
domestic legal system;... all [[treaties]]
require implementing legislation to have
domestic legal force’. By contrast ‘[In]
[m]onist [[States]]... some [[treaties]] have the
status of law in the domestic legal system,
even in the absence of implementing
legislation.’ Oxford Guide to Treaties , 369.
The Supremacy Clause of the US
Constitution establishes the Constitution,
federal statutes, and US Treaties as ‘the
supreme law of the land’. [[United]] [[States]]
Constitution article VI, clause 2.

Revenue, [[2001]] SCC 33, [[[2001]]] 1 S.C.R.

55 Francis v. The [[Queen]]. While the case
involved customs issues rather than the
right of US-born [[Indian]]s to cross in to
[[Canada]], both issues fall under the Jay
[[Treaty]]; therefore, its language is important
and relevant to the admissibility of
US-born [[Indian]]s into [[Canada]].
56 In an interesting side-note, the US/
[[Canada]] border itself was created by [[treaty]]
but never codified by legislation in
[[Canada]]. See Phil Bellfy, ‘The Anishnaabeg

68 R. v. Van der Peet, 550–62. The Court

themselves... Courts must identify
precisely the nature of the claim being
made in deter[[mining]] whether an
[[aboriginal]] claimant has demonstrated the
existence of an [[aboriginal]] right... In order
to be integral a practice, custom or
tradition must be of central significance to
the [[aboriginal]] society in question [it was
one of the things that truly made the
society what it was]... The practices,
customs and traditions which constitute
[[aboriginal]] rights are those which have
continuity with the practices, customs and
traditions that existed prior to contact
[prior to the arrival of [[Europe]]ans in [[North]]
[[America]]]... Courts must approach the
rules of evidence in light of the
evidentiary difficulties inherent in
adjudicating [[aboriginal]] claims... Claims to
[[aboriginal]] rights must be adjudicated on a
specific rather than general basis [must be
specific to the particular [[aboriginal]]
community claiming the right]... For a

<p><code>independent significance to the [[aboriginal]]

The in[[flu]]ence of [[Europe]]an culture will
