<p>CANADA'S INDIAN POLICY HASN'T CHANGED MUCH</p>
<p>AFTER THE EVENTS of the past few weeks in [[Canada]], one thing remains clear: 
[[Canada]]’s [[Indian]] policy hasn’t changed much since its inception. [[Indian]] policy 
has always had two objectives: to obtain [[Indian]] lands and resources and to 
reduce financial obligations to [[Indigenous]] peoples acquired through [[treaties]] or 
other means. Its primary methods were elimination or assimilation of [[Indian]]s.</p>
<p>Colonial [[government]]s had a long [[history]] of scalping bounties to [[kill]] specific 
groups of [[Indigenous]] peoples, using small pox blankets to increase [[death]] rates 
from disease and forced sterilizations to reduce the populations. Even 
Confederation did not dispense with the violent colonization of what would now 
become known as [[Canada]]. [[Canada]]’s first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, 
told the House of Commons in [[1882]]: “I have reason to believe that the agents as 
a whole … are doing all they can, by refusing food until the [[Indian]]s are on the 
verge of starvation, to reduce the expense.” [[Canada]] was fully engaged in 
clearing the lands, by any means necessary.</p>

<p>RECONCILIATION: THE GOAL IS THE SAME</p>
<p>Now referred to as [[Indigenous]] reconciliation, the goal is still the same: to 
clear the lands of [[Indigenous]] peoples in order to bolster settlement and 
extraction of resources. This singular focus formed the basis of the violent 
colonization of [[Indigenous]] lands and peoples and, ultimately, is why [[Canada]] has 
been accused of genocide by the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered 
[[Indigenous]] Women and Girls. [[Canada]]’s complex set of laws, policies, practices, 
actions and omissions have created an infrastructure of [[violence]] toward 
[[Indigenous]] peoples and the continued dispossession of their lands.</p>
<p>This is at the heart of the devastating socio-economic conditions of many 
[[Indigenous]] peoples today, including multiple [[health]] crises such as diabetes, 
heart disease and strokes, lower life spans, higher rates of [[mental]] illness and 
some of the highest suicide rates in the world. These genocidal policies also 
serve to remove [[Indigenous]] peoples from their lands through high [[foster]] care 
rates, [[kill]]ings and disappearances of [[Indigenous]] women and girls and the 
skyrocketing [[incarceration]] rates.</p>

<p>Genocide in [[Canada]]</p>
<p>APOLOGIES VERSUS LAND BACK</p>
<p>Despite carefully worded apologies and promises of a better relationship, none 
of these conditions has changed and, in fact, most are getting worse. Add to 
this that First Nations have less than 0.02 per cent of all their lands left – 
mostly in tiny reserves controlled by the federal [[government]]. Political rhetoric
about supporting [[Indigenous]] self-determination means very little when we are 
denied access to our lands and resources.</p>
<p>We need to be honest about what is going on. There never was any real intention 
of recognizing [[Indigenous]] land rights – whether under [[Indigenous]] laws, Section 
35 [[aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] right protections in the Constitution Act, [[1982]], or by 
implementing the [[United]] Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples.
It has been painfully clear, at every flashpoint in [[Canada]]’s [[history]], that it is
willing to starve [[Indigenous]] peoples into submission or im[[prison]] them to access 
their lands.</p>
<p>This is at the heart of what is happening across [[Canada]] over the past few weeks.
The Wet’suwet’en Nation, as represented by their traditional [[government]], acting 
on Wet’suwet’en laws and decision-making protocols, have said no to pipelines on
their traditional territory. While five of the six band councils within the 
Nation have allegedly agreed to the pipeline, their jurisdiction extends over 
their reserve lands. It is the hereditary leaders who have the legal 
jurisdiction over their traditional territory, to decide whether the pipeline 
can cross their pristine forests and rivers.</p>

<p>CANADA BREACHS ITS OWN "RULE OF LAW"</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of [[Canada]] had already acknowledged in the Delgamuukw case that
these were the proper [[representative]]s to bring a claim of [[aboriginal]] title. 
Eight of these leaders have said no to the pipeline. Despite this, the RCMP 
invaded their territory and forcibly removed them from their lands – counter to 
Wet’suwet’en law, [[Canadian]] law and international law. UNDRIP, which is now 
implemented in [[British]] Columbia, prevents the forced removal of [[Indigenous]] 
peoples from their lands. This flagrant breach of [[Canada]]’s own rule of law is 
why the peaceful solidarity actions started all over [[Canada]].</p>

<p>This is also why these actions will continue. Every time law enforcement is sent
in to the clear the lands of the “[[Indian]]s” to make way for pipelines and 
extraction of resources, you will see more and more [[Indigenous]] nations and 
[[Canadian]] allies stand against this injustice.</p>
<p>The real issue has always been about the land. The way forward is recognition of
our right to be self-deter[[mining]] over our own lands and resources.</p>
<p>Anything less is just the same old [[Indian]] policy that invites more uncertainty 
and social conflict. [[Canada]] can do better. It’s time to move past genocide and 
work toward respect for [[Indigenous]] land rights.</p>
