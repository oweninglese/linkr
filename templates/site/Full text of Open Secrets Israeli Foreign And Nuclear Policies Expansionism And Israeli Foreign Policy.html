<p>Foreword by Christopher Hitchens </p>
<p>I should like to begin — very probably to the ire of the author of 
these pages — by introducing the writer as well as the subject. Dr 
[[Israel]] Shahak has been for many decades a beloved guide, in the 
superior sense of that term, to the city of Jerusalem, to the culture 
of a multi-historical Palestine, to the politics of a multi-national 
state and to the archaeology of a multi-layered civilization. I am 
only one of many writers and visitors to have drawn upon an 
immense and uncovenanted reward, merely by acquaintance with 
aman who has decided to act and to live and to think as if we already 
dwelt in a reasoned community. </p>
<p>One can summarize the biographical headings without capturing 
the point. Nevertheless — born in the doomed [[Eastern]] [[Europe]]an 
diaspora, unlucky by the obverse of what Helmut Kohl so crassly 
called (of his own complacent case) ‘the grace of late birth’. 
Condemned as a boy to witness the clearance and then the 
destruction of his people and much of his family. Embracing 
Palestine as a refuge and home, and then deciding (by degrees, 
naturally) that the entire answer to the ancient conundrum of 
racialism and bigotry and fanaticism had not been discovered by 
the messianic. I think we can already see the difference between 
this kind of ‘multi’ and the soft-centred and innocuous versions 
that are so freely offered by those in the West who fear only 
intolerance and ‘insensitivity’ and who, under this sanitizing rubric, 
promote the phoney rhetoric of consensus. </p>
<p>On occasion, when I have telephoned him to discover the latest 
developments within [[Israel]]i society, Shahak has unaffectedly said, 
“There are encouraging signs of polarization’. For most of our 
domesticated intellectuals, such a statement is absurd on its face. 
What, after all, can be more desirable than consensus? Yet Shahak, 
in his lonely analysis, has accomplished a synthesis that will forever 
mystify and evade our practitioners of pseudo-realism and ‘accord’. 
Some decades ago, he foresaw a gruesome unity between the ultra- 
nationalists (who had been mostly secular) and the ultra-clerical 
(who had been mostly indifferent to the project of territorial 
acquisition). Now, for those [[Israel]]i Jews who seek an 
accommodation with their Palestinian Arab neighbours, and for 
those [[Israel]]i Jews who do not wish to live in a fully theocratic state, </p>
<p>1X </p>
<p>” OPEN ‘SECRETS </p>
<p>the alarm has begun to toll. Those who desire an Arab-free land, 
and those who wish for an exclusive and rabbinically-determined 
culture for Jews, have made common cause. The prophet of this 
confrontation (I trust he will overlook the first of these expressions) 
is Dr Shahak. And this explains the hatred which he attracts from 
the certified peaceniks. Shall I soon forget an evening in [[Washington]] 
DC, not long after the disaster and atrocity of [[Lebanon]] in the 
summer of [[1982]]? A gathering of anxious and well-meaning liberals 
had been assembled, to hear General Matti Peled. As a uniformed 
figure, he was naturally considered acceptable and impregnable. 
He uttered some ‘Peace Now’ platitudes and consoled the audience. 
And then I asked him about Shahak’s interpretation and he became 
contorted with rage: ‘Madman ... delinquent ... extremist ...”. Here 
was the ticket to the status of OK dissident. (And now I ask myself: 
Whatever did happen to Matti, the one-time hero of Gaza and 
darling of the peace-loving diaspora?) </p>
<p>The following pages do not answer that now-irrelevant question. 
What the following pages do is to show a mind at work. And also 
a society at work — that [[Israel]]i Jewish society that is so seldom 
scrutinized in the West. In order to explain the reluctance or 
incapacity of our mainstream gurus to spend any time on this 
topic, we might have to postulate the hitherto unthinkable, the self- 
hating Gentile. How else to explain the refusal to engage with the 
way the [[Israel]]i elite actually thinks? The late I. F. Stone once said 
that it was easier to publish criticism of Zionism in the [[Israel]]i press 
than in the [[America]]n. He didn’t guess the half of it. In the public 
prints, in official reports and in semi-official interviews, the [[mental]]ity 
of the ruling order gradually discloses itself. Very often, even if only 
because it must seek justification, the disclosure is authentic and 
requires a certain integrity. And Dr Shahak is there, at the elbow 
or the shoulder, keeping notes and taking names. Possibly you desire 
to know the real nature of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] doctrine. Then turn to 
page 37. In the case of a war with Syria, which city north of 
Damascus would first be obliterated? See page 76. Does it matter 
what Ariel Sharon thinks about [[Israel]] as a regional superpower? 
Don’t make your mind up until you have scanned page 32 (I might 
add that these were written with unusual pre[[[[science]]]] at a time 
when many Panglossians believed that the Sharon factor was a thing 
of the past.) Have you ever heard yourself uttering the cretinous 
liberal mantra ‘Think globally, act locally’? Read on, if you wish 
to understand how a truly serious regime will put such a slogan 
into reverse. </p>
<p>Shahak was unusual if not unique in his criticism of the ‘Oslo 
accords’ because he understood at once that the agreement was 
not local. It was, instead, a holding action, designed to keep the 
Palestinians in baulk while trumpeting a settlement as the admission </p>
<p>FOREWORD x1 </p>
<p>card for international acceptance. In an especially luminous passage, 
he shows how the degraded Arafat dialectic operated even to the 
disadvantage of his Labor Party sponsors. Rendered effectually 
impotent by the ‘accords’, the great leader had no currency except 
the rhetoric of religious redemption. And in his fervid but empty 
periods about holy Jerusalem, he was able to frighten [[Israel]]i voters 
without threatening them, and thus to help consummate the return 
of the Jabotinsky/Stern faction — though this time draped in a 
haredi garb. By seeing this without sentiment, and by s[[corn]]ing those 
who had helped bring it to pass, Shahak earned again the right to 
sound the alarm against those who would coerce Jews in the 
analogous way. There is quite literally no other critic or 
commentator who can claim this non-sectarian privilege. </p>
<p>Those who will murder and repress Arabs for the sake of a pure 
land will also murder and repress Jews. This has already been 
proved, and proved at the expense not just of [[Israel]]i peace-marchers 
but even at the expense of a master of cynical statecraft like Yitzhak 
Rabin. Nobody warned of this contingency, to my Knowledge, 
except Yehoshua Leibowicz — then editor of the Encyclopaedia 
Hebraica — and [[Israel]] Shahak. For Shahak in particular, the past is 
not another country but potentially the same one writ large. In his 
considered view, the emancipation of the Jews by the Enlightenment 
was not merely their emancipation from Christian anti-Semitism, 
it was also their [[liberation]] from a ghetto priesthood and from 
imposed scriptural control. Viewed through this optic, the 
reassertion of Orthodoxy is retrograde for Jews and calamitous for 
those non-Jews who might get in the way (by, say, chancing to live 
in the wrong place) of their heaven-determined project. </p>
<p>If I have a criticism of these pages (and I have several) it would 
be this: the strict insistence upon certifiable truth sometimes 
overlooks the ironies. Thus, Shahak tells us a good deal about the 
sordid errand-boy tasks performed by [[Israel]] for its [[America]]n 
patron, everywhere from Zaire to El Salvador. But was not Zionism 
supposed to free the Jews from dependence upon the goyim? Again 
itis often said, and not entirely without evidence, that [[Israel]] is ‘the 
only democracy in the Middle East’. How does this boast actually 
work upon the [[mental]]ity of those who operate censorship, carry 
out beatings and curfews, enforce ‘emergency laws’ and preserve 
official secrecy? Our author is often sarcastic at the expense of such 
procedures. He was one of the very first to suggest, by a very 
intricate and exact process of induction from available evidence, 
that there must have been something more than negligence involved 
in the extraordinary laxity of Shabak, the over-praised security 
services, during the last rally attended by Prime Minister Rabin. 
But one would like to learn still more of those who, so to speak, 
‘live the contradiction’. </p>
<p>Xl OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Perhaps I am asking too much. In a fine essay on religio-racial 
state ideology, Shahak drives home the elementary point that 
people with a decided world-view very often actually mean what they 
say. For tenderly-nurtured [[New]] York liberals, it might come as a 
bit of a shock that [[America]]n cash is raised, tax-deductibly at that, 
so that Jewish-only roads may be built to connect Jewish-only 
towns. Any irony here will be at the expense of those who do not 
choose to see it. Mr Shimon Peres, the beau ideal of those liberal 
[[New]] York congregations, allows modestly but furtively that, yes, 
it was indeed he who ‘fathered’ the [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] programme. But 
will he still claim the credit when Dimona turns into Chernobyl? 
Or when it is used as the threat for another ‘Masada’? The logic 
of politics is pitiless — else why does Mr Peres even as I write look 
like a dog being washed? And why does Mr Arafat, the harried 
municipal underling of their agreement, look more and more like 
the Grand Mufti — a title which needs the word ‘grand’ to cover 
its nudity and its reminiscence of the servile role of the ancient 
Palestinian ‘notable’? </p>
<p>Shahak can afford to speak as he finds, because he long ago 
discerned that revealed religion is man-made. In this book, you will 
have the pleasure of reading an equal-opportunity sceptic: disdainful 
alike of the supernatural claims of Maronites, Muslims, Druze 
and Orthodox of all stripes, shades and beard-lengths. Much 
depends upon the outcome of his critique and his honest inquiry. 
He may be seen as the outcrop of a secular and assimilated past, 
of the sort which gave Jewish genius its greatest efflorescence in 
the work of Marx and Freud and Einstein, and of those who grew 
up to criticize them in their turn. He may also be viewed as a 
descendant of Spinoza; of free thinking more or less for its own 
sake and of the consolations of philosophy for the isolated individual. 
Such speculations might be designed to embarrass him. It remains 
the case that he has kept alive the candle of reason and humanism, 
in a neighbourhood which always threatens it with the snuff, and 
at a time when this poor candle is all we have. </p>
<p>Preface </p>
<p>Netanyahu and [[Israel]]’s Strategies </p>
<p>In my view the significance of Netanyahu’s political victory, as far 
as [[Israel]]i strategies are concerned, is limited. [[Israel]]i long-range plans 
are decided upon by army generals, intelligence seniors and high 
officials. Ihe [[government]] and the Prime Minister only rarely 
initiate policy. In all wars started by [[Israel]], its [[government]] has been 
informed of decisions to attack when troops were already in position. 
Under such conditions, the [[government]] simply approves the 
decisions made, long before, by others. It is these ‘others’ who I 
mainly quote in this book. </p>
<p>There is much greater agreement on foreign policy among all 
parties, ‘left’ and ‘right’, than is supposed by observers outside [[Israel]]. 
Let me consider the career of Avraham Tamir, now one of the three 
members of the ‘planning committee’ advising Netanyahu on 
strategy. Tamir began in the [[1970]]s as an expert to Labor Chief- 
of-Staff Gur; under Sharon he was chief planner of the [[1982]] 
invasion of [[Lebanon]]; in [[1984]] he became the director general of 
the Prime Minister’s office under Peres; then he joined the ‘left’ 
Meretz party and, in early [[1996]], he joined Likud. Now he advises 
Netanyahu on Syria. Tamir’s career (recorded in the Hebrew 
press) reveals a stability of strategic aims. </p>
<p>By comparison, phrases are of very limited significance. 
Netanyahu once said that Arafat was ‘worse than Hitler’ (Orna 
Kadosh, Maariv, 26 [[March]] [[1993]]). On 3 [[October]] [[1996]], Avinoam 
Bar Yosef reported in the same paper that Netanyahu told Arafat: 
‘you are my partner and friend’. One may be sure that the principles 
of [[Israel]]i strategy, reported in this book, have not altered because 
of such changes in mere phraseology. </p>
<p>[[Israel]] Shahak 
Jerusalem, [[October]] [[1996]] </p>
<p>Xill </p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>I know that many books have been published in English about [[Israel]] 
and its policies. J also know that many books have been published 
in English about Arab-[[Israel]]i conflict. Omitting the merely 
apologetic presentations of [[Israel]] and its policies among them, to 
which I will not refer, there are in my view a number of systematic 
errors prevalent in most of those books (or at least in those I have 
seen). It is my intention to begin a process of rectification of those 
errors. However, instead of criticizing my predecessors I will try 
to explain what I am trying to do, and thus, I hope, the novelty of 
my approach will be apparent. </p>
<p>I would like to explain here the general assumptions (to be 
illustrated in the book itself) on which my approach 1s based. I think 
that the aims of the State of [[Israel]] (and its predecessor the Zionist 
Movement) at any given period of time have to be understood 
according to what the [[Israel]]i leaders say to their followers, and now 
especially by what they say to the [[Israel]]i Jewish elite. They cannot 
be understood according to what they they say to the outside world. 
The official declarations of any state are often intended to deceive, 
but the leaders of any state with relatively free elections must say 
what their real intentions are, to their followers, or to serious 
commentators of the press (who are mainly in general agreement 
with the establishment). This tendency must be especially strong 
in a state (like [[Israel]]) whose army is composed of its own citizens 
and dependent on their willingness to fight. This means that on the 
issues Of [[Israel]]i foreign policy, what is said, especially by [[Israel]]i 
generals or commentators with good connections to those generals, 
to the Hebrew press, will reveal to some extent real [[Israel]]i policies. </p>
<p>In this respect it should be recalled that the strength of the State 
of [[Israel]] resides first of all in its armed forces which are comprised 
of citizens, some of whom (especially if of the upper class) serve 
as volunteers in elite units. It is because it enlists all its Jewish citizens 
in its army that [[Israel]] can manage to employ relatively large forces 
in relation to its population. True, [[Israel]] discriminates against all 
non-Jews, which in practice means against all its Arab citizens, most 
of whom are not called to serve in the Army, and may serve only 
if they volunteer. Nevertheless, the Jewish citizens of [[Israel]] who 
are the majority comprise the Army and [[Israel]]i policies must be </p>
<p>] </p>
<p>2 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>explained to them. [[May]]be some of them only need persuasion via 
the television, but some need more. The [[Israel]]i Jewish elite, who 
take a great interest in politics and also fulfil an enormous role in 
the Army, require serious persuasion — through information, 
explanation and even a debate carried out in the Hebrew press. </p>
<p>The latter stages of the Lebanese [[War]] have shown that when 
[[Israel]]i Jewish society is deeply divided about the political aims of 
the [[Israel]]i [[government]], the [[Israel]]i Army fights badly. Other [[Israel]]i 
wars have shown that when [[Israel]]i Jewish society agrees with the 
political aims of the [[Israel]]i [[government]], the [[Israel]]i Army fights well. 
The invasion of [[Lebanon]] in [[June]] [[1982]] (supported initially by a great 
majority of [[Israel]]i Jews) has illustrated two other important political 
facts. First, it was possible to predict, several months ahead of the 
actual invasion, that [[Israel]] would soon invade [[Lebanon]]: indeed, I 
had predicted the invasion using only information taken from such 
open sources as the Hebrew press. Second, the necessary process 
of convincing [[Israel]]i Jewish society of the need to invade [[Lebanon]], 
carried out quite openly, allowed people, including opponents of 
[[Israel]]i policies, to predict those policies. This is in my view even 
more true now. This is also the reason why this book, which not 
only tries to analyse past [[Israel]]i policies and the principles on 
which they are based, but tries to predict their future trend, opens 
with a chapter describing the nature of the Hebrew press, the 
military censorship imposed on it and the increasingly successful 
ways that the press has developed to struggle against and to 
circumvent the limitations imposed on it. The book is, in many ways, 
a description of the [[Israel]]i Jewish media, and especially of the 
media as a social force. </p>
<p>Although this book deals with the principles on which the policies 
of [[Israel]] are founded, especially as developed in the [[1990]]s, and with 
their probable results, it does not treat them as static but tries to 
describe the constant development of those policies in time. It is 
based on my ‘reports’ about [[Israel]]i policies, as they could be 
understood from the Hebrew press at a given time, which I used 
to send to my friends living outside [[Israel]]. I felt that such reports, 
which I have discontinued, were essential, since my interpretation 
of [[Israel]]i policies, based on what was being said within [[Israel]], was 
radically different from the interpretation of most of the Middle 
[[Eastern]] ‘experts’, especially ‘experts’ of the [[Western]] media. The 
latter, I am inclined to think, base their ‘expertise’ on the official 
declarations about [[Israel]]i intentions as addressed to foreigners. In 
this book, I don’t intend to engage in controversy or fault-finding. 
However, let me emphasize at once that the ‘wish for peace’, so 
often assumed as the [[Israel]]i aim, is not in my view a principle of 
[[Israel]]i policy, while the wish to extend [[Israel]]i domination and </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 3 </p>
<p>in[[flu]]ence is. The confirmation of these assertions will be found in 
this book. </p>
<p>Let me summarize here some principles on which, in my view, 
[[Israel]]i policies are based. In the first place they are regional in their 
extent; their subject is the entire Middle East from Morocco to 
[[Pakistan]], and in addition they have an important global aspect, 
especially prominent in the [[1990]]s. You will find in this book much 
evidence that [[Israel]] is quite involved in [[South]] [[[[Korea]]]], Kenya and 
Estonia, countries which are surely not part of the Middle East! 
However, I consider that [[Israel]]i policies outside the Middle East 
are subordinated to [[Israel]]i regional aims. They can be described 
as having two intertwined aims: hegemony-seeking and the support 
of the ‘stability’ of most of the now-existing regimes in the Middle 
East, with the notable exception of [[Iran]], and (only for a relatively 
short period, now ended) of Iraq. Although [[Israel]]i policies directed 
toward the overthrow of the [[Iran]]ian regime (now a chief [[Israel]]i aim) 
are being justified, especially in the US with claptrap about ‘fighting 
Islamic funda[[mental]]ism’ for the supposed benefit of the West, 
this explanation, tamely accepted by many US ‘experts’, is in my 
view obviously incorrect. First, as is known to everybody who 
follows the Hebrew press, [[Israel]] has for years supported Hamas 
and other Islamic funda[[mental]]ist organizations against the PLO, 
when it thought that such support would serve its interest. Second, 
the most funda[[mental]]ist Islamic state in the Middle East is [[Saudi]] 
[[Arabia]], which [[Israel]], in spite of some frictions, is certainly not 
opposing. Therefore, the real reason for the [[Israel]]i enmity to [[Iran]], 
which may yet lead to an [[Israel]]i assault on it is, in my view, quite 
simple: [[Israel]]’s hegemonic aspirations. A state aspiring to hegemony 
in an area cannot tolerate other strong states in that area. [[Iran]], which 
has defied the US for nearly twenty years, and which may be 
attempting to break the [[Israel]]i monopoly of [[nuclear]] weapons in the 
Middle East, is definitely a strong state. Those hegemonic 
aspirations were also the main reason why [[Israel]] instigated the triple 
[[alliance]] of [[France]], [[Britain]] and [[Israel]] which invaded [[Egypt]] in [[1956]]. 
[[Egypt]] was then in the process of becoming a strong state, too 
strong for [[Israel]]i regional intentions. Everything else is and was just 
propaganda, needed, by the way, not so much for [[Israel]]i domestic 
purposes as for foreign consumption. </p>
<p>It is also apparent now that [[Israel]], especially [[Israel]] latterly ruled 
by Shimon Peres, does not desire just a peaceful economic 
development of the Middle East. After all, Peres is on the record 
in this book, stating that [[Israel]] does not want peace with [[Iran]] 
under any terms. [[Israel]]i policies of ‘coalition building’ against 
[[Iran]], amply documented here in Part II, may yet lead to war, but 
if they do, such a war will be undoubtedly represented for the benefit 
of the [[Western]] media as ‘[[War]] for the Peace of the Middle East’, </p>
<p>4 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>just as the invasion of [[Lebanon]] in [[1982]] was officially called by [[Israel]] 
‘[[War]] for the Peace of Galilee™ </p>
<p>The assumption that the main [[Israel]]i policy is to achieve a 
hegemony over the entire Middle East leads to other conclusions 
unpalatable to the ‘experts’, in this case also to Palestinian and other 
Arab ‘experts’. In the first place it follows that although the 
Palestinians are the first victims of [[Israel]]i policies, and the people 
who have most suffered from them; still, the most important part 
of [[Israel]]i policies is not concerned with the Palestinians. Therefore, 
even a real peace (not to speak about the Oslo Accords, criticized 
here in Part V) between [[Israel]] and the Palestinians will not lead to 
peace in the Middle East. On the contrary, although there 1s an 
[[Israel]]i wish to keep the Palestinians quiet under a form of [[Israel]]i 
control, this control is intended to promote its real policies, for 
example, its wish to topple the [[Iran]]ian regime, more effectually. 
Accordingly, except for an analysis of the Oslo Accords, this book 
will not deal with [[Israel]]i policies towards the Palestinians about 
which much has been written already. It will deal instead with the 
more general problems of what are the [[Israel]]i policies towards all 
the states (not only Arab states) of the Middle East, about which 
very little has been written. </p>
<p>I will give a very recent example, not discussed in this book, as 
an illustration of my reasons for adopting this approach. On 31 
[[January]] [[1996]], Ze’ev Shiff, an important Hebrew press strategic 
commentator, also well-known for his good connections with the 
[[Israel]]i Army and Intelligence, reported from [[Qatar]] in the most 
prestigious Hebrew paper, [[Haaretz]], that the establishment in the 
near future of ‘an [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] umbrella for the Gulf’ is possible 
and is, indeed, supported by some strategists of Kuwait, [[Qatar]] and 
[[Oman]]. Shiff quotes a Kuwaiti strategy expert, Sammy Faraj, who 
came to meet him in [[Qatar]] and told him that provided [[Israel]] 
makes peace with Syria, it should be included in an [[alliance]] which 
‘would secure the peace in the Gulf’ by its [[nuclear]] weapons. The 
reason given by Faraj and tacitly accepted by Shiff for establishing 
such an [[alliance]] is that ‘[[Israel]] is the only state in the Middle East 
which has power for reacting quickly’. Even more important in 
Fara)’s view is the ‘[[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] deterrence’ to be employed for 
securing the peace in the Gulf. Surely those weighty reasons for 
possible developments, should be discussed but, except in the 
Hebrew press, are not — they have very little to do with the 
oppression of the Palestinians by [[Israel]]! Rather, that oppression is 
only the first step toward the establishment of [[Israel]] as the [[nuclear]] 
power in the Gulf; supposedly to secure the Gulf [[States]], really to 
acquire a hegemony over them. </p>
<p>Let me point out again that such [[Israel]]i intervention in the Gulf 
may lead to a war — even a war in which [[nuclear]] weapons will be </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 5 </p>
<p>used — against [[Iran]] from which untold calamities will ensue. 
Although I personally abhor the [[Iran]]ian regime, its nature and its 
crimes, I am of the opinion that an aggressive war against [[Iran]] 
(especially if initiated or organized by [[Israel]]), with the object of 
changing the regime of that country from the outside and by force, 
will make a bad situation much worse, and not only in [[Iran]]. For 
example, I regard the [[death]] sentence issued from [[Iran]] against 
Salman Rushdie as a wicked crime. Nevertheless, assaulting [[Iran]] 
may bring Rushdie’s life into greater danger than at present. The 
[[Iran]]ian regime should be changed only by the [[Iran]]ian people. </p>
<p>Another point follows from this basic assumption. The [[Israel]]i 
aims of establishing a hegemony are totally unconnected with the 
‘corruption of Arab culture’ or other fantastic aims routinely 
attributed to [[Israel]] by so many Arab papers, and with even more 
fantastic aims attributed to [[Israel]] by some Arab intellectuals who 
should know better. However reprehensible, [[Israel]]i aims, which I 
of course oppose, are the ordinary aims of a state which wants to 
increase its power. [[Israel]] is not the first (or the last) state in the 
modern period which has tried to establish a hegemony over an 
area. The characteristic quality of modern hegemonies 1s indifference 
to culture and pursuit of power; the chief aims of modern 
imperialism are profits, especially such as can be acquired by [[trade]] 
carried out on terms favourable to a hegemonic state. Thus, the 
reader will find here in Part III information on the huge [[Israel]]i [[trade]] 
with Arab states which flourished even during the Arab boycott and 
was obviously tolerated or encouraged by some Arab regimes years 
before Oslo. The discussion of this [[trade]] includes a discussion of 
‘[[trade]]’ in [[drugs]], the first of its kind. But there is no discussion of 
‘cultural corruption’ of Arab culture or other favourite inventions 
of Arab press, which in my view are not included in the real aims 
of [[Israel]]i policy. </p>
<p>Finally, something will be said in this book about one of the most 
important means of carrying out the [[Israel]]i hegemonic policies, 
which to my knowledge has not been adequately discussed: namely 
the [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence over the US policies carried out through what 
is called ‘the Jewish lobby’ in the US. While the whole of Part IV 
is dedicated to this topic, this in[[flu]]ence, discussed in the terms of 
the Hebrew press, appears in other sections as well. It may be that 
the Hebrew press exaggerates this issue (although in my view it does 
not exaggerate very much), but its view that rulers of many states 
now court the [[Israel]]i Prime Minister because of his great in[[flu]]ence 
on US policies is, especially under [[Clinton]], surely correct. ([[Clinton]] 
was called recently ‘the real [[Israel]]i Ambassador in [[Washington]]’ by 
an important Hebrew press commentator.) True, this in[[flu]]ence is 
not absolute, but it is very great, and therefore it has to be known 
in detail and discussed. In my view, no better instrument exists than </p>
<p>6 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>the Hebrew press, which devotes much space to this issue, for 
knowing the extent of [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence over US policies. Let me 
add here an important point, not discussed in this book. [[Israel]] can 
in[[flu]]ence the US not only because of the existence of ‘the Jewish 
lobby’, (helped by Christian funda[[mental]]ists), but also because 
[[Israel]] is, in itself, a strong state. No doubt, a great part of its 
current strength derives from US support, but it can also be argued 
that this support would not have been given in the first place (at 
least in its present size) had [[Israel]] not been strong to begin with. 
Finally, let me say something about what I consider to be the 
‘reasons’ which make [[Israel]] desire to acquire a hegemony in the 
Middle East and, in general, to conduct the policies it actually 
conducts. First, in my view the very act of ‘looking for specific 
reasons’ for political behaviour, in which some modern sociologists 
and pundits of political [[[[science]]]] delight, is a suspicious form of 
activity. It is a return to the modes of operation of the Aristotelian 
[[[[science]]]] which tried to assign a ‘reason’ for everything. In modern 
[[[[science]]]], as it has been since Galileo, scientific laws are generaliza- 
tions (capable of falsification) which have been found to predict 
observations and and have no other ‘reason’ for their validity. 
What is the ‘reason’ for the Law of Gravitation or for the Second 
Law of Thermodynamics? There is no reason except that they 
happen to predict what is actually observed. In the same way, until 
the last few decades of recorded human [[history]] it would be difficult 
to find a state which didn’t desire to expand and increase its power 
and to establish hegemony over as large an area as it could. Even 
now, a great majority of states have this desire, which they disguise 
as ‘establishing peace’ or ‘defending’ it or some other propaganda 
phrase. After all, as Gibbon said, the [[Roma]]ns pretended that they 
established their [[empire]] solely in the aim of self-defence; all other 
[[empire]]s or hegemonic states, west or east, were no better in their 
pretensions. Thus, while I regard it as a proven fact that the aim 
of [[Israel]]i policies is to establish a hegemony over the Middle East, 
if someone asked me why [[Israel]] behaves in this way a part of my 
answer would be that this behaviour is ‘natural’ to all or most states, 
as experience has shown. The question of why such behaviour is 
‘natural’ to most states we must leave until the time when our 
knowledge of human nature is greater. At present we cannot even 
begin to answer it, and therefore, for the purpose of political 
analysis, it is enough if we observe that one can establish, by what 
I regard as the best evidence available, that [[Israel]] behaves as most 
states do as they try to establish a hegemony. It is more important 
to observe that [[Israel]]’s efforts to establish a hegemony are, slowly, 
being crowned with success; its true aims are not suspected, and 
other, fantastic aims are being attributed to it. Who would have </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 7 </p>
<p>anticipated that some Gulf states would desire ‘an [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] 
umbrella for the Gulf’? </p>
<p>But [[Israel]]i policies, especially as they affect the Palestinians also 
have an ideological aspect, discussed in Chapter 14. The [[Israel]]i 
official ideology, openly admitted within the country itself, is widely 
misunderstood outside, since, as in the case of foreign policy, no 
attention is paid to what the [[Israel]]i establishment says to [[Israel]]i Jews 
about its intentions and policies. Briefly, discrimination, amounting 
to a form of apartheid, but one based on religion not on race, is 
inherent in the character of [[Israel]] as ‘a Jewish state’. On this point, 
there exists outside [[Israel]] a grave misunderstanding about its 
policies. [[Israel]] discriminates not only against Arabs, or only against 
Palestinians, as it incorrectly supposed (especially amongst the 
Arabs) outside [[Israel]], but against all non-Jews, including its best 
non-Jewish friends. It follows from that official attitude which 
[[Israel]] tries to inculcate among all its Jewish citizens that [[Israel]] must 
regard even its best non-Jewish friends as its potential enemies. A 
political conclusion follows from that ideological attitude: there exists 
in [[Israel]]i policies a latent (and often a not-so-latent) hostility 
toward its present allies. Thus, the [[Israel]]i claim that its hegemony 
is intended to be exercised for the benefit of the West (by itself an 
absurd claim, if one considers the ‘normal’ behaviour of states) 
cannot possibly be true in the case of a state which officially defines 
itself as ‘a Jewish state’ and, as a point of principle, discriminates 
against all non-Jews. A hegemony exercised by such a state must 
be, much more than a hegemony exercised by the ‘usual’ [[empire]]s, 
solely intended for the benefit of Jews. The pattern of [[Israel]]i rule 
in the Conquered [[Territories]], which, as generally admitted in the 
Hebrew press, was much worse than any imperial rule of the 
twentieth century, supports this idea. It is for this reason that I don’t 
like to discuss [[Israel]]i policies in terms of ‘settler states’, or ‘colonial 
rule’, since I regard [[Israel]]i policies as being much worse than those 
applied by other colonial regimes. It can be further presumed that 
Peres’ ‘[[New]] Middle East’, if established (even under Netanyahu), 
would be a much worse form of hegemonic exploitation of the 
Middle East than those employed by the former imperial regimes. </p>
<p>The only way of avoiding [[Israel]]i hegemony and generally of 
avoiding the increase of [[Israel]]i power in the Middle East (which 
in my view will be also a disaster for [[Israel]]i Jews) is a detailed 
knowledge of [[Israel]]i policies and the way they are presented to the 
[[Israel]]i Jews. Slogan-mongering, or endless quoting of the Balfour 
Declaration only aggravates the situation. As Francis Bacon, one 
of the founders of modern [[[[science]]]] said, ‘Knowledge is power.’ ‘This 
dictum is as valid in politics as in anything else. One can add that 
lack of knowledge is weakness. No political struggle, just or unjust, 
can be waged from a position of wilful weakness. ‘The aim of this </p>
<p>8 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>book is to add detailed knowledge for those, of whatever nation 
(including Jews) who don’t like the prospect of an [[Israel]]i hegemony 
being established over the Middle East. </p>
<p>Note: Since this book was written as a series of individual reports 
a date indicating when each report was written ac[[companies]] the 
title of each chapter. The short prefaces to each chapter were, 
however, written in [[February]] [[1996]]. </p>
<p>A note on the Hebrew press </p>
<p>Since I am constantly quoting the Hebrew newspapers in this 
book, let me say something about each of them. As of [[February]] 
[[1996]], four national Hebrew papers are published in [[Israel]]. All of 
them are ‘quality papers’, avoiding the more lurid forms of sex and 
crime reporting, and publishing (especially on Fridays and the 
eves of Jewish holidays) long and thoughtful articles and interviews 
with the leaders of the state. There are also a host of local Friday 
papers, often of as high a quality as the national papers. The four 
national Hebrew papers are discussed below. </p>
<p>[[Haaretz]] (“The Land’) — Regarded as the most prestigious, serious 
and informative of the Hebrew papers, it is, for those very reasons, 
read only by the [[Israel]]i Jewish elite and has a more or less steady 
circulation. It used to support the views of the [[Israel]]i centre, and 
as such was more moderate than other papers, but lately it has 
tended to support (critically, however) the views of the two left 
Zionist parties: Labor and Meretz (‘Energy’). Because it employs 
good journalists having good connections with the [[government]] in 
power, its news and views must be treated seriously. On the other 
hand, for that very reason and because of its unbridled support for 
the [[Israel]]i economic elite, its views must be ‘corrected’ by the 
other papers. [[Haaretz]] is owned and published by the Schoken 
family. </p>
<p>Davar (‘Matter’) — For years Davar had been the official paper 
of the [[Israel]]i [[trade]] union movement (the Histadrut) and really of 
the [[Israel]]i Labor party. It was, quite justifiably, regarded as dull, 
but became more open to other views than it used be. However, 
its circulation declined all the time, and it finally ceased publication 
in [[March]] [[1996]]. </p>
<p>Yediot Ahronot (‘Last [[New]]s’) — The paper with the largest 
circulation, Yediot Ahronot sells more copies than all the other 
papers together. It tends to include all views in the framework of 
Zionism. Back in the late [[1960]]s it was the first Hebrew paper to 
publish articles seriously critical of the [[Israel]]i establishment and 
its “sacred cows’, and not only on issues of human rights (which 
all papers published). For example, before [[October]] [[1973]] it not only </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION 9 </p>
<p>published articles by radical writers which predicted the [[War]] and 
put the blame for its outbreak on the [[Israel]]i [[government]], but also 
published articles (by Boaz Evron) in which the Holocaust appeared 
as a part of a more general Nazi plan to colonize [[Europe]], especially 
eastern [[Europe]], directed against [[Israel]]i Jewish dogma that Nazism 
was uniquely anti-Jewish. I consider it the best Hebrew paper 
which appears now. </p>
<p>Maariv (‘Evening tide’) — The second largest Hebrew paper, 
Maanv originally tended to support the right-wing parties, but now 
its position is not very different from that of Yediot Ahronot. It is 
especially prominent in its critique of the Army, including past [[Israel]]i 
war crimes. Originally they both were evening papers and are 
sometimes referred to as such, but for a long time both have 
appeared in the early morning like the other papers. They still retain, 
however, a more popular character, treating traffic incidents or 
crimes of sensational nature at great length. At the same time they 
devote much space to serious information and political debate, and 
(especially on Fridays) to the discussion of cultural issues. </p>
<p>The two Hebrew Jerusalem Friday papers which I use, are 
Kol Ha’ (‘All the town’) and Yerushalaim (‘Jerusalem’) The most 
radical of the entire Hebrew press, Kol Ha’iris also the most trendy 
on issues such as modern music and dance, sex, etc. More 
conservative than Kol Ha’ir, Yerushalem js still, on many issues, 
bolder than the national Hebrew press. </p>
<p>In addition to the above I also quote in this book from the 
following newspapers, all of which closed several years ago. </p>
<p>When it appeared Hadashot (‘[[New]]s’) used to be the best Hebrew 
paper, better (especially in the [[1980]]s) than Yediot Ahronot. In the 
long run, however, it showed itself to be too radical for the average 
[[Israel]]i Jewish taste. It concentrated on the very poor and miserable, 
which in my view angered the working class. When it existed I used 
it very much. Ha’olam Ha’ze (‘This World’) was a weekly 
publication. In this book, I quote from a later version of this weekly, 
not the earlier one which was edited by Uri Avneri and 1n my view 
was unworthy of credence until about [[1984]]. The new version, under 
a completely different ownership and editorship was a serious 
weekly which had to stop publication, probably because of the 
competition of the equally serious Friday issues of the dailies. 
Shishi (‘Friday’) was a continuation of Ha’olam Ha’ze under another 
name, which had to stop publication for the same reasons. 
Al Hamishmar (‘On the Watch’) was a daily, lately very boring and 
dogmatic, owned by Mapan, a left Zionist party, and financed by 
a kibbutz movement Ha’kibbutz Ha’Artzi (“The country Kubbutz’), 
affiliated with it. It had a very low circulation and, in my view, was 
of inferior quality. Eventually, the kibbutz movement got tired of 
financing a paper not read even by its own younger members. </p>

<p>CENSORSHIP </p>
<p>The Struggle Against Muilitary 
Censorship and the Quality of the Army 
2 [[December]] [[1992]] </p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>‘This chapter illustrates not only how and to what extent the Hebrew 
press serves as a source of information, but also shows that the 
relative freedom it enjoys in the [[1990]]s represents a great 
improvement on a former situation. Let me add that this 
improvement coincides, and not by chance, with the decline of the 
[[Israel]]i Labor Party, and more generally with the decline of the 
Zionist ‘left’. Contrary to the opinion of most ‘experts’, the Zionist 
‘left’ is more hostile to individual human rights and freedom of 
expression than the main parties (for example, Likud) of the Zionist 
right. (The quasi-bolshevik nature of the old-style Zionist ‘left’ and 
its enmity to freedom for anyone, including Jews, escaped the 
attention of most left-wing [[Western]] writers on [[Israel]] in the [[1950]]s 
and [[1960]]s.) Another important reason for the increase in freedom 
of the press in the last twenty years, as illustrated in this chapter, 
were the unsuccessful (or only half-successful) [[Israel]]i wars. Another 
Important phenomenon illustrated in this chapter 1s the great 
interest taken by readers of the Hebrew press in the Army and 
everything connected with it, and the way in which this interest can 
be used to increase the freedom of the Hebrew press. </p>
<p>A similar phenomenon of an increase of freedom of expression 
following an unsuccessful war occurred in the US, where the actual 
freedom of the press (although still, in my view, lesser in extent 
than in the current Hebrew press) increased greatly after the 
[[Vietnam]]ese [[War]]. Something similar can be observed in other 
countries. </p>
<p>Among the anomalies of [[Israel]]i society none in my view is more 
glaring than the existence of a fairly free expression in the general 
and free press in particular, under a censorship which may well be 
one of the most stringent in the world. This paradox was well 
described by Yitzhak Gal-Nur (Maariv, 25 [[November]] [[1992]]): </p>
<p>13 </p>
<p>14 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>‘Legally, [[[Israel]]i] military censorship 1s all-powerful. In practice only 
a small proportion of press contents are censored in [[Israel]].’ Let me 
first describe the awesome legal powers of censorship: awesome 
enough to forbid the description of these powers until recent days. 
I will next proceed to describe the present struggle against 
accumulation of so much power in the censor’s hand, and the deeper 
reasons for the willing compliance of [[Israel]]i Jewish society with those 
realities and the rarity of [[[[protest]]s]] against them in the past. </p>
<p>Some information 1s needed to clear the ground. Military 
censorship is only one of a number of separately operating 
censorships, some of them abolished only in recent years and 
others still operative. I will not list all of them, contenting myself 
with two examples. There used to be a censorship committee 
concerned with the theatre; no production could be staged without 
its clearance. Before [[1967]] its vigilance was targeted primarily at 
what was thought too sexually explicit or contained sexually explicit 
language in both contemporary and classical plays. After [[1967]], when 
Hebrew theatre became a channel of political [[protest]], the targets 
of the censors shifted to what they would assess (sometimes 
correctly) as anti-patriotic, anti-army or pro-Arab, especially when 
a contemporary play would raise the subject of anti-Palestinian 
atrocities. Several such plays were banned; in several others, whole 
portions were excised. Since theatre is popular among [[Israel]]i 
middle and upper classes, this particular censorship engendered 
outcries of [[protest]]. The [[[[protest]]s]] forced the censors to be increasingly 
careful about their bans. After a struggle, this censorship was 
abolished a few years ago, with the consent of all secular parties 
over the opposition of the religious ones. </p>
<p>Another censorship committee oversees the mail, and is 
empowered to open private letters and to confiscate (but not 
destroy) them. In the [[1950]]s it acted with few restraints, but in recent 
years it has busied itself primarily with confiscating those letters of 
new emigrants from the former USSR to their relatives which 
could deter the latter from immigrating to [[Israel]]. </p>
<p>Of all forms of censorships, however, military censorship has from 
[[Israel]]’s inception been by all means the most important, most all- 
inclusive and most galling. It has been especially so since, as 
Gal-Nur rightly pointed out, ‘in [[Israel]], the underlying principle is 
that all public information is secret, except if it has been authorized 
for publication’, and since ‘the [[government]] can be easily tempted 
to use its powers, for the sake of deterrence or in order to pursue 
some evil schemes’, or simply ‘to conceal the extent of its own 
stupidity or misperformance’. One of the effects is that military 
censorship is actually furthering the Army’s misperformance. Since 
[[1974]] when the struggle against military censorship began in earnest, 
this has been the main and most persuasive argument of its critics </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP jw </p>
<p>and campaigners for its abolition. For the public at large, this 
argument has certainly carried more conviction than any arguments 
about the undesirability of keeping people in the dark about the 
extent of the army’s atrocities. When [[Israel]] Landers (Davar Friday 
Supplement, 27 [[November]] [[1992]]) wants to hit military censorship 
at its softest spot, he recalls how during the week preceding 6 
[[October]] [[1973]], censorship banned all the news derived from usual 
press sources about the massing of [[Egypt]]ian and Syrian troops on 
the cease-fire lines. The [[Israel]]i Army then assessed these troop 
concentrations as devoid of all significance, and therefore didn’t 
want to upset the public unduly. In effect, the ban itself was 
instru[[mental]] in shepherding [[Israel]] to its subsequent defeats. 
Landers admits, however, that the press itself was then willing 
to toe the censorship’s line, out of respect for the Army whose 
prestige stood in [[1967]]-73 at its peak. Formal censorial bans were 
at that time often not needed because ‘friendly advice’ could 
suffice. The now raging campaign against military censorship 
originated from the Army’s clumsy efforts to conceal negligence 
during the [[1992]] ‘I’s’elim exercise in which five soldiers were [[kill]]ed. 
A major factor leading to public outrage over that affair were 
lengthy press interviews with the families of the [[kill]]ed and wounded 
soldiers. Their common theme was the interviewees’ desire to 
know the causes of the accident. But, as Landers observes, this was 
not always so in the past. He recalls the explosion of an army truck 
in Eilat on 24 [[January]] [[1970]]. Against all regulations, the truck was 
loaded with charged mines, [[kill]]ing as many as 24 soldiers, wounding 
even more and destroying parts of the city. ‘No Hebrew paper 
printed a single story about the dead soldiers’ parents’, recalls 
Landers. In the following days some stories did appear about the 
soldiers’ burials, but were relegated to short notes on the inside pages 
of the papers, very much in contrast to what routinely happens now, 
when military burials invariably receive maximum publicity. A 
‘friendly request’ of the censor to the newspapers’ editors then 
sufficed to silence the press without any formal ban. Landers 
quotes from the then published Davar [[editorial]] that ‘when [[Israel]]’s 
very survival is in jeopardy, the occasional occurrence of such 
accidents cannot be avoided.’ Maariv, then the largest circulation 
paper, went even further: ‘Disasters such as in Eilat are bound to 
occur in a war.’ This particular accident could not be hushed up 
totally because it occurred in the midst of a city. In general, 
however, the coverage of accidents involving soldier’s [[death]]s as a 
result of the Army’s negligence was banned until the late [[1970]]s. 
Pictures of wounded [[Israel]]i soldiers in pain, or grumbling because 
of any discomfort, such as were common in the [[America]]n press 
coverage of the [[Vietnam]] [[War]], are still banned in [[Israel]], but pictures 
of wounded soldiers smiling in a comfortable hospital beds are </p>
<p>16 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>encouraged. The [[Lebanon]] [[War]] brought a change in this respect. 
Grumblings and [[[[protest]]s]] of soldiers were allowed to be quoted in 
the media, and even shown on TV. Once the [[warfare]] against the 
Lebanese guerillas turned sour, even anti-war satire was allowed. </p>
<p>Relaxation of military censorship, along with other social changes, 
must be attributed to the [[Israel]]i near-defeat in the [[October]] [[1973]] 
[[War]]. It was this near-defeat which marked the beginning of the 
yearning of [[Israel]]is for more freedom. The transformation of [[Israel]]i 
society in this respect is still under way, yet far from being completed. 
But until that point in time, unquestioning compliance was by and 
large voluntary, compensated, as is common also elsewhere, by 
military triumphs and easy conquests. </p>
<p>Legal documents defining the powers of the military censorship 
committee, including the texts of agreements reached by the so- 
called ‘Editors’ Committee’ with the committee, were published 
for the first time ever by [[Haaretz]] on last 26 [[November]]. They are 
based on the [[British]] ‘Defence Regulations’ of [[1945]], originally 
devised to suppress Jewish underground organizations. Advocate 
Dov Yoseph, subsequently the [[Israel]]i Justice Minister from Labor, 
defined them in [[1946]] as ‘worse than Nazi laws. True, the Nazis 
committed worse atrocities, but they at least did not legislate them.’ 
These laws were adopted by the State of [[Israel]]. Their stipulations 
regarding censorship are still binding (except for strictly nominal 
amendments such as the replacement of ‘His Majesty’ by ‘Defence 
Minister’, or the like). They empower the censor to ban any 
publication considered as ‘possibly jeopardizing the defence of 
[[Israel]], or public peace and order’ without providing any reasons 
for the ban. This applies to any printed matter, from books to 
crosswords, including reprints of what has been already published. 
All periodical publications, except for those which appear in single 
issues, need to be licensed. The censor can also close newspapers, 
and confiscate printing machines, faxes and duplicating machines, 
as was done in the Gaza Strip at the onset of the Intifada. An 
amendment adopted in [[1988]] commands that ‘anything authored 
by anyone which may possibly affect the state’s security in any way’ 
be submitted to preventive censorship. And there are additional 
stipulations, still in force, which bestow on the censor further 
powers that know virtually no limits. </p>
<p>It begs the question how could the Hebrew press function at all 
under such laws, even with all the self-restraint it exercised before 
[[1973]], and certainly after [[1973]] when it was already capable of 
winning some freedoms for itself with increasing success? There 
can be several answers to this. In the first place, the ‘Defence 
Regulations’ were adopted, first by the provisional ‘National 
Council’ in [[1948]], and subsequently by the first Knesset in [[1949]], 
on the understanding, shared by Ben-Gurion who then was both </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP 17 </p>
<p>Prime Minister and Defence Minister, that they were to be applied 
mainly against the Arabs, whereas the Jews were not to be hindered 
by censorship from political debate and criticism of the goverment, 
no matter how truculent. This distinctively [[Israel]]i mixture of 
democracy and [[racism]] was at first informal, because the Labor Party 
was loath to acknowledge openly its [[racism]]. Eventually censorship 
was nevertheless institutionalized, not by law, but in an agreement, 
first signed in [[1951]] and amended in [[1966]], between the military 
censorship and the Editors’ Committee, which represented the bulk 
of the Hebrew press, though no Arab newspaper was included. The 
text of the agreement was kept secret until published recently by 
[[Haaretz]]: ‘1. The sole purpose of the censorship committee is to 
prevent publications of security-related information apt to help the 
enemy or prejudice the defence of [[Israel]]. 2. Censorship will not 
be applied to political arguments, opinions, comments, evaluations 
or any other contents, except when they contain, or can involuntarily 
disclose some security-related information. 3. Censorship is to 
rely on cooperation of the army authorities with the [[[Israel]]i] press 
aiming at meeting the purpose defined in section 1.’ </p>
<p>This statement of principle is followed by detailed specifications 
in regard to forms of the mentioned cooperation, to be discussed 
below. But it needs to be first admitted that the promise of Section 
2 has been fully kept. From the beginning the Hebrew press could 
freely criticize and abuse the [[government]], as well as other politicians. 
And it used its freedom fully, in the [[1950]]s even more than in the 
[[1990]]s. (In the Arabic press the situation was different, in that its 
freedom of expression has been limited. But this matter will not 
be discussed here.) ‘The meaning of the phrase ‘security-related 
information’ was stretched to cover topics whose bearing upon 
security was most tenuous, but comparing the [[Israel]]i Prime Minister 
(or any other politician) even to Hitler has always been allowed in 
the Hebrew press. </p>
<p>‘The remainder of the agreement sets terms of the cooperation 
between the two parties to it, with the aim of ensuring its smooth 
functioning. Its primary tool was to be the Editors’ Committee, 
comprised of the editors of the then existent Hebrew daily 
newspapers and the director of the Broadcasting Authority. In 
sheer numbers there were more daily newspapers in the [[1950]]s than 
now, because every party owned one, in addition to non-party 
newspapers operating on commercial principles. As I recall in the 
mid-[[1950]]s there appeared as many as twelve daily Hebrew 
newspapers, representing the entire spectrum of Zionist political 
parties. </p>
<p>Commenting on the agreement, Dori Klasenbald (‘Voluntary 
agreement to be censored corrupts’, Hadashot, 19 [[November]]) </p>
<p>18 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>stated that it was slanted in favor of censorship. “The worst aspect 
of the agreement under discussion is that it imposes on both the 
newspapers and the censoring bodies an obligation to submit a 
disputed issue to a “censorship committee” comprised of an army 
[[representative]], a newspapers’ [[representative]], and a [[representative]] 
of the public. Much as it may sound incredible, no rulings of this 
committee are binding, unless they are approved by the Chief of 
Staff. On this point, the agreement is very specific. In effect, 
therefore, it delegates the overriding authority to the Chief of Staff, 
which in itself should be a sufficient cause for annulling it ... The 
committee referred to has all the flaws any censorial authority is 
bound to have. It has no clear procedural rules for conducting 
de[[liberation]]s and reaching decisions. Its decisions cannot be 
invoked as binding precedents. Its de[[liberation]]s are secret. If it hears 
an appeal, the very lapse of time between submitting that appeal 
and obtaining a ruling 1s bound to reduce the value of an information 
whose ban is appealed. Finally, the composition of the committee 
is not such as to guarantee qualified and informed decisions needed 
in cases of conflict between the opposite interests of the 
contending sides.’ </p>
<p>But the factual subordination of this committee to the Army was 
not everything. As Klasenbald explains, “The agreement rested on 
the notion that the security of the state was the overriding value, 
compared to which freedom of expression in general and of the press 
in particular was something marginal, a kind of favour the censor 
would agree to render to the press and its readers.’ He concludes 
that ‘the public should not delegate to any “censorship committee” 
the powers to determine how far freedom of the press and the 
public’s right to be informed can go. Delegation of such powers 
to anyone is contrary to the freedom of expression as a whole.’ And 
his final conclusion is that ‘any voluntary agreement with censorship 
corrupts, because it hurts the freedom of expression.’ Moshe Negb1 
(Hadashot, 19 [[November]]) concurs: “The newspapers which signed 
the agreement hoped to operate under comfortable conditions, at 
the cost of imposing hardships on other papers, left vulnerable to 
sanctions permissible under the draconic Mandatory regulations, 
which even entitle the censor to close newspapers, as he actually 
did with the Hadashot eight years ago.’ They won their relative 
freedom at the cost of renouncing their right to appeal to the 
Supreme Court against the censor. </p>
<p>Statements like these by Gal-Nur, Negbi or Klasenbald represent 
in [[Israel]] a novelty. No opinions of this kind have ever been voiced 
by the so-called Zionist left. Zionist parties could, for example, differ 
from each other on whether the Army or the settlement should have 
higher priority, but they were unanimous in prioritizing Zionism 
over human rights, even those designed to accrue to the Jews </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP 19 </p>
<p>alone. The Zionist left has never been an exception in this respect. 
The drive toward freedom of expression as well as toward other 
elementary freedoms, originates in [[Israel]] with the centre of the 
political spectrum, or with some marginal groups, or else with 
some individuals on the non-Zionist left. Their in[[flu]]ence is in my 
view primarily catalytic: effective not by itself but by virtue of 
succeeding in attracting youth and the media to their ideas. This 
explains why military censorship was accepted voluntarily when the 
Zionist left wielded much power in [[Israel]]. It had to be so as long 
as censorship was perceived as advancing Zionism’s cause. </p>
<p>Why has this changed? What social factors promoted that change? 
‘There were many reasons. One was the in[[flu]]ence of [[Western]] ways 
of life on the [[Israel]]is, especially upon younger age cohorts no 
longer prepared to tolerate the stifling atmosphere of the Zionist 
left as supinely as their predecessors did. But the crucial factor of 
change were in my view profound transformations in the profile 
of press readership which roughly took place between [[1974]] and 
[[1988]], in the aftermath of the first major gains won in struggles for 
extending the margins of freedom. </p>
<p>‘The character of the Hebrew press itself changed in this period 
markedly. A number of local commercially-oriented Friday papers 
began to appear, quickly becoming very popular. Moreover, the 
press learned to address itself to the mass of readers who were also 
regularly watching television. Far from losing the competition with 
television, the press prospered as never before. It is enough to say 
that Hebrew newspaper sales on an average Friday reach up to 
3.5 million copies within a national population of about 5 million 
which contains substantial minorities which don’t read Hebrew. 
But the social composition of the readership has also changed 
markedly since the mid-[[1950]]s. Within that population, the less 
educated, the poorer and consequently the more religious and 
right-leaning 50 per cent (or even more) tend to shun newspapers, 
contenting themselves with television. The other half, with opposite 
social characteristics, tend to buy each Friday two or even three 
papers, typically one national and one or two local ones, and read 
them assiduously. The same readership favours more sophisticated 
and more liberally-minded daily papers. By contrast, the tendency 
of the religious to refrain from reading any papers (even special 
weeklies published for their consumption are not overly popular 
among that public) has been reinforced by denunciations of the 
entire Hebrew press by their rabbis. Such denunciations became 
in the last decade increasingly immoderate: to the point of branding 
that press as a tool of Satan, capable of dooming its pious Jewish 
reader to untold calamities, not necessarily spiritual but also as 
physical as [[death]] in a traffic accident. By refusing to read the </p>
<p>20 OPEN’ SECRETS </p>
<p>newspapers (as well as all other ‘immoral’ printed matter), [[Israel]]i 
right-wingers become increasingly illiterate. </p>
<p>The bulk of this ‘new press’, as it is called, is commercial. Two 
still extant papers of the Zionist ‘left’ (at the time of the writing), 
Davar and Al Hamishmar, have steadily dropping circulations. 
Even when owned by the right-wingers, the commercial press, lest 
it incurs financial losses, needs therefore to cater to the tastes of 
its readers, becoming in effect more liberal-minded than the [[Israel]]i 
Jews — as best proven by electoral returns — are on the average. When 
the late Robert Maxwell bought Maariv with the intention of 
supporting the views of Sharon and Shamir, its circulation dropped 
alarmingly, to the point that after Maxwell’s [[death]] it faced the 
prospect of imminent bankruptcy. It was then bought, however, 
by the right-wing gun merchant Ya’akov Nimrodi of [[Iran]]gate fame 
and given as a present to his son Ofer, a man in his thirties. The 
new management found that the only way to increase the paper’s 
circulation was by revising its earlier practice and publishing critical 
commentary. The financial situation improved almost instantly as 
a result of this decision. Not by chance, Maanv’s specialty soon 
became critiques of the Army, the favoured topic of the newspaper- 
reading 50 per cent [[Israel]]i Jewish public at the present moment. 
Not by chance either, this discussion opens with a quote from 
Maariv in favour of freedom of the press and the right of the public 
to know. During the last three months Maariv has published, for 
example, a remarkably well-[[research]]ed study of the Army’s criminal 
negligence at the time of the Sabra and Shatila massacres of [[1982]], 
a dispatch on the spreading use of [[drugs]] and alcohol in the elite 
units of the Army, and a story on how a sergeant-major beating 
the soldiers under his command was subsequently exonerated by 
the Army authorities. </p>
<p>Roughly similar is the story of the Tel Aviv local Friday paper 
Ha’ir, founded by the same Schocken family which owns [[Haaretz]]. 
Its circulation was anyway impressive, but the Schockens found 
that they raised it even more, when they published full-page ads 
depicting a stereotypical Haredi Jew or a stereotypical right-winger 
saying ‘I don’t read Ha ’ir because for me it is not religious enough’ 
or ‘nationally-minded enough’. Those ads, intended to lure the more 
open-minded public to buy the paper, met their purpose. On the 
eve of the last Independence Day the same paper published an article 
describing the massacres of Palestinians during the [[War]] of 
Independence. I have reliable information that the sales of this 
particular issue amounted to about 40 per cent in excess of 
average ones. </p>
<p>No wonder the first legal triumph in the struggle against the 
awesome powers of military censorship was won in [[1988]] by Ha ’r. 
Ha’ir appealed to the Supreme Court against the censorial ban of </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP 24 </p>
<p>an article criticizing the head of Mossad and speculating about the 
timing of his replacement. In the late [[1950]]s it was forbidden to even 
utter the word ‘Mossad’, and all references to any branches of [[Israel]]i 
Intelligence, no matter how oblique, were banned routinely. Being 
no party to the Editors’ Committee, Ha’ir was not bound by any 
commitment not to appeal to the Supreme Court. Responding to 
Ha’ir’s suit, the Supreme Court voided the decision of the censor, 
and ruled that since freedom of expression was a supreme value, 
it needed to be protected from potential impairments by all means 
available, and that it could be allowed to be impaired only when 
it would be necessary to uphold the value of state’s security. In the 
wake of this ruling, a new clause was added to the [[1966]] agreement 
between the Editors’ Committee and the military censorship. The 
clause remained secret until disclosed by Hayim Tzadok (‘An 
improper use of censorship’, Yediot Ahronot, 17 [[November]]) and 
then by [[Haaretz]] 26 [[November]]. The clause reads: ‘From now on, 
censorship will be bound by the Supreme Court ruling 680/88, 
which forbids the ban of any contents for publication, except in 
cases of near-certainty that a given publication can tangibly hurt 
the security of the state.” As Tzadok points out, ‘the quoted “near- 
certainty” clause clearly means that security of the state can be 
upheld at the expense of freedom of expression only under extreme 
conditions of high and ascertainable risk to it. The censor can use 
his authority only for this purpose, never for any other purposes, 
extraneous to his functions.’ </p>
<p>‘The circumstances of the last censorship-related scandal can be 
described briefly. A fatal Army training exercise in T's’elim resulted 
in [[death]] of five soldiers. The news that the Chief of Staff and his 
deputy attended that exercise was cleared for publication only 
after an Inquiry Committee chaired by General (Reserves) Einan, 
appointed to investigate that disaster, had reached and announced 
its findings. Only then was the press allowed to inform the public 
that reports of the presence of the Chief of Staff and his entourage 
at the scene had been submitted for the censor’s approval night after 
the accident, first by [[Haaretz]], and then by other papers, but the 
censor banned their publication. The news to this effect were 
finally cleared with a week’s delay, simultaneously with the Einan 
Committee’s findings. This infuriated the press, since the clearance 
was delivered on Friday, one hour before the beginning of the 
Sabbath, postponing publication until Sunday and enabling the 
authorities to fine-tune the impact by suitably dosing the news in 
the [[government]]-owned electronic media which broadcast 
throughout the Sabbath. </p>
<p>As Tzadok and other commentators pointed out, the initial ban 
had constituted a flagrant violation of the [[1988]] amendment quoted 
above to the agreement between the press and the censorship. </p>
<p>22 OPEN SBCREPS </p>
<p>Tzadok wrote, ‘It is evident that the publication of the news about 
the presence of the Chief of Staff and his entourage during the 
Ts’elim accident could not zmpair the security of the state, let 
alone impair tangibly, let alone impair ascertainably, let alone with 
near-certainty. It defies all logic to suppose that right after the 
accident there was “near-certainty that the publication could 
tangibly hurt the security of the state”, whereas a week later all risk 
to security already disappeared, to the point that the story could 
be found fit for publication. One may understand the Army’s 
preference for publishing the story about the Chief of Staff’s 
attendance more or less simultaneously with the publication of the 
Inquiry Committee report. The use of censorship for purpose of 
ensuring such simultaneity is nevertheless absolutely inacceptable, 
because it flatly contradicts both the Supreme Court ruling and 
the agreement with the Editors’ Committee. Military censorship 
exists in order to protect the security of the state, not the convenience 
of the Chief of Staff. The discussed affair represents an instance 
of the flagrantly unlawful use of ‘censorship’. T'zadok’s function 
as the legal adviser of the Editors’ Committee, as one-time Justice 
Minister in a Labor [[government]] and a prominent leader of that 
party, could only add weight to his opinions, even though for years 
he has maintained his distance from the Labor leadership, while 
supporting more liberal policies. No wonder Tzadok’s position has 
been widely supported. </p>
<p>Soon afterwards, [[Haaretz]] took an unprecedented step and 
announced its decision to withdraw from participating in the 
Editors’ Committee. Coming together with the mentioned first- 
ever publication of the previously banned texts of the agreements, 
[[Haaretz]]’s decision reopened public discussion of the censorship. 
As Klasenbald explains, ‘In practice, [[Haaretz]]’s renunciation of the 
agreement means that the Editors’ Committee will no longer make 
decisions in disputes between the paper and the censor, and that 
the Chief of Staff will no longer have the supreme authority to 
approve or disapprove such decisions. It seems likely that [[Haaretz]] 
will continue to submit to censorship those items which were 
agreed upon between the press and the censorship as requiring 
submission there, but the paper will feel free to bring suits against 
the censorship to the courts.’ The subject-matters requiring such 
submission were listed and the lists periodically revised by 
agreements between the editors and the censor. Everything falling 
under a listed thematic category had to be submitted to preventive 
censorship. But the [[government]] also retains its power to ban the 
publication of any contents whatsoever. For example, all references 
to Ethiopia were for a time banned in order to maintain a good 
relationship with the Ethiopian dictator Mengistu. The suits may 
range from appeals against any censorship decisions or sanctions </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP 26 </p>
<p>to the Supreme Court, to appeals against criminal accusations for 
ignoring the censorial bans to lower courts. As Klasenbald points 
out, “The advantage lies in that the outcome of such legal actions 
will depend on legal procedure, the quality of evidence rules, 
timing of sessions, the value of precedents and the openness of the 
hearings: 1.e. on all that was for the most part [[missing]] from the 
de[[liberation]]s before the Editors’ Committee.’ </p>
<p>The remainder of this discussion will deal with the latitude the 
[[Israel]]i [[government]] still has for deviously concealing information 
not normally concealed in other democratic countries, on the 
pretext that it may be security-related, no matter how tenuous in 
fact. Some concealed information is eventually described by the 
Hebrew press through recourse to all kinds of circumlocution. In 
other cases, however, the press is forced to keep silence, at best being 
allowed to acknowledge its inability to inform the public. By far 
the best-qualified practitioner of the art of circumlocution has in 
my view been Amir Oren, who invariably manages to provide in 
this manner valuable information whenever he cannot talk straight. 
After the T’s’elim accident, there were many who wondered why 
the Investigating Military Police hadn’t arrived on the scene instantly 
to investigate. On [[November]] 20, Oren wrote in Davar. “The 
Military Police Commander might well have gone to T’s’elim right 
upon learning of the calamity, but on the way there he might have 
had to turn back when an officer senior in rank requested that the 
Investigating Military Police stay away. Ifso, we might perhaps learn 
something of value about the subordination of the Military Police 
to the Army’s hierarchy.’ The quoted sentences, convoluted as they 
are, nevertheless enable Oren’s readers to formulate a reasonable 
conjecture that it was the Chief of Staff who ordered the 
Commander of the Military Police to desist from investigating the 
case, because he had his reasons to be afraid of an investigation 
that would be too professional. </p>
<p>As early as [[December]] [[1981]], Oren was the first to warn the 
[[Israel]]i public that the invasion of [[Lebanon]] was in the making, and 
he even managed to correctly predict its aims and extent: all this 
with the help of circumlocutions similar to those quoted above. 
Somewhat later, his art was emulated by Ya’akov Erez, then a 
military correspondent of Maariv, who authored the sequence of 
‘Legends for natives’ describing how tribal chiefs on a Polynesian 
island, bearing suitably devised names, visited a civil war-ravaged 
part of another exotic island. It didn’t take much sophistication to 
decipher that Erez’s stories referred to the pre-[[June]] [[1982]] visitations 
of Falangist-held part of Beirut by the chiefs of the [[Israel]]i Army 
and Mossad. Elsewhere, instead of disguised locations, the 
Talmudic proverb ‘For the astute a hint will suffice’ would be used </p>
<p>24 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>to alert the reader to a recondite message in an innocuous 
information. </p>
<p>Let me give an example which shows the extent to which [[Israel]]i 
censorship is still capable of stifling a public discussion of what is 
anyway public knowledge. On the top of anew Ministry of Defence 
building, located in the downtown of Tel Aviv, a spire of sorts 
stretches upward to about 50 storeys. Of course, the structure can 
be seen by everybody and must have been photographed many times 
by the most incompetent agents of the most incompetent intelligence 
services of the world. In the initial stages of the construction, the 
elongation was photographed as a tourist site and commented on 
by the Hebrew press, until the cost-benefit questions about this 
oddity of colossal dimensions began to be seriously raised. In 
response, the Ministry instructed the censors to bluepencil absolutely 
everything connected with this building, beginning with its 
photographs and including any statement which would as much 
as Mention its existence. Everyone living in or visiting Tel Aviv may 
see the strange spire, but no one can mention it in public. Granted 
that, the Hebrew press has found ways to outwit censorship, even 
on this point, for the benefit of those who care enough to read 
newspapers between the lines. Of course, such attempts to thwart 
public knowledge smack of plain crassness. But this crassness must 
be taken into consideration in discussions of [[Israel]]i military 
censorship, as well as of the authorities behind it, namely the 
Commander of the Military Intelligence and the Chief of Staff. </p>
<p>All evidence indicates that the Army needs military censorship 
in order to further its own interests, in particular in order to 
maintain secrecy over its financial operations and over the ever more 
lucrative privileges of its cadres. Even the salaries of the professional 
Army personnel, down to the rank of private, are a top security secret 
in [[Israel]], though they are talked about by virtually everybody 
except, as it seems, the top-rank [[Israel]]i politicians, who alone 
remain ignorant of their magnitudes. Yair Fidel’s account (Hadashot, 
27 [[November]]) gives us an idea of how strict is the secrecy 
surrounding this matter: “The previous Finance Minister, Moda’1, 
strongly opposed the remunerations received by the professional 
Army, considering them far too exorbitant. After he succeeded in 
learning their exact scale, he submitted a memo to his Prime 
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, presenting the figures involved. According 
to people close to Shamir, the Prime Minister was downright 
astounded by Moda’i’s memo, to the point of requesting his 
Defence Minister, Moshe Arens to meet him for clarifications. 
Before their meeting could take effect, the [[government]] fell. Since 
the new Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, also holds the Defence 
portfolio, he will at least not need himself as Defence Minister to 
brief himself as Prime Minister on the Army budget itemization.’ </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP 25 </p>
<p>Fidel raises the subject of secrecy explicitly: “We need all be aware 
that all such data have long been top secret, concealed not only 
from the public which had the right to know them, but from its 
[[representative]]s who had the duty to know them.’ They have also 
been kept secret from the income tax authorities. Hence the 
suspicion raised by Fidel and other commentators: that the [[Israel]]i 
Army has for years cheated the income tax office by not reporting 
a whole lot of taxable benefits granted to its cadres. I find it 
impossible to comment on such suspicions any further because 
censorship cuts have succeeded in making this affair unclear. I want 
only to stress that the [[Israel]]i Prime Ministers’ ignorance of ‘top secret 
matters’ which the citizenry commonly knows and talks about, 
places [[Israel]] in the same rank as the defunct East [[Europe]]an regimes, 
and — although most [[Israel]]i Jews would furiously resent such 
comparisons — as the still existing Arab or other undemocratic 
regimes. </p>
<p>Fidel’s reference to the itemization of the Army budget accords 
with an article by Aluf Ben (‘Far away from public eyes’, [[Haaretz]], 
25 [[August]]). Ben informs us that ‘since [[Israel]] exists, all specifications 
of the Defence budget have always been kept secret. By now its 
secrecy is even legislated by a Basic Law, namely the State Economic 
Affairs Law, which stipulates that “details of the Defence ministry’s 
proposed budgets may never be put on the Knesset’s table, but are 
to be deliberated only by a joint committee appointed by the 
Knesset’s Finance and Foreign Affairs and Defence Committees”. 
Gazetted annual budget laws contain only a single line devoted to 
the Defence ministry, namely the sum total allocated to that 
ministry that year, without any breakdowns.’ As Ben further states, 
even such data as ‘the expenditure of the Ministry of Defence 
publishing house’, which mainly publishes what goes under the 
name of ‘edifying literature’ (with political contents depending on 
whether the Defence Minister is from Labor or Likud), ‘remain 
classified as top secret’. The size of Defence Ministry donations 
‘to various associations, such as the “Beautiful I.and of [[Israel]]” 
organization’, are likewise kept top secret. Even ‘the weaponry sales 
of the US to [[Israel]], which are being systematically reported to the 
[[Congress]] and published in its documents and in the professional 
literature, are here kept secret. The [[Israel]]is are forbidden to know 
what every [[America]]n citizen can know.’ </p>
<p>The Hebrew press has since long done its best to penetrate this 
wall of totalitarian secrecy. Press attacks on censorship seem to have 
had some effects, especially when the country is in economic straits. 
Government ministers in charge of economic affairs expect to be 
blamed for economic woes, with the effect that censorial shielding 
of the Army’s financial secrets from exposure slackens a little. 
Owing to the censorial laxity, Fidel could finally inform the [[Israel]]i </p>
<p>26 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>public that ‘without counting the entire [[America]]n military aid to 
[[Israel]], 52 per cent of the [[Israel]]i Defence budget goes for salaries 
of the professional Army staffers, their perquisites and their pensions. 
In absolute figures this amounts to 5.8 billion shekels [$2.2 billion]’. 
But, as Ben rightly observes, this sum does not cover the unknown 
sum spent on the salaries, perquisites and pensions of the civilian 
officials of the Defence Ministry and other branches of the Security 
System, e.g. Intelligence. (The number of employees in the latter 
can be assumed to be considerable. ) </p>
<p>While providing data on perquisites of the professional Army, 
Fidel cautions his readers that other data still cannot be disclosed. 
He is at least able to say that ‘added to the basic salary is a lot of 
variegated perquisites’. For example, all dental care expenses of not 
just the professional Army staff but also of their families are covered 
by the Army. Since the Army wants its people to practice sports, 
it pays for their sport outfits and implements, also when used by 
their families. The army participates in their expenses for entry 
tickets to sports events, concerts, theatres and ‘other cultural 
events’. In addition to that, there are paid vacations with families, 
subsidies for renting or building apartments or houses, and the so- 
called ‘[[white]] vehicles’, that is, cars used not for work but for private 
purposes of Army officers and their families, which cause much 
resentment among the public when they appear conspicuously in 
[[Israel]]i towns, especially parked outside luxurious entertainment 
venues. Fidel adds that ‘according to the Finance Ministry, the 
number of employees on the professional Army’s payroll has in the 
last decade decreased by 10 per cent, but the number of “[[white]] 
vehicles” has risen by 15 per cent, to the level of 1.1 “[[white]] vehicle”, 
per officer.’ </p>
<p>To sum up, because of its use of censorship, in addition to other 
factors, the [[Israel]]i Army is growing rapidly more corrupt. Since the 
public and even the politicians are denied access to knowledge about 
the extent of its corruption, its impact must be all the greater. With 
the help of generous [[America]]n aid to [[Israel]], flowing without any 
strings attached the quality of the [[Israel]]i Army deteriorates even 
further. In the first place, that aid only encourages [[Israel]] to further 
conquests and aggressions. In my view this situation may yet get 
much worse. Judging from well-known precedents, states can be 
stuffed with military aid from the US to the point of both military 
and political indigestion. Ample evidence indicates that US military 
aid, contrary to its avowed purposes, only contributes to making 
the [[Israel]]i Army more corrupt and less efficient. [[Israel]]’s power to 
in[[flu]]ence US policies, especially via [[Congress]] which holds the 
purse-strings, is for [[Israel]] more decisive than any vaunted strategic 
or diplomatic assets. In domestic social terms, however, it means 
that [[Israel]] increasingly resembles those Latin [[America]]n countries </p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE AGAINST MILITARY CENSORSHIP 2] </p>
<p>in which the role of the Army is reduced to extorting money from 
the taxpayers for maintaining its own bureaucracy. Military 
censorship helps achieve this effect bounteously. [[Israel]], however, 
has shown itself capable of waging aggressive wars, which may enable 
its Army to lay its hands on sources of wealth capable of gratifying 
its growing appetite. This must be seen as a major factor in Middle 
[[Eastern]] politics. Although the stupidity of the [[Israel]]i Army brass 
is by now proverbial, they are still capable of grasping (especially 
when briefed by academics on their payroll) that [[Israel]]i economy 
cannot be endlessly drained just to gratify their increasing appetite, 
and that even the US [[Congress]], so generous in supplying 
armaments, cannot be hoped to disburse forever free monies for 
luxuries. This is why they would do anything to redeem their 
dwindling prestige and at the same time lay their hands on other 
nations’ wealth by wars of conquest. This much they are capable 
of understanding, in the same way as military oligarchies in the past 
have understood it. </p>

<p>[[Israel]]’s Strategic Aims and Nuclear 
Weapons 
27 [[April]] [[1992]] </p>
<p>Introduction </p>
<p>‘This chapter illustrates, quoting the most important [[Israel]]i generals 
and intelligence experts commenting, in the pages of the Hebrew 
press, what I consider to be the real aims of the [[Israel]]i policies: 
establishing a hegemony over the entire Middle East, ‘stabilizing’ 
the regimes which do not disturb too much the [[Israel]]i progress 
toward that aim and a possible use of [[nuclear]] weapons for this 
purpose. General Amnon Shahak-Lipkin, mentioned in this chapter, 
is now, under the name of General Amnon Shahak, the Chief of Staff 
of the [[Israel]]i Army. General (Reserves) Shlomo Gazit was one of 
the [[Israel]]i negotiators in the talks with the PLO (or rather with the 
PLO’s secret police commanders) which led to the Oslo I Accord. </p>
<p>On [[April]] 17 [[1992]], the Passover Eve, two [[Israel]]i Army generals who 
can be regarded as the next in rank after the Chief of Staff gave 
exhaustive interviews to the Hebrew press. The Deputy Chief of 
Staff, General Amnon Shahak-Lipkin [now Chief of Staff] was 
interviewed in Maariv by Ya’akov Erez and Immanuel Rozen; the 
Commander of Military Intelligence, General Uri Saguy was 
interviewed in Yediot’ Ahronot by Ron Ben-Yishay. On the same 
day Oded Brosh, a distinguished expert in [[nuclear]] politics who can 
be presumed to speak in a semi-official capacity, published an 
article in [[Haaretz]] which for the first time in the Hebrew press 
openly discusses the options for the actual use of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] 
weapons during a war. The contents of these items should be 
juxtaposed with some recent press articles to generalize our 
knowledge of [[Israel]]i strategic aims and of the [[nuclear]] factor in [[Israel]]i 
strategic planning. </p>
<p>Before doing so, however, it may be worthwile to remind non- 
[[Israel]]i readers that since [[Israel]]’s strategies are regional in their 
orientation, their concern with the Palestinians is secondary. In fact, 
the oppression of Palestinians does not interest the [[Israel]]i strategists </p>
<p>ai </p>
<p>52 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>in the least. It follows that what goes under the name of ‘the 
solution of the Palestinian problem’, whatever the nature of that 
‘solution’ is, cannot bring about peace, because [[Israel]]i strategies 
are aimed at establishing a hegemony over the entire Middle East, 
conceived of as extending from India to Mauritania. Of course, the 
first victim of [[Israel]]i expansionism in search of such a hegemony 
is the Palestinian nation. But, it should be added, establishing a 
hegemony over the entire Middle East is more important in [[Israel]]i 
strategic thinking than the extension and the perpetuation of Jewish 
jurisdiction over the entire land of [[Israel]], however extravagantly 
its borders may be defined. </p>
<p>Before really proceeding to the subject-matter of this report, let 
me retell a story, described by one of the better-informed [[Israel]]i 
strategic commentators, Yoav Karni (‘Old fashioned [[Israel]]i 
methods’, [[Haaretz]], 25 [[March]]). The story needs to be placed in the 
context of the [[America]]n factor in the [[Israel]]i grand strategy. Karni 
is critical of the idea of a world-wide strategic cooperation between 
the US and [[Israel]] as proposed in public by the [[Israel]]i Ambassador 
in [[Washington]], Zalman Shoval but not mentioned in the US press. 
According to Karni, “The White House was asked to ignore the 
misdeeds of the [[[Israel]]i] [[government]] and their consequences, and 
to overcome its understandable resentment [of [[Israel]]i conduct] in 
recognition that [[Israel]] can be for the US an irreplaceable strategic 
asset.’ Why? Because ‘the new Muslim republics in Central Asia, 
emerging from the ruins of the USSR, “will certainly become 
Muslim funda[[mental]]ist and anti-[[Western]] states and thereby 
terrorize the Middle East more than the USSR ever terrorized it.”” 
Shoval ‘expressed his astonishment that the US does not 
understand’ how imminent this danger is, and the fact that only 
[[Israel]] is capable of countering it. While poking fun at Shoval, 
Karni shrewdly (so as to confound the censors) revealed for the 
first time an authentic story of [[Israel]]’s diplomatic pursuit of its 
strategic aims: ‘Even India, which nine years ago expelled a garrulous 
[[Israel]]i consul who wanted to elicit its participation in a cosmic 
struggle against all Muslims, recently requested to be placed on 
the [[Israel]]i Foreign Ministry’s mailing list.’ The episode referred to 
occurred in [[1983]]. Sharon, then a Defence Minister, felt self- 
confident after signing, with full [[America]]n blessing, a ‘peace’ with 
the puppet Lebanese [[government]]. With all complacency, he 
proposed to India an [[alliance]] for the sake of jointly attacking 
[[Pakistan]], with the aim of destroying the latter’s budding [[nuclear]] 
capability. In this scheme [[Israel]] was to supply the aircraft and 
India provide the bases. Incidentally, only two years earlier, in [[1981]], 
Sharon made a speech, later widely publicized, in which he defined 
the extension of [[Israel]]’s in[[flu]]ence ‘from Mauritania to Afghanistan’ 
as an [[Israel]]i aim. There is plenty of evidence from openly available </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 33 </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i sources that this is [[Israel]]’s strategic aim. The only problem 
is that this conflicts with US policies, whether avowed or actually 
pursued. Still, [[Israel]] has an enormous latitude for action when the 
[[America]]ns know nothing about [[Israel]]i aims because they don’t want 
to know. Interestingly, all branches of [[America]]n Intelligence may 
be even more wilfully ignorant in this respect than the US media. </p>
<p>Karni by no means exaggerates when he speaks of an [[Israel]]i 
‘cosmic struggle against all Muslims’. The same or similar notions 
crop up constantly in official explanations of the [[Israel]]i Security 
System’s current policies. Thus, the chief political correspondent 
of [[Haaretz]], Uzi Benziman describes on (20 [[March]]) how his sources 
in the Security System reacted to his mild and censorship-conscious 
reservations about the wisdom of the [[assassination]] of the Lebanese 
Sheikh Mussawi and his family, in view of possible adverse 
consequences for [[Israel]]. The reaction was: “The [[kill]]ing of Mussawi 
can be considered a retaliation for murders and deadly assaults 
against the [[Israel]]is committed by Muslim fanatics of any stripe. 
Some people are always ready to remind us that [[Israel]] 1s engaged 
in the long-term struggle against all Arab states and against all 
Islamic fanaticism, which all accept murder as a norm of behaviour. 
Because of that, blood-price-calculation-based criticism of the 
[[[Israel]]i] [[government]] is inherently unjust. The [[[Israel]]i] norm is 
best expressed by the words of [the then Labor Prime Minister] 
Levy Eshko: “The account book is open, but it is our hand which 
is filling it.” This means that blood accounting is to be made by 
the State of [[Israel]] vis-a-vis all its enemies treated as a single whole, 
rather than on the basis of calculations which particular citizens of 
[[Israel]] want to use against their own [[government]].’ (Notice 
Benziman’s peculiar censorship-conscious vocabulary, e.g. his use 
of such terms as ‘some people’.) This view may seem to be mad, 
but it has been held by the [[Israel]]i Security System from time 
immemorial, since long before [[Israel]]’s inception. In Hebrew, it has 
been quoted often enough by prestigious commentators, Benziman 
included. But to the best of my knowledge, it has never been 
quoted by any mainstream paper outside [[Israel]]. But even in [[Israel]], 
open challenges to this strategic madness are relatively rare, due 
not only to censorship but even more so to the customary adulation 
of [[Israel]]i Intelligence. Yet, translated into plain language, this 
strategy assumes a perpetual [[warfare]] to be carried out by [[Israel]] 
against a sizeable proportion of humanity. </p>
<p>Recent announcements by [[Israel]]i generals and [[nuclear]] experts 
can be properly understood only when these overall strategic aims 
are taken into account. Let me open my list of quotes with the 
Deputy Chief of Staff, General Amnon Shahak-Lipkin, whose rise 
in the ranks began in [[1982]]-85, when, still a mere Military 
Intelligence Colonel, he escorted [[Israel]]i newsmen on visits to </p>
<p>34 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Falangist leaders, using this occasion for peddling to the media his 
views on how strong Falangist forces were, and how firmly [[Israel]] 
could rely on them in the pursuit of its own goals in [[Lebanon]]. His 
crucial statement was made in his reply to the questions ‘Assuming 
that the Middle East becomes [[nuclear]]ized, hasn’t the time come 
to change our attitudes towards [[nuclear]] realities? Shouldn’t we begin 
thinking about them in terms of negotiations, of secret diplomacy? 
Will we be always able to prevent the progress of [[nuclear]]ization?’ 
His answer: ‘It is never possible to talk to Iraq about no matter what; 
it is never possible to talk to [[Iran]] about no matter what. Certainly 
not about [[nuclear]]ization. With Syria we cannot really talk either. 
I also don’t agree that preventing or postponing [[[nuclear]]ization] 
is not in our power. A postponent by one week may be crucial, while 
a postponent for ten years would be magnificent. Today, not a single 
Arab state has a proven [[nuclear]] capability. I believe that the State 
of [[Israel]] should from now on use all its power and direct all its efforts 
to preventing [[nuclear]] developments in any Arab state whatsoever.’ 
Question: ‘Does this imply the need for violent means as well?’ 
Answer: ‘In my opinion, all or most [available] means serving that 
purpose are legitimate.’ </p>
<p>Shahak-Lipkin’s reference to Iraq should not be construed, 
however, as his opposition to the rule of Saddam Hussein. The 
interviewers reminded him that ‘at a meeting held on the last day 
of the Gulf [[War]], [but not reported then] you opined that it was in 
the [[Israel]]i interest that Saddam Hussein remained in power.’ When 
they probed whether he considered ‘this opinion still correct’, the 
General answered, ‘As far as I am concerned, it would be preferable 
if Saddam Hussein had not been born. We tried to prevent his birth 
but we failed. Now we need to decide what to do. It would have 
been ideal for everybody if it were possible to change the character 
of the Iraqi regime, and its insane attitude of hostility toward the 
entire world. But in Iraq no change will ever be possible. Iraq will 
always remain the same, bent on defying the entire world. True, 
it was helped by the entire world to become what it became. But 
since Iraqi thinking can never change, a possible removal of Saddam 
Hussein alone can only lead to the emergence of another dictator 
who will smile nicely to the entire world. And the entire world, 
anxious to somehow recompense Iraq for hardships it had inflicted 
on it, will help in its recovery and in restoration of its capabilities. 
Therefore, if I have to choose between a boycotted Iraq with 
Saddam and an Iraq without Saddam again supported by the 
entire world, then I opt for Saddam, because Saddam will never 
be helped by anyone.’ </p>
<p>Before discussing the little that is known about how [[Israel]] is 
actually helping Saddam Hussein to survive in power in accordance 
with the just declared preferences, let me yet comment on the </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 35 </p>
<p>recurrent phrase ‘the entire world’. This phrase reflects another 
concept underlying [[Israel]]i strategic thinking. The concept is that 
in addition to the Arabs or the Muslims who are open enemies, 
other Gentiles, regarded as a single entity and united in pursuing 
aims correctly detectable and decipherable by [[Israel]]i Intelligence, 
are without exception both evil and stupid. This concept, at least, 
has been frequently challenged in [[Israel]] in public, in contrast to 
perception of the evil nature of the Arabs or the Muslims. A typical 
example of such a challenge is a critique of Shamir’s speech in the 
Knesset, eulogizing (and misrepresenting) Begin, authored by 
Amnon Abramovitz (Maanv, 10 [[April]]). In his speech Shamir said 
that during World [[War]] II ‘the Jewish nation was left to be ground 
between the two belligerent blocs equally hostile toward the Jews 
and indifferent to their bitter fate.” Abramovitz comments: ‘What 
does it mean that “the Jewish nation was thus left to be ground 
between the two belligerent blocs?” It can only mean that the two 
sides in World [[War]] II had the same moral qualities, while we, the 
Jews, were being ground as they fought each other. Is it possible 
that the news of extermination of 6 million Jews by the Germans 
hasn’t yet reached Shamir’s notice? What does it mean that “both 
[were] equally hostile toward the Jews and indifferent to their 
bitter fate”? It can only mean that the Nazi Germany was merely 
indifferent to our bitter fate. Does Shamir mean to say that Churchill 
and Hitler treated us in the same way? Yet it is not hard to conjecture 
what Shamir had in mind. In his view, the entire world has always 
been against the Jews and so it remains. In this respect, Churchill 
is no different than Hitler, George [[Bush]] no different than Saddam 
Hussein and Mitterand no different than Gaddafi.’ [[Israel]]i strategical 
ideas are incomprehensible without the realization that a vision of 
the world such as Shamir’s is shared by the [[Israel]]i Security System. 
The pronouncements of its generals and highly placed ‘sources’ 
are the best evidence of that. </p>
<p>In the remainder of his interview, General Shahak-Lipkin 
reiterates, often verbatim, the conventional views of the [[Israel]]i 
Security System which require here no more than a quite cursory 
presentation. [[Israel]] acts under ‘a threat to its survival’, Syria 1s ‘a 
terrorist state’ and ‘almost all terrorist infiltrations from [[Lebanon]] 
[to [[Israel]]] originate from Syria.’ (Interestingly, [[Iran]] is not mentioned 
in this context, nor is [[Libya]]; there is no comment about these by 
Saguy either.) Shahak-Lipkin’s other arguments of the same type 
are that Iraq’s military power is still great, that the [[kill]]ing of 
Mussawi was fully justified, (his family is not mentioned), that the 
[[Israel]]i public is guilty of criticizing the Army and that ‘we [the Army] 
have received only 40 per cent of the money we requested’ and 
therefore need a lot more. Although little space is devoted to the </p>
<p>36 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>situation in the [[Territories]], it is assessed as satisfactory, since a lot 
of wanted Palestinians have been [[kill]]ed. </p>
<p>General Saguy fully shares the notion of a threat to [[Israel]]’s very 
survival: ‘Syria has always been and still is a threat to the security 
and very survival of the State of [[Israel]]’, the reason being that 
‘Syria continues to arm itself.’ This statement is documented by 
a long list of Syrian weaponry purchases, without mentioning 
[[Israel]]i ones. Saguy does admit that Syria is afraid of [[Israel]] and that 
its armament is motivated by the wish ‘to confront the [[Israel]]i 
strategic [i.e. [[nuclear]]] weaponry, which the Arabs believe [[Israel]] 
possesses’. He also admits that Syria is afraid of a massive [[Israel]]i 
invasion of its territory: ‘According to the Taif Agreement [between 
Syria and [[Lebanon]]] Syria is allowed to keep the bulk of its armed 
forces in the [Lebanese] Baalbek area. The Syrians believe that 
such a deployment can be an answer to an [[Israel]]i attempt to 
outflank Damascus [from the north] in the event of a war.’ Let 
me comment on this. As 1s Known, the area between Damascus 
and the Golan Heights is heavily fortified, but no fortifications seem 
to exist north of Damascus or along the Syrian—Lebanese borders. 
Since outflanking a fortified defence line has been the [[Israel]]i 
Army’s favourite method of attacking, Syrian fears appear to me 
well-grounded. </p>
<p>What Saguy says he is afraid of, is ‘a Syrian—[[Iran]]ian [[alliance]]’. 
The exchange on this subject with his interviewer deserves to be 
quoted 7m extenso: “Question: Can an [[alliance]] of Syria with [[Iran]] serve 
as a substitute for an [[alliance]] between Syria and Iraq in the 
formation of the eastern front against [[Israel]]? Answer: There is a 
collaboration between Syria and [[Iran]] in plenty of things. It is going 
to be closer. Perhaps even in strategic weaponry, and the non- 
conventional ventures. Question: Is [[Iran]] helping Syria to obtain 
[[nuclear]] weapons? Answer: At this stage not yet. But when [[Iran]] itself 
becomes [[nuclear]]ized, I cannot see how it can avoid cooperating 
[in this matter] with Syria. Such a prospect should worry us, even 
though it is still distant ... In ten years’ time [[Iran]] will certainly 
become a decisive factor in the entire region, and as such an ever- 
present threat to its peace. This can hardly be prevented, unless 
somebody intervenes directly. It is quite probable that outside 
factors such as the US, alone or together with other states, would 
intervene to halt the progress of [[Iran]]ian rearmarment. But a 
historical paradox is also possible: Iraq may rearm itself, with the 
effect of checking the growth of [[Iran]]ian armed power.’ </p>
<p>A long-standing [[Israel]]i custom commands the generals in active 
service to stop short of saying too much in interviews, but it lets 
semi-official experts or retired generals reveal the [[Israel]]i strategic 
intentions to the nation’s elite in a more informative manner. The 
explanation of the crucial and most sensitive [[Israel]]i strategic aims, </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 37 </p>
<p>concerning the role of [[nuclear]] weapons in overall [[Israel]]i strategy 
was left to Oded Brosh. Brosh begins by saying that some [[Israel]]is 
are now raising the question whether ‘[[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power’ helps 
or obstructs a transferral of the regional conflict to diplomatic 
channels. This he deplores, since the very phrasing of this question 
in such terms ‘introduces a bias in favour of the recent opponents 
of [[Israel]]’s [[nuclear]] option, while casting a negative light on the 
supporters of this option’. He is particularly virulent against some 
unnamed advocates of an ‘appeasement’ in the form of only ‘a 
limited use of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power, referred to as “the last-minute 
option”’. Those obscure remarks may refer to the bare beginning 
of a belated but at least serious discussion of the [[health]] hazards 
contingent on the existence of [[nuclear]] installations. Brosh’s article 
was indeed, ‘balanced’ in [[Haaretz]] by another article, printed right 
next to it which for the first time in [[Israel]]’s [[history]] reported how 
people had organized themselves in [[protest]] against [[health]] hazards 
stemming from the existence of a civilian [[nuclear]] installation in their 
neighbourhood. But without any attribution, Brosh also refers to 
claims, still unattributable, to the effect that ‘Dimona might yet 
become another Chernobyl’. He concedes that ‘the responsible 
authorities indeed need to test again and again’ their precautionary 
measures, forgetting that ‘the authorities responsible’ for Chernobyl 
also claimed that they had been recurrently [[testing]] their precautions. 
He leaves unanswered the question of who in [[Israel]] can be 
authorized to test the [[testing]] undertaken by unnamed ‘authorities’. </p>
<p>Brosh must be presumed to aim his polemic at critics more 
prominent than those concerning themselves with [[health]] hazards, 
because he mentions some unnamed [[Israel]]is who are said by him 
to argue ‘that in view of what the foreign media report from time 
to time about the growth of [[Israel]]’s [[nuclear]] assets, their further 
growth should be halted. Sometimes it 1s even being argued that 
somebody authorized or unauthorized might activate one or several 
[[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] warheads through either error or accident. Moreover, 
some argue that [[Israel]]’s unremittent [[nuclear]] development only 
propels Arab countries, [[Iran]] and other Muslim states to equip 
themselves with all sorts of non-conventional, but primarily [[nuclear]], 
weapons.’ None of these apprehensions have ever appeared not only 
in the censored Hebrew press but, to the best of my knowledge, 
in the mainstream international press as well. All of them are 
nevertheless in my view quite justified. Not only is the prospect of 
Dimona one day becoming another Chernobyl something to be 
seriously discussed. The prospect of Gush Emunim (“The Block 
of the Faithful’), or some secular right-wing [[Israel]]i fanatics, or some 
of the delirious [[Israel]]i Army generals, seizing control of [[Israel]]i 
[[nuclear]] weapons and using them in accordance with their 
‘knowledge’ of politics or by the authority of ‘divine command’ </p>
<p>38 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>cannot be precluded either. In my view the likelihood of the 
occurrence of some such calamity is growing. We should not forget 
that while [[Israel]]i Jewish society undergoes a steady political 
polarization, the [[Israel]]i Security System increasingly relies on the 
recruitment of cohorts from the ranks of the extreme right. </p>
<p>Brosh hurries to admit to his readers that ‘not everybody who 
hates Dimona — whether in [[Israel]]i or abroad — hates [[Israel]]. On the 
contrary, a great many foreigners who perceive the Dimona reactor 
as an evil have an affection for [[Israel]].’ Yet the [[Israel]]is who ‘hate 
Dimona’ are apparently not quite the same. Brosh is worried by 
their critique, especially since they are said by him to propose ‘that 
the Dimona reactor be closed’ in order to be thereafter ‘accessible 
to international controls capable of proving to our neighbours that 
we no longer produce any fissionable substances’. Such a proof 
could be offered ‘to our neighbours’ either in a gesture of good will 
or within the framework of a regional settlement. But while 
admitting the desirability of more frequent and thorough checks 
to preclude Chernobyl-like accidents, Brosh disqualifies ‘all other 
apprehensions of the enemies of Dimona as [[flu]]nking the test of 
technical and political realities in our region’. We need to keep in 
mind that [[Israel]]i censorship has thus far prevented the publication 
of what ‘the enemies of Dimona’ have to say. We know about their 
existence and their arguments only what their open enemy, Brosh, 
wanted and was permitted by that censorship to tell us. </p>
<p>Let me ignore Brosh’s brief, superficial and in my view inaccurate 
presentation of the mentioned ‘technical realities’. Let me just 
mention that he highly commends ‘what goes under the name of 
the neutron [[bomb]], developed by the [[America]]ns in the [[1970]]s’. Let 
me concentrate on what, apparently reiterating the lessons learned 
from his mentors, he has to say about ‘the political realities in our 
region’, in so far as they have a bearing upon [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power. 
Regarding the uses of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] weapons during a war, Brosh 
sees two major options. The first, ‘the last-minute option’ is defined 
as ‘a scenario which in fact presumes that [[Israel]] will refrain from 
making any [[nuclear]] threats unless it is defeated by conventional 
weapons, or can realistically expect such a defeat as imminent, or 
is threatened by use of non-conventional weapons’. In this way ‘the 
Arab leaders can be denied a victory’ by the threat of ‘the destruction 
of Arab civilization’. In my view, this can be interpreted as meaning 
that [[Israel]] has contingency plans for cases of extreme emergency 
which envisage a devastation by [[nuclear]] weapons of a considerable 
number of Arab urban centres and such crucial installations as the 
Aswan Dam (whose destruction was envisaged in [[Israel]] before 
[[1973]]). This awful possibility needs to be faced, however horrifying 
may be the thought about its direct effects on the Arab world and 
indirect effects upon the entire world in terms of massive human </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 39 </p>
<p>casualties and the long-term effects of radioactivity. The likely 
existence of such plans needs to be considered jointly with a 
passage about ‘somebody authorized or unauthorized [who] might 
activate one or several [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] warheads through error or 
accident’. A juxtaposition of the two passages adds to both clarity 
and horror. By [[1992]], [[Israel]] already abounds in Jewish religious 
zealots whose in[[flu]]ence within the Security System is growing 
steadily. Gush Emunim or the followers of any extremist Hassidic 
rabbi are quite capable in my view of activating such scenarios even 
in peacetime for the sake of thus advancing their Messianic 
prophecies which by definition imply that God will protect the Jews 
from any injury and inflict devastation on Gentiles alone. </p>
<p>But Brosh does not favour ‘the last-minute option’. Being by no 
means a religious fanatic he does clearly realize that this option 
implies not just ‘the destruction of the Arab civilization’, but also 
‘our own national suicide’. He also has strategic objections against 
this option which can be conjectured to draw on the experience 
of the [[October]] [[1973]] [[War]]. He anticipates that the Arab leaders might 
attack [[Israel]], not for the sake of defeating it but for other reasons. 
In case the attack turns militarily successful, ‘the last-minute 
option’ might prompt the [[Israel]]i leaders, even the relatively sane 
among them, to a [[nuclear]] response. When dealing with the long- 
concealed events of [[October]] [[1973]] [[War]], I documented that the 
[[Israel]]i Army High Command of that time, possibly including 
Moshe Dayan, favoured [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] response against Syria, 
but were halted in doing so by Golda Meir, backed by Kissinger. 
Much as I abhor what Brosh says I have to admit that he is not 
the most extremist among [[Israel]]i experts anticipating the use of 
[[nuclear]] weapons. </p>
<p>Brosh’s own proposals, which can be assumed express the views 
of the [[Israel]]i Security System, rest on the assumption that ‘it is 
preferable to competently elaborate a system of options which 
would include the instru[[mental]]ities of handling the problems 
arising from a potential massive [[missile]] or armoured attack against 
us, if 1t one day materializes, and which would prepare means to 
deter such an attack, or to foil it, if the deterrence fails’. He adds 
that pertinent [[Israel]]i ‘decisions should better not be dictated by 
outside factors’, a transparent allusion to the US. This option 
should not be resorted to in his opinion, ‘as long as the threat to 
us comes from no more than a single, even if major, Arab state such 
as Syria’ and if it involves only the use of conventional weapons. 
He immediately stipulates, however, that ‘even in such a case, it 
would be preferable to leave the enemy befogged about our 
intentions’. Let me clarify, however, that in [[Israel]]i terminology, the 
launching of [[missile]]s on to [[Israel]]i territory is regarded as ‘non- </p>
<p>40 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>conventional’, regardless of whether they are equipped with 
explosives or poison gas. </p>
<p>Still arguing against his unidentified opponents, Brosh contends 
that ‘there is absolutely no connection between unremitting [[Israel]]i 
[[nuclear]] development and Arab, [[Iran]]ian or [[Pakistan]]i pursuits’, in 
spite of the fact that [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] weapons are, or at least may 
be, aimed at those countries. But Brosh goes even deeper in his 
arguments: ‘Generally, in long-term security planning one cannot 
ignore the political factors. [[Israel]] must take into account, for 
example, that the [[Saudi]] royal family is not going to reign forever 
or that the [[Egypt]]ian regime may change.’ Precisely because of 
such political contingencies [[Israel]] must remain free to use or 
threaten to use its [[nuclear]] weapons. Brosh argues that ‘we need 
not be ashamed that the [[nuclear]] option is a major instru[[mental]]ity 
of our defence as a deterrent against those who may attack us. The 
three big democracies have relied on the same deterrent for decades.’ 
The very comparison of [[Israel]]’s strategic aims with those of the US, 
[[Britain]] and [[France]] is an irrefutable proof of [[Israel]]’s ambition to 
achieve the status of a superpower. But [[Israel]] can become a 
superpower only if it succeeds in establishing a hegemony over the 
entire Middle East. Meanwhile, there is one crucial difference 
between [[Israel]] and ‘the three big democracies’. The [[French]], for 
example, pay themselves for developing their own [[nuclear]] power. 
The development of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power is, by contrast, being 
financed by the US. Money for this purpose can be obtained only 
if [[Congress]] toes the line of the organized segment of the [[America]]n 
Jewish community and of its various allies. And in the process, the 
[[America]]n public must be effectively deceived about [[Israel]]’s real 
strategic aims. </p>
<p>The [[Israel]]i grand strategy has diverse strands. The task of 
blending them together into a single overarching concept was 
undertaken by General (Reserves) Shlomo Gazit in an article 
remarkable for its lucidity and forthrightness (Yediot Ahronot, 27 
[[April]]). Gazit is a former Military Intelligence commander who often 
explains in the media the strategic aims of the [[Israel]]i Security 
System, or else provides apologias for what the public tends to regard 
as its blunders or failures. His article has two avowed aims. The 
first, common also to several other prestigious [[Israel]]i press 
commentators writing at about the same time, is to convince the 
public that what ‘we used to hear for many years, almost since the 
birth of the State, about [[Israel]] as a strategic asset for the US and 
of the free world’, remains no less valid after the demise of the USSR 
and the termination of the Cold [[War]] than it had been before. Let 
me ignore a greater part of his historical presentation of how and 
why [[Israel]] could become so wonderful a strategic asset in the past, 
except for a single point which contains something new. The point </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 41 </p>
<p>is this: ‘[[Israel]] proposed to the [[America]]n armed forces that in the 
event of a war [with the USSR] it might provide the [[America]]ns 
with a variety of services, namely harbour, resupply, storage, 
medical [[treatment]] and hospitalization services.’ </p>
<p>However, Gazit admits that the value of [[Israel]]’s actually rendered 
services of the Cold [[War]] period ‘did dwindle, perhaps even 
completely, as [the US] no longer needs to be prepared for war 
with the [[Soviet]] bloc’. This became apparent ‘over a year ago, when 
the largest military force since World [[War]] II assembled during the 
Gulf [[War]] in our own region, in the very heart of the Middle East. 
[[Israel]] was ignored when this war was fought. Moreover, hope was 
expressed and concrete steps taken for the single aim of precluding 
[[Israel]]’s involvement in that war.’ Gazit even admits why it was so: 
“due to what from the [[Israel]]i point of view 1s a very sad but salient 
fact, namely that (with the possible exception of [[Egypt]] which had 
signed a peace [[treaty]] with us), no other Arab state can be a party 
to any military or security-aimed [[alliance]], if [[Israel]] is also a party 
to it.’ This was why, explains Gazit, ‘the [[Israel]]i Army was not actively 
involved in the war against Iraq’. This was why the armed forces 
of the anti-Iraqi coalition were not stationed on [[Israel]]i territory, as 
a result of ‘the Arab veto’. Expecting his readers to consequently 
ask, ‘What has still remained of [[Israel]]’s traditional role as a strategic 
asset, then?’, Gazit proceeds to lay bare the more decisive and lasting 
aspects of that role. </p>
<p>This is the second purpose of Gazit’s article, even more important 
than the first. He believes, correctly in my view, that [[Israel]] still 
remains a strategic asset as it was in the past. His lucid explanation 
deserves to be quoted extensively: ‘[[Israel]]’s main task has not 
changed at all, and it remains of crucial importance. The 
geographical location of [[Israel]] at the centre of the Arab-Muslim 
Middle East predestines [[Israel]] to be a devoted guardian of stability 
in all the countries surrounding it. Its [role] is to protect the existing 
regimes: to prevent or halt the processes of radicalization and to 
block the expansion of funda[[mental]]ist religious zealotry. [[Israel]] has 
its “red lines”, which have a powerful deterrent effect by virtue of 
causing uncertainty beyond its borders, precisely because they are 
not clearly marked nor explicitly defined. The purpose of these red 
lines is to determine which strategic developments or other changes 
occurring beyond [[Israel]]’s borders can be defined as threats which 
[[Israel]] itself will regard as intolerable to the point of being compelled 
to use all its military power for the sake of their prevention or 
eradication.’ In other words, the red lines are [[Israel]]i dictatorial 
ultimata imposed by it on all the other Middle [[Eastern]] states. </p>
<p>Gazit distinguishes ‘three kinds of developments’ among the 
processes of radicalization ‘which qualify as intolerable’ [to [[Israel]]]. 
The first category is constituted by acts of anti-[[Israel]]i terrorism </p>
<p>42 OPEN: SECRETS </p>
<p>originating from the territory of another state. Gazit is forthright 
enough to say that [[Israel]] retaliates against a given state not only in 
its own defence, but more in the best interest of an Arab [[government]] 
concerned: ‘An Arab [[government]] allowing a terrorist organization 
to run free, creates a monster which sooner or later will turn against 
it. If it does not take steps to halt any development hostile to itself 
and to re-establish its total control, it will eventually cease to rule 
its own country.’ </p>
<p>The second category of the red line is applied in case of ‘any entry 
of a foreign Arab military force on to the territory of a state which 
borders on [[Israel]], i.e. practically Jordan, Syria and [[Lebanon]].’ 
(Although [[Egypt]] borders on [[Israel]], it is not mentioned.) As in the 
previous case, Gazit is anxious to show that [[Israel]] has in such cases 
a benevolent concern for the stability of a given Arab regime: ‘An 
entry of a foreign Arab military force poses also a threat to the 
stability of the regime of the country thus affected, and sometimes 
also to the latter’s [[sovereignty]]. There can be no doubt, therefore, 
that the [[Israel]]i red line which deters and prevents entries of foreign 
Arab military forces to countries neighbouring with [[Israel]] 1s also 
a stabilizing factor which really protects the existing states and 
regimes in the entire Middle East.’ </p>
<p>The third category of the ‘red line’ is in Gazit’s view, and in mine 
as well, the most important. It is intended to preclude the 
developments which he defines as ‘threats of a revolt, whether 
military or popular, which may end up by bringing fanatical and 
extremist elements to power in states concerned. The existence of 
such threats has no connection with the Arab-[[Israel]]i conflict. hey 
exist because the regimes [of the region] find it difficult to offer 
solutions to their socio-economic ills. But any development of the 
described kind is apt to subvert the existing relations between 
[[Israel]] and this or that from among its neighbours. The prime 
examples of such a red line are concerns for the preservation of 
[[Israel]]’s peace [[treaty]] with [[Egypt]] and of the de facto peaceful 
cooperation between [[Israel]] and Jordan. In both cases it is [[Israel]]’s 
red lines which communicate to its neighbours that [[Israel]] will not 
tolerate anything that might encourage the extremist forces to go 
all the way, following in the footsteps of either the [[Iran]]ians to the 
east or the [[Algeria]]ns to the west.’ Gazit backs this statement by 
mentioning the [[Israel]]i intervention in defence of the Jordanian 
regime during the ‘Black [[September]]’ uprising of [[1970]]. He discussed 
more extensively the developments in [[Lebanon]] in the wake of the 
outbreak of the Civil [[War]] in [[1975]]: ‘When the Syrians were invited 
by some Maronites to intervene to stop the fighting and trounce 
the Muslims, they were at first deterred [by [[Israel]]] from advancing. 
When in the end the Syrian forces did advance, they clearly avoided 
anything which [[Israel]] could interpret as aberrant and thereby </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 43 </p>
<p>violating its red line.’ It is well known (at least in [[Israel]]), that 
Syrian advancement had culminated in the [[1976]] siege of Tel EI- 
Zaatar and the massacre of the Palestinians there. The massacre 
was perpetrated by Falangists supported by the Syrian army, with 
[[Israel]] fully approving. Senior [[Israel]]i Army officers were then spotted 
as observers in the Falangist camp, located in the vicinity of where 
the Syrian troops were stationed. </p>
<p>According to Gazit, however, this form of ‘[[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence’ may 
well extend beyond the Arab countries neighbouring with [[Israel]]: 
‘Indirectly, it also radiates on to all the other states of our region. 
In almost all of them, some kind of radicalization is going on, 
except that the radical forces are deterred from pushing all the way 
through out of fear that their maximalism might prompt [[Israel]] to 
respond. Although no one would say so openly, I am positive that 
the regime of [[President]] Mubarak benefits from such an [[Israel]]i 
deterrence. If power [in [[Egypt]]] is ever seized by Islamic extremists, 
they will at once have to decide whether to recognize the peace [[treaty]] 
with [[Israel]] as binding or not. It will be a most difficult decision for 
them. If they do recognize the [[treaty]], they will compromise their 
own ideology. And if they don’t recognize it, they will at once have 
a war for which they cannot possibly be ready.’ </p>
<p>In Gazit’s view, by virtue of protecting all or most Middle [[Eastern]] 
regimes, [[Israel]] performs a vital service for ‘the industrially advanced 
states, all of which are keenly concerned with guaranteeing the 
stability in the Middle East’. He speculates that without [[Israel]], the 
regimes of the region would have collapsed long ago. He concludes, 
‘In the aftermath of the disappearance of the USSR as a political 
power with interests of its own in the region a number of Middle 
[[Eastern]] states lost a patron guaranteeing their political, military and 
economic viability. A vacuum was thus created, adding to the 
region’s instability. Under such conditions the [[Israel]]i role as a 
strategic asset guaranteeing a modicum of stability in the entire 
Middle East did not dwindle or disappear but was elevated to the 
first order of magnitude. Without [[Israel]], the West would have to 
perform this role by itself, when none of the existing superpowers 
really could perform it, because of various domestic and 
international constraints. For [[Israel]], by contrast, the need to 
intervene is a matter of survival.’ </p>
<p>Let me recall in this context several facts of crucial importance. 
First, that speaking in the context of possible uses of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] 
power, Brosh revealed that [[Israel]] has contingency plans to be 
applied if ‘the [[Egypt]]ian regime may change’ or because ‘the [[Saudi]] 
royal family will not reign forever’. By comparing Gazit with Brosh, 
we can grasp better the nature of [[Israel]]i strategic aims. [[Israel]] is 
preparing for a war, [[nuclear]] if need be, for the sake of averting 
domestic change not to its liking, if it occurs in some or any Middle </p>
<p>44 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[Eastern]] states. At some time after the fall of the Shah it was 
disclosed that in the last days of his regime the [[Israel]]i Army planned 
to dispatch its elite units to Tehran in order to relieve the hard- 
pressed [[Iran]]ian generals, except that Begin, in a display of relative 
moderation refused to okay the venture. </p>
<p>However, as Gazit rightly points out, the USSR collapsed. As 
long as it existed, it was a strategic factor of prime importance, 
because threat of [[Soviet]] intervention was to some extent deterring 
[[Israel]] from a direct and undisguised pursuit of hegemony over the 
entire Middle East. Now, as Gazir rightly observes, ‘a vacuum was 
created’ which neither the US nor any other ‘industrially advanced 
state’ can fill up, at least in Gazit’s sense of the term. No faraway 
power will in the foreseeable future be able to invade a Middle 
[[Eastern]] state, while using or threatening to use its [[nuclear]] arms in 
the process, only because it would dislike a domestic radicalization 
occurring within the internationally recognized borders of that 
state. Let us recall that even when Iraq persisted in its annexation 
of Kuwait, [[Bush]] could obtain only a slim majority in the US 
[[Congress]] in favour of opening the Gulf [[War]]. Can [[Congress]] be 
envisioned to approve an invasion of a Middle [[Eastern]] state in a 
mere response to a popular [[revolution]] there? The answer cannot 
but be either categorically negative, or at least anticipative of nearly 
unsurmountable obstacles that the US or any other [[Western]] power 
would in such a case have to cope with. There can be no doubt 
that in [[Israel]], where even the Knesset doesn’t need to be consulted 
before an armed aggression, no analogous obstacles exist. The 
[[Israel]]i [[government]] has the legal right to initiate a war, and it can 
be certain of an initial approval for it by a huge majority of the Jewish 
public, regardless of circumstances under which that war breaks 
out. In the past, whenever the Knesset was notified of an aggressive 
war already in progress, it would approve it enthusiastically, by a 
huge majority. </p>
<p>Knesset ratifications of the already ongoing wars actually occurred 
in [[1967]] and in [[1982]]. But the best example of it, allowing us to probe 
deeper into the pattern of the Knesset’s behaviour, 1s its ratification 
of the Suez [[War]] in [[1956]]. After Ben-Gurion told the Knesset, on 
the third day of the war, that the war’s purpose was ‘to re-establish 
the kingdom of David and Solomon’ by annexing Sinai, our 
ancestral [[property]] ‘which is not a part of [[Egypt]]’, as well as to 
liberate the [[Egypt]]ians and the whole world from the tyranny of 
Nasser, the entire Knesset, with the exception of the four 
Communist MKs, got up and stood to attention to sing the [[Israel]]i 
national anthem. Only threats from Khrushchev and from 
Eisenhower eventually convinced Ben-Gurion to reverse himself 
on this score. Yet Ben-Gurion was a realist and he ruled over the 
Army with an iron fist. </p>
<p>ISRAEL’S STRATEGIC AIMS AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS 45 </p>
<p>Under the new conditions of ‘a vacuum [which] was created’ by 
the demise of the USSR, and by the increasing vulnerability of the 
US, [[Israel]] clearly prepares itself to seek overtly a hegemony over 
the entire Middle East which it has always sought covertly, without 
hesitating to use for the purpose all means available, including 
[[nuclear]] ones. Contrary to what Gazit, Shuval or other [[Israel]]i 
spokesmen say, however, this venture is not being undertaken for 
the sake of benefiting the West. The West is comprised primarily 
of Gentiles, and [[Israel]] is a Jewish state whose sole purpose is to 
benefit Jews alone. [[Israel]]’s search for hegemony stems from its own 
time-honoured ambitions which now dictate its strategic aims. </p>
<p>Syrian Cities and Relations with 
Saddam Hussein 
24 [[September]] [[1991]] </p>
<p>Numerous translations of mine from the Hebrew press envision, 
from time to time, a ‘pre-emptive’ [[Israel]]i war as likely and as 
directed against Syria, which has been long regarded by [[Israel]] as 
its enemy number one. Particularly relevant in this context is the 
18 [[February]] [[1991]] speech by Yitzhak Rabin (as the head of 
opposition) to the Labor Knesset faction. Rabin’s speech contained 
three crucial points. The first point was that [[Israel]] was doomed to 
live forever in war, or under the threat of war with the entire Arab 
world, but at this point of time especially with Syria. The second 
was that in all its wars [[Israel]] ‘must assume an essentially aggressive 
role, so as to be in the position to dictate the terms of a conclusion’. 
Prerequisite to that is ‘a further increase of the offensive power of 
[[Israel]]i Air and Armour forces needed to achieve a quick victory’. 
The third was Rabin’s criticism of Arens (then the Defence Minister) 
for letting Iraqi [[missile]]s hit [[Israel]]: “What had we told them [the 
Arabs]? If you send [[missile]]s on Tel Aviv, Damascus will be turned 
into aruin. If you send [[missile]]s also on Haifa, not only Damascus 
but also Aleppo will cease to exist. They will be destroyed root and 
branch. Without dealing only with [[missile]] launchers, we will 
devastate Damascus.’ Various [[Israel]]i commentators, e.g. Uzi 
Benziman and Reuven Padatzur of [[Haaretz]] and Ya’akov Sharett 
of Davar, understood these words as intended to mean that [[Israel]] 
had already threatened Syria (and other Arab countries as well) with 
obliteration of its cities by [[nuclear]] weapons. </p>
<p>Here I will describe what probably was the first instance when 
the highest [[Israel]]i authorities actually contemplated the razing of 
four Syrian cities: Damascus, Aleppo, Homs and Latakia. The story 
which occurred during the [[October]] [[1973]] [[War]] is documented by 
Yigal Sarna (Yediot Ahronot, 17 [[September]] [[1991]]). Sarna’s facts are 
based on extensive documentation supplied by Aryeh Brown, the 
then military secretary of the Defence Minister, Moshe Dayan. 
Sarna’s article contains an interview with Brown who defines 
himself as ‘loyal to Dayan, and trusting his judgement fully, both </p>
<p>46 </p>
<p>SYRIAN CITIES AND SADDAM HUSSEIN 47 </p>
<p>during that war and on other occasions’. Significantly, Brown also 
says that he owed his quick rise in rank to Dayan. </p>
<p>Sarna’s article appeared on the Eve of Yom Kippur when analyses 
of the [[1973]] Yom Kippur [[War]] are customarily published by the 
Hebrew press. I find it significant that no other [[Israel]]i war, such 
as the [[War]] of Independence and the Six Day [[War]], duly 
commemorated as they are, receive even a fraction of printed space 
which the [[history]] of the [[1973]] [[War]] continues to receive. Sarna 
himself fought in that war as a tank commander on the Syrian front. 
As for Sarna’s personal attitude, he says that together with ‘a whole 
generation of [[Israel]]is, then traumatized to the core’, he has since 
that war ‘acquired a split personality with half of it remaining in 
the past and the second half facing the future’. This can mean that 
the attitudes of the entire generation then changed. As Sarna says, 
that generation ‘now passes on the emotions then learned to their 
sons’. All [[Israel]]i politics from [[1973]] can best be understood as a 
reaction to the Yom Kippur [[War]]. That reaction, however, may 
assume antithetical directions. </p>
<p>The personality of Moshe Dayan needs to be taken into account 
here. I have always been very critical of Dayan, but I think that 
whatever can be said of his politics, there can be little doubt that, 
while the [[Israel]]i grand strategy precedes his time, he was also a 
master tactician, who invented the [[Israel]]i Army’s doctrine of 
deterrence, along with other tactical innovations which still largely 
determine the [[Israel]]i Army’s strategies and tactics, but above 
everything else in its attitudes towards the Arabs. Just before 
[[October]] [[1973]] Dayan was at the peak of his popularity, not only in 
[[Israel]] but also among the diaspora Jews. His popularity rested in 
my view mainly on his radiant confidence that [[Israel]] could retain 
the [[Territories]] [[conquer]]ed in that war indefinitely. He argued that 
the the Arab states either would not dare attack [[Israel]], or, if they 
did, their resounding defeat after a short war was assured. </p>
<p>Already on the second day of the Yom Kippur [[War]] (7 [[October]]), 
however, Dayan together with all other [[Israel]]i leaders realized that 
the war was going badly, with all their hopes for a rapid victory 
dashed. As Brown recounts, they nevertheless kept pretending to 
the [[Israel]]is as well as to the whole world (including their friend 
Henry Kissinger) that everything was going on according to the 
[[Israel]]i Army’s plans. (A major carrier of this deception was Hayim 
Herzog, then the chief TV commentator and now [[President]] of the 
state.) The deception only aggravated the situation. </p>
<p>As Brown recounts it, on 7 [[October]], at 11:45 a.m., ‘Moshe 
Dayan and his chief military adviser General Rehavam Ze’evi (now 
the leader of the transfer-advocating Moledet (‘Fatherland’) party) 
already recognized the full dimensions of the [[[Israel]]i] defeat.’ They 
came to this recognition in spite of being misinformed by some </p>
<p>48 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>generals, especially the commander of the [[South]]ern Command 
responsible for the Suez front, Gonen (alias Gorodish) who ‘kept 
reporting favourable developments only’. Shortly afterwards Dayan 
reported his conclusions to several [[Israel]]i ministers and then to 
Prime Minister Golda Meir. The next day (8 [[October]]), counter- 
attacks by fresh [[Israel]]i forces, were, according to Brown, ‘predicated 
on the Air Force’s false reports of smashing successes’. No wonder 
the counter-attacks ended up in another defeat, more decisive 
than the defeats of the previous day. Although at the session of the 
[[Israel]]i [[government]] held on the evening of that day Dayan did not 
reveal the extent of the defeat, he was well aware of it. On a piece 
of paper guarded by Brown he sketched guidelines to be followed 
during the next several days. After summarizing the adversities on 
the [[Egypt]]ian front he wrote there: ‘Everything possible should be 
done to terminate fighting on the [[North]]ern [Syrian] front at once, 
so that we have only one [the [[Egypt]]ian] front to cope with.’ He 
decided to discuss this with the Chief of Staff, David Elazar. Next 
morning he met senior officers to whom he presented another 
argument for terminating the war against Syria ‘at once’: ‘I expect 
traumatic reactions when the [[Israel]]is discover the truth.’ As 
subsequent developments showed, in this respect Dayan was a good 
prophet. Possibly, the crucial consideration underlying his 
subsequent decisions was to prevent [[Israel]]is from learning the truth. </p>
<p>‘At the meeting [with senior officers]’, continues Sarna, 
‘Instructions were drafted which even Brown considered devoid of 
all precedent.’ In addition to orders to [[Israel]]i troops fighting the 
Syrians on the ground to destroy the Syrian Army without regard 
for their own casualties, they also included ‘the orders to find out 
by any means, including the most bizarre ones, what could be done’ 
in order to defeat the Syrians rapidly. Brown explains to Sarna that 
‘it was Dayan who first advanced the idea that Syria must be 
crushed to pieces. When he talked about “the bizarre means”, he 
meant to stress that anything was conceivable ... In the diaries of 
Brown from that time, the word “Damascus” from that moment 
onward begins to appear very frequently. Dayan, the Chief of 
Staff, the commander of the Air Force, all talked about Damascus. 
“We must smash Syria within the next 24 hours”, said the Chief 
of Staff to the ac[[company]]ing officers. “We have 400 tanks now 
fighting like hell. Therefore the Syrian cities of Damascus, Aleppo, 
Homs and Latakia should be obliterated. I must do something 
dramatic enough to make Syria cry ‘Whoah!’, to make them beg 
us ‘Please stop firing!’ For that purpose I need something that will 
deprive them of all electricity, destroy all their power stations, and 
scorch their earth”’’. </p>
<p>But in order to use such ‘bizarre means’, [[Israel]]i generals needed 
an authorization by civilian authorities. The next day Dayan, </p>
<p>SYRIAN CITIES AND SADDAM HUSSEIN 49 </p>
<p>accompanied by Yigal Alon [a renowned Palmach commander in 
[[1948]] and former Foreign Minister] ‘who backed him’, held an early 
morning meeting with Golda Meir. Sarna does not know what 
transpired there, except for the outcome. No permission to use 
‘bizarre means’ was granted. Instead, ‘the Air Force was instructed 
by the Chief of Staff “to smash Syria”’ by conventional means. The 
[[government]] which met later that day was informed that during the 
air raid on Damascus taking place simultaneously, ‘all targets had 
already been hit’. Only after the ministers dispersed, a report 
arrived ‘that only some targets had been hit, among them the 
[[Soviet]] cultural center’. Damascus was not obliterated by 
conventional means. The Air Force attributed its failure ‘to 
heavy cloud’. </p>
<p>At this point Sarna’s narrative breaks for about seven to eight 
days. This may be due either to Brown’s reluctance to talk or to a 
censorship ban. Judging by references to events on the Syrian 
front, the narrative resumes from 15-16 [[October]]. By then, [[Israel]]i 
commanders, instead of working alone as they did at the beginning 
of the war, were working in close coordination with Henry Kissinger. 
The planning aimed no longer at obliterating Damascus (other 
Syrian cities were no longer even mentioned), but at besieging or 
[[conquer]]ing it. Only some of the generals demanded sterner 
measures. The idea animating everybody was to conclude the war 
by a great victory in the style of the Six Day [[War]], but on a 
larger scale. </p>
<p>One [[October]] night Dayan wrote an instruction: ‘I plan complete 
destruction of the Syrian army. If Damascus can be [[conquer]]ed, its 
conquest should be considered ... Our entry into Damascus could 
balance our retreat from the [Suez] Canal.’ Next morning ‘the Chief 
of Staff asked for a [[missile]] of 40-km range to be launched on to 
Damascus. Dayan rejected that request.” We can make the 
conjecture that the [[missile]] which the Chief of Staff requested was 
not meant to have a conventional warhead. Then Dayan went to 
the command of General Rafael Eitan on the Syrian front to tell 
him: ‘Our aim is to reach Damascus. The conduct of the war 
depends on our ability to reach Damascus ... We should proceed 
toward it, attacking on a narrow front, and [then] make an assault 
on the city, so that they will be forced to beg us to refrain from 
[[conquer]]ing it.’ Eitan is recorded by Brown as promising Dayan that 
Damascus would soon be [[conquer]]ed and as issuing the requisite 
orders at once, while Dayan watched to see what would follow: 
‘After two hours the spearhead of the advancing Armour brigade 
commanded by General! Lerner, reported having been hit by a Synan 
anti-tank force. The Syrians awaited the [[Israel]]is in ambush and 
inflicted heavy casualties. Yet Dayan continued to think about the 
conquest of Damascus.’ After several hours, when Lerner’s brigade </p>
<p>50 OPEN SECR&amp;TS </p>
<p>retreated and began reassembling, ‘Dayan radioed Lerner: “I want 
to tell you that if you reach the gates of Damascus with speed you 
will vindicate our loss of the [Suez] Canal.” At the same time, 
however, he received a report from the Chief of Staff: “I cannot 
reach Damascus.” Dayan answered: “I now want to reach the 
vicinity of Damascus, rather than the city itseif. It will suffice if they 
say to the [[Russia]]ns: “Help us to get rid of the Jews’”.’ </p>
<p>Yet the same day Dayan promised Golda Meir to either [[conquer]] 
Damascus or at least reach its outskirts, and he repeated this at a 
[[government]] meeting. Then he went to the generals commanding 
the Syrian front, telling them: ‘Our troops need to advance no more 
than 5 or 7 km. From there we can reach Damascus which lies at 
the distance of only 25 km. further. This can be accomplished easily 
enough.’ What he apparently expected was that after an initial 
offensive the Syrian Army would break apart and run away, in the 
same way as the [[Egypt]]ian Army had done in [[1967]]. In fact, his (and 
his generals’) reasoning relied entirely on folk psychology: on their 
own preconceptions about ‘Arab [[mental]]ity’. Theirs was a ‘strategy 
based on the presumed psychology of the Arabs’. This strategy 
prevailed at the same meeting, when the commander of the Air 
Force, Benny Peled, proposed that Damascus be [[bomb]]ed from the 
air rather than [[conquer]]ed. Dayan responded: “The Syrians know 
that aircraft sows destruction but cannot [[conquer]]. But if we shell 
them with artillery, they will feel that we are about to [[conquer]] the 
city soon.’ </p>
<p>But another factor also played its role. Brown records that “the 
State Secretary [Kissinger] instantly receives the reports of all the 
movements of the [[Israel]]i troops. He is deliberately staying the 
political process in order to enable [[Israel]] to negotiate later from a 
more advantageous position. Kissinger is certain that Damascus 
will be [[conquer]]ed, to the point of having quipped to Dinitz [[[Israel]]i 
Ambassador in the US]: “As soon as you reach the suburbs of 
Damascus, all you will need for the rest is the public transport’”’. 
He said it ‘ten days before the end of the war’. It was due to his 
interaction with Kissinger that Dayan insisted on ‘the conquest of 
Damascus within a few days’. </p>
<p>The role of Begin, then head of the [[Israel]]i opposition, was 
downright comical. Prompted by ‘the phone calls I keep getting 
from Sharon at the [[[Egypt]]ian] front’, Begin told Dayan that the 
conquest of Damascus was imperative ‘for the sake of liberating 
the Syrian Jews’. (He apparently meant those who would survive 
the [[bomb]]ing of Damascus.) Dayan dismissed him courteously. 
Dayan was still so sure that Damascus could at the very least be 
besieged by the [[Israel]]i forces that ‘he began to worry about what 
might happen to those forces in the vicinity of Damascus during 
the entire rainy season’, i.e. the winter. </p>
<p>SYRIAN CITIES AND SADDAM HUSSEIN 5} </p>
<p>Sarna, who served all that time at the front, records that the aim 
of [[conquer]]ing Damascus was passed on to the troops. ‘In fact, the 
[[[Israel]]i] forces in the Golan Heights were already exhausted and 
unable to break through the [Syrian] defence lines separating them 
from Damascus. Still, the goal of [[conquer]]ing Damascus raised the 
morale of the troops, their faith in the continuous attack and their 
ability to be always able to advance toward designated targets’. Yet 
he reflects: ‘I now think that distances on the Chief of Staffs maps 
must have seemed short compared to the slowness of our advances 
and to the scale of our casualties in human lives and also in armour 
which we suffered for each of 100 meters we have traversed ... As 
a tankist advancing on “a narrow front” towards Damascus, I 
recall how distant we were from the city, how dispirited while 
watching their defence lines, how worn out by their continuous 
mortar shelling of our night encampments. The attempt to [[conquer]] 
Damascus was unreal but at the same time it was essential because 
it restored our morale after our war-machine broke down’. This is 
indeed a telling testimony of ignorance of the [[Israel]]i warlords 
about the conditions their own soldiers were fighting under. To 
all appearances, that ignorance has deepened since. </p>
<p>Sarna’s story is ominous because the funda[[mental]] aims of the 
[[Israel]]i army top commanders can be presumed to remain the same 
and the folk psychology guiding their decisions can be presumed 
not to have changed either. The ideas of fighting Syria with [[nuclear]] 
weapons are unlikely to have been discarded. The recourse to 
[[nuclear]] weapons on [[Israel]]’s part, whether for the sake of obliterating 
the four mentioned Syrian cities or of Damascus alone seems to 
have been prevented in [[1973]] by the opposition of Golda Meir and 
Henry Kissinger, both of whom preferred [[Israel]] to [[conquer]] 
Damascus by conventional means. </p>
<p>Past contacts between [[Israel]] and Saddam Hussein 
10 [[November]] [[1990]] </p>
<p>In the middle of the present Gulf crisis it is worth recalling that 
until a few months ago Saddam Hussein persistently offered to 
make peace with [[Israel]] on the latter’s terms. One of his attempts 
took place about a year ago. The then Defence Minister, Yitzhak 
Rabin, was during one of his visits to the US then approached 
with an offer that he meet Saddam Hussein. Information to this 
effect appeared in two articles by the senior strategy and military 
correspondent of [[Haaretz]], Ze’ev Shiff, who in matters of historical 
fact can be considered quite reliable ([[Haaretz]], 5 and 6 [[November]] 
[[1990]]). Interestingly, Rabin refused to either confirm or deny the </p>
<p>52 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>revelations, after [[Haaretz]] accorded them publicity by printing 
them on its front page. </p>
<p>The middleman chosen by Saddam Hussein was ‘an [[America]]n 
businessman of Arab descent ... Bob Abud. At present he is the 
president of the First City Bank of Texas. In the past he presided 
over the oil [[company]] owned by the multi-millionaire Armand 
Hammer ... He is 62, well-known for his good relations with some 
heads of Arab states, for whom he arranges personal loans on easy 
terms. He also maintains good relations with the Arab-[[America]]n 
community. After twelve years of heading Hammer’s oil [[company]] 
‘Occidental Petroleum’, he became president of a Chicago bank’, 
where ‘he developed an interest in advancing the cause of peace 
between I[srael and the Arab states’ (Shiff, 6 [[November]]). It is not 
irrelevant to note that Armand Hammer, who is Jewish, has for many 
years been a fervent [[Israel]] supporter, a generous contributor to 
[[United]] Jewish Appeal [of the US] and a major investor in [[Israel]], 
in addition to being used by [[Israel]]i diplomacy as a middleman in 
political ventures, for example arranging the immigration of [[Soviet]] 
Jews to [[Israel]] through his contacts with top [[Soviet]] leaders. </p>
<p>As Shiff reports it (5 [[November]]) the offer was made by Saddam 
Hussein, who proposed through Abud ‘to meet with Yitzhak Rabin, 
then [[[Israel]]i] Defence minister. The dates of two meetings, to be 
held in [[Europe]] were already fixed, although the Iraqis requested 
to reschedule them. A secret meeting between Rabin and the 
middleman was held in Philadelphia.’ According to Shiff, Abud, 
‘was held by the [[Israel]]is in respect, as somebody with useful 
connections. Considering this, Rabin expressed his desire to meet 
him in order to hear directly about the Iraqi proposal.’ Prior to 
meeting Rabin, Mr Abud met several times ‘an [[Israel]]i businessman 
living most of his time abroad, Azriel Einav’, known for having good 
connections within the [[Israel]]i Defence Ministry and other 
components of the [[Israel]]i Security System. When those meetings 
proved successful and the consent of Rabin to establish contacts 
with Saddam Hussein was obtained, an in[[flu]]ential aide and personal 
friend of Rabin, Eytan Haber ‘was appointed as a go-between in 
charge of arranging the meetings’ of Rabin with Saddam Hussein. 
When confronted by Shiff with the evidence, Haber responded that 
““something like that” had indeed occured’, but refused to provide 
any further information. </p>
<p>The Philadelphia meeting of Abud with Rabin was held when 
the latter attended the opening of an [[Israel]]i Bonds convention in 
that city. Haber and the military secretary of Rabin, Kuti Mor were 
present during a part of the meeting with Abud. To prevent the 
press from noticing the meetings, Mr Abud ‘entered the hotel 
through the kitchen door and proceeded to Rabin’s suite by a 
service elevator’. On the agenda was, first, ‘the proposal [of Saddam </p>
<p>SYRIAN CITIES AND SADDAM HUSSEIN ei) </p>
<p>Hussein] to meet in order to talk about reconciling the interests of 
the two states’, and, the second, means of averting an [[Israel]]i attack 
on Iraq which was rumoured to be under preparation: ‘Rabin 
accepted the proposal to meet Saddam Hussein at a location to be 
determined, ur rejected the. proposal to include a PLO 
[[representative]] during part of these talks.’ After this agreement, Mr 
Abud suggested in the name of Saddam Hussein, that ‘Rabin may 
be invited to a meeting in Baghdad’, instead of a meeting in [[Europe]]. 
There is no information about how Rabin responded to this 
interesting suggestion, except that he ‘opined that all leads toward 
peace with all the Arab states deserve to be examined’. </p>
<p>Contacts between [[Israel]] and Iraq and the timing of various 
meetings were negotiated and renegotiated by [[Israel]] and Iraq 
through the above mentioned go-between during several subsequent 
months, ‘but when the tension between [[[Israel]]] and Iraq began to 
mount after Saddam Hussein’s speech at the last [[February]]’s 
conference of the Council for Economic Cooperation between 
[[Egypt]], Iraq, Jordan and Yemen, the idea of meeting was shelved’, 
apparently by [[Israel]]. Shiff (5 [[November]]) writes in conclusion: 
‘Supposedly, the [[America]]n businessman was reporting all the 
details of the negotiations to the White House.’ </p>

<p>[[Israel]] versus [[Iran]] 
24 [[February]] [[1993]] </p>
<p>Since the spring of [[1992]] public opinion in [[Israel]] is being prepared 
for the prospect of a war with [[Iran]], to be fought to bring about [[Iran]]’s 
total military and political defeat. In one version, [[Israel]] would 
attack [[Iran]] alone, in another it would ‘persuade’ the West to do 
the job. The indoctrination campaign to this effect is gaining in 
intensity. It is accompanied by what could be called semi-official 
horror scenarios purporting to detail what [[Iran]] could do to [[Israel]], 
the West and the entire world when it acquires [[nuclear]] weapons 
as it is expected to a few years hence. A manipulation of public 
opinion to this effect may well be considered too phantasmagoric 
to merit any detailed description. Still, the readers should take 
notice, especially since to all appearances the [[Israel]]i Security 
System does envisage the prospect seriously. In [[February]] [[1993]] 
minutely-detailed anticipations of [[Iran]] becoming a major target 
of [[Israel]]i policies became intense. I am going to confine myself to 
a sample of recent publications (in view of the monotony of their 
contents it will suffice), emphasizing how they envisage the 
possibility of ‘persuading’ the West that [[Iran]] must be defeated. All 
Hebrew papers have shared in advocacy of this madness, with 
exception of [[Haaretz]] which has not dared to challenge it either. 
The Zionist ‘left’? papers, Davar and Al Hamishmar have particularly 
distinguished themselves in bellicosity on the subject of [[Iran]]; more 
so than the right-wing Maanv. Below, I will concentrate on the 
recent writings of Al Hamishmar and Maariv about [[Iran]], only 
occasionally mentioning what I found in other papers. </p>
<p>A major article by the political correspondent of Al Hamishmar, 
Yo’av Kaspi bears the title that summarizes its contents: ‘[[Iran]] 
needs to be treated just as Iraq had been’ (19 [[February]] [[1993]]). The 
article contains an interview with Daniel Leshem, introduced as 
‘a retired senior officer in the [[[Israel]]i] Military Intelligence, now 
member of the Centre for Strategic [[Research]] at the Tel Aviv 
University’. Leshem is known to be involved in forming [[Israel]]i 
strategies. His account of how [[Iran]] is going to [[nuclear]]ize is too 
dubious to merit coverage here as are his lamentations that ‘the 
world’ has been ignoring the warnings of the [[Israel]]i experts who </p>
<p>54 </p>
<p>ISRAEL VERSUS IRAN Bp) </p>
<p>alone know all the truth about what the Muslim states are like. 
However, his proposals for the reversal of the progress of [[Iran]]ian 
[[nuclear]]ization are by all means worth of being reported. Leshem 
begins by opining that the Allied air raids had very little success in 
destroying Iraq’s military and especially [[nuclear]] capabilities, but, 
owing to Allied victory on the ground, UN observers could succeed 
in finishing the job. Harping on this ‘analogy’, Leshem concludes: 
‘[[Israel]] alone can do very little to halt the [[Iran]]ians. We could raid 
[[Iran]] from the air, but we cannot realistically expect that our aerial 
operations could destroy all their capabilities. At best, some [[Iran]]ian 
[[nuclear]] installations could in this way be destroyed. But we couldn’t 
reach their major centres of [[nuclear]] development, since that 
development has proceeded along three different lines in a fairly 
decentralized manner, with installations and factories scattered 
widely across the country. It is even reasonable to suppose that we 
will never know the locations of all their installations, just as we 
didn’t know in Iraq’s case.’ </p>
<p>Hence Leshem believes that [[Israel]] should make [[Iran]] fear [[Israel]]i 
[[nuclear]] weapons, but without hoping that it might deter it from 
developing their own; he proposes ‘to create the situation which 
would appear similar to that with Iraq before the Gulf crisis’. He 
believes this could ‘stop the Ayatollahs, if this is what the world 
really wants’. How to do it? ‘[[Iran]] claims [[sovereignty]] over three 
strategically located islands in the Gulf. Domination over those 
islands is capable of assuring domination not only over all the 
already active oilfields of the area, but also over all the natural gas 
sources not yet exploited. We should hope that, emulating Iraq, 
[[Iran]] would contest the Gulf [[Emirates]] and [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] over these 
islands and, repeating Saddam Hussein’s mistake in Kuwait, start 
a war. This may lead to an imposition of controls over [[Iran]]ian 
[[nuclear]] developments the way it did in Iraq. This prospect is in 
my view quite likely, because patience plays no part in the [[Iran]]ian 
[[mental]]ity. But if they nevertheless refrain from starting a war, we 
should take advantage of their involvement in Islamic terrorism 
which already hurts the entire world. [[Israel]] has incontestable 
intelligence that the [[Iran]]ians are terrorists. We should take advantage 
of this by persistently explaining to the world at large that by virtue 
of its involvement in terrorism, no other state is as dangerous to 
the entire world as [[Iran]]. I cannot comprehend why [[Libya]] has been 
hit by sanctions, to the point that sales of military equipment are 
barred to it because of its minor involvement in terrorism; while 
[[Iran]], with its record of guiding terrorism against the entire world 
remains entirely free of even stricter sanctions.’ In true-blue [[Israel]]i 
style, Leshem attributes this lamentable state of affairs to [[Israel]]’s 
neglect of its propaganda (called ‘Hasbara’, that is, Explanation’). </p>
<p>56 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>He nevertheless hopes that [[Israel]] will soon be able ‘to explain to 
the world at large’ how urgent is the need to provoke [[Iran]] to a war. </p>
<p>Provoking [[Iran]] into responding with war or measures just 
stopping short of war, is also elaborated by many other 
commentators. Let me just quote a story published by Telem 
Admon in Maanv (12 [[February]]) who reports that ‘a senior [[Israel]]i’, 
that is, a senior Mossad agent, ‘about two weeks ago had a long 
conversation with the son of the late Shah, Prince Riza Sha’a 
Pahlevi’ in order to appraise the man’s possible usefulness for 
[[Israel]]i ‘Hasbara’. In the ‘senior’s’ opinion, ‘[[Clinton]]’s [[America]] is 
too absorbed in its domestic affairs’, and as a result ‘the prince’s 
chances of reigning in [[Iran]] are deplorably slim. The prince’s face 
showed signs of distress after he heard a frank assessment to this 
effect from the mouth of an [[Israel]]i.’ Yet the ‘senior’s’ appraisal of 
the prince was distinctly negative, in spite of ‘the princely routine 
of handing to all visitors copies of articles by Ehud Ya’ari’ (an [[Israel]]i 
television commentator suspected of being a front for [[Israel]]i 
Intelligence). Why? In the first place because ‘the prince shows how 
nervous he is. His knees jerked during the first half-hour of the 
conversation.’ Worse still, his chums ‘were dressed like hippies’ while 
‘he kept frequenting [[Manhattan]]’s haunts in their [[company]] and 
addressing them as if they were his equals’. The ‘senior’ deplores 
it greatly that the prince has emancipated himself from the beneficial 
in[[flu]]ence of his mother, ‘who had done a simply wonderful job 
travelling from capital to capital in order to impress everybody 
concerned with her hope to enthrone her son in [[Iran]] while she 1s 
still alive’. Her valiant efforts look to me as connected, to some extent 
at least, to the no-less-valiant efforts of the [[Israel]]i ‘Hasbara’ before 
it had written off her son. </p>
<p>But what might happen if both [[Israel]] and [[Iran]] have [[nuclear]] 
weapons? This question is being addressed by the Hebrew press 
at length, often in a manner intended to titillate the reader with 
anticipated horrors. Let me give a small sample. In Al Hamishmar 
(19 [[February]]), Kaspi interviewed the notorious ‘hawk’, Professor 
Shlomo Aharonson, who begins his perorations by excoriating the 
[[Israel]]i left as a major obstacle to [[Israel]]’s ability to resist [[Iran]]ian 
evildoing. Without bothering about the left’s current lack of political 
clout, says Aharonson: “The left is full of prejudices and fears. It 
refuses to be rational on the [[nuclear]] issue. The left doesn’t like 
[[nuclear]] weapons, full stop. The opposition of the [[Israel]]i left to 
[[nuclear]] weapons is reminiscent of the opposition to the invention 
of the wheel.’ Profound insights, aren’t they? After spelling them 
out, Aharonson proceeds to his ‘scenarios’. Here is just one of them: 
‘If we established tomorrow a Palestinian state, we will really grant 
a [[sovereignty]] to an entity second to none in hostility toward us. 
This entity can be expected to reach a [[nuclear]] [[alliance]] with [[Iran]] </p>
<p>ISRAEL VERSUS IRAN 57 </p>
<p>at once. Suppose the Palestinians open hostilities against us and 
the [[Iran]]ians deter us from retaliating against the Palestinians by 
threatening to retaliate in turn against us by [[nuclear]] means. What 
could we do then?’ There is a lot more in the same vein before 
Aharonson concludes: ‘We should see to it that no Palestinian state 
ever comes into being, even if [[Iran]]ians threaten us with [[nuclear]] 
weapons. And we should also see to it that [[Iran]] lives in permanent 
fear of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] weapons being used against it.’ </p>
<p>Let me reiterate that the [[Israel]]is are also [[bomb]]arded ceaselessly 
with official messages to the same effect. For example, General Ze’ev 
Livneh, the commander of recently established Rear General 
Command of the [[Israel]]i Army said (in [[Haaretz]], 15 [[February]]) that 
‘it is not only [[Iran]] which already endangers every site in [[Israel]]’, 
because, even if to a lesser extent, Syria, [[Libya]] and [[Algeria]] do too’. 
In order to protect [[Israel]] from this danger, General Livneh calls 
upon ‘the [[Europe]]an Community to enforce jointly with [[Israel]] an 
embargo on any weaponry supplies to both [[Iran]] and those Arab 
states. The EC should also learn that military interventions can have 
salutary effects, as proven recently 1n Iraq’s case.’ </p>
<p>Timid reminders by the Hebrew press that [[Israel]] continues to 
have the monopoly of [[nuclear]] weapons in the Middle East, were 
definitely unwelcome to [[Israel]]i authorities. In Hadashot of 29 [[January]] 
and 5 [[February]], Ran Edelist, careful to rely only on quotes from 
the US press, raised the problem of [[nuclear]] waste disposal from 
the rather obsolete Dimona reactor and of other possible risks of 
that reactor to [[Israel]]i lives and limbs. He was ‘answered’ by 
numerous interviews with named and unnamed experts, all of 
whom fiercely denied that any such risks existed. The experts 
didn’t neglect to reassure their readers that the [[Israel]]i reactor was 
the best and the safest in the entire world. But speaking in the name 
of ‘the Intelligence Community’ Immanuel Rosen (Maariv, 
12 [[February]]) went even further. He disclosed that the said 
‘community’ felt offended ‘by the self-confident publications of an 
[[Israel]]i [[research]]er dealing with [[nuclear]] subjects. This [[research]]er has 
recently been found by the Intelligence Community to pose “a 
security risk’’, to the point of observing that in some states such a 
[[research]]er “would have been made to disappear”.’ Ran Edelist 
reacted in a brief note (in Hadashot, 14 [[February]]), confining himself 
to quoting these revealing ideas of ‘the Intelligence Community’, 
and drawing attention to threats voiced there. But apart from 
Edelist, the press of ‘the only democracy in the Middle East’ either 
didn’t dare comment, or was not allowed to. </p>
<p>The press is allowed, and even encouraged, to discuss one issue 
related to [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] policies: to say how clever Peres was in 
pretending to agree to negotiate [[nuclear]] disarmament and then 
raising unacceptable conditions for entering any such negotiations. </p>
<p>58 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>An example of this is Akiva Eldar’s coverage in [[Haaretz]] 
(19 [[February]]), of Rabin’s excoriation of [[Egypt]] on television a few 
days earlier. Rabin scolded [[Egypt]] for suggesting that a Middle East 
regional [[nuclear]] disarmament agreement would be desirable. Eldar 
comments that “The Prime Minister is known to loathe anything 
that relates to [[Egypt]]. Aiming at Boutros Ghali, he said [in a public 
speech]: “What can you expect of him? Isn’t he an [[Egypt]]ian?” Rabin 
is particularly averse to [[Egypt]]ian insistence that the Middle East 
should be completely de[[nuclear]]ized. Peres, by contrast, favours 
using [[Egypt]] as an intermediary in various diplomatic pursuits, 
while recognizing that Cairo’s reminders on the subject of Dimona 
obstruct his real mission, which is to mediate between [[Egypt]] and 
the grand man in Jerusalem.’ Therefore, after “[[Egypt]] recently 
invited [[Israel]] to a symposium that “would deal with both 
conventional and non-conventional armed confrontations”, a high- 
level discussion was held in the Foreign Ministry on how to pretend 
to accept the invitation and then “to decline it elegantly”. The 
solution was to communicate to [[Egypt]] the [[Israel]]i agreement in 
principle to attend the symposium on three conditions: that it be 
chaired by the US and [[Russia]]; that its agenda be unanimously 
determined by the chairmen and all the participants; and, most 
interestingly, that nothing be discussed unless the presence of all 
other Arab states, not just of Syria and [[Lebanon]], but also — hard 
to believe — of [[Libya]] and Iraq, be assured in advance. In this way, 
any conceivable discussion of [[nuclear]] affairs was effectively 
precluded.’ [ find it super[[flu]]ous to comment on Eldar’s story. </p>
<p>But I do want to make some comments on the incitement of 
[[Israel]]is against [[Iran]]. I am well aware that a lot of expert opinions 
and predictions quoted here will sound to non-[[Israel]]i readers like 
fantasy running amok. Yet I perceive those opinions and predictions, 
no matter how mendacious and deceitful they obviously are, as 
politically quite meaningful. Let me explain my reasons. In the first 
place, I have not quoted the opinions of raving extremists. I was 
careful to select only the writings of respected and in[[flu]]ential [[Israel]]i 
experts or commentators on strategic affairs, who can be presumed 
to be well acquainted with the thinking of the [[Israel]]i Security 
System. Since militarily [[Israel]] is the strongest state in the Middle 
East and has the monopoly on [[nuclear]] weapons in the region, 
strategical doctrines of its Security System deserve to be 
disseminated world-wide, especially when they are forcefully pressed 
upon the [[Israel]]i public. Whether one likes it or not, [[Israel]] is a great 
power, not only in military but also in political terms, by virtue of 
its increasing in[[flu]]ence upon US policies. The opinions of the 
[[Israel]]i Security System may mean something different from what 
they say. But this doesn’t detract from their importance. </p>
<p>ISRAEL VERSUS IRAN 59 </p>
<p>But there is more to it. Fantasy and madness in the doctrines of 
the [[Israel]]i Security System are nothing new. At least since the 
early [[1950]]s those qualities could already be noticed. Let us just 
recall that in [[1956]] Ben-Gurion wanted to annex Sinai to [[Israel]] on 
the ground that ‘it was not [[Egypt]]’. The same doctrine was professed 
in [[1967]]-73 with elaborations, such as the proposal of several 
generals to [[conquer]] Alexandria in order to hold the city hostage 
until [[Egypt]] would sign a peace [[treaty]] on [[Israel]]i terms. The [[1982]] 
invasion of [[Lebanon]] relied on fantastic assumptions, and so did 
the [[1983]] ‘peace [[treaty]]’ signed with a ‘lawful Lebanese [[government]]’ 
put in power by Sharon. All [[Israel]]i policies in the [[Territories]] are 
not just totally immoral, but also rely on assumptions steadily held 
and advocated without regard for their fanciful contents. It will 
suffice to recall how Rabin together with the entire [[Israel]]i Security 
System perceived the outbreak of the Intifada first as an [[Iran]]ian 
manipulation and then as a fabrication of western television and 
press. They concluded that if the Arabs are denied opportunities 
to fake riots in order to be photographed, the unrest in the [[Territories]] 
could be suppressed with ease. </p>
<p>Relevant to this is the fact that [[Israel]]i policies bear the easily 
recognizable imprint of Orientalist ‘expertise’ abounding in militarist 
and racist ideological prejudices. This ‘expertise’ is readily available 
in English, since its harbingers were the Jewish Orientalists living 
in English-speaking countries, like Bernard Lewis or the late Elie 
Kedourie who had visited [[Israel]] regularly for hobnobbing on the 
best of terms with the [[Israel]]i Security System. It was Kedourie who 
performed a particularly seminal role in fathering the assumptions 
on which [[Israel]]i policies rest and who consequently had in [[Israel]] 
a lot of in[[flu]]ence. In Kedourie’s view, the peoples of the Middle 
East, with the ‘self-evident’ exception of [[Israel]], would be best off 
if ruled by foreign imperial powers with a natural capacity to rule 
for a long time yet. Kedourie believed that the entire Middle East 
could be ruled by foreign powers with perfect ease, because their 
domination would hardly be opposed except by grouplets of 
intellectuals bent on rabble-rousing. Kedourie lived in [[Britain]], 
and his primary concern was [[British]] politics. In his opinion the 
Bnitish refused to continue to rule the Middle East, with calamitous 
effects, only because of intellectual corruption of their own experts, 
especially those from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office at 
Chatham House, who were misguided enough to dismiss the 
superior expertise of minority nationals, particularly Jewish, from 
the Arab world, who alone had known ‘the Arab nature’ at first 
hand. For example, in his first book, Kedourie says that as early 
as [[1932]] (!) the [[British]] [[government]] was misguided enough to grant 
Iraq independence (it was faked, but never mind) against the 
advice of Jewish community in Baghdad. On many occasions </p>
<p>60 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>during his recurrent visits to [[Israel]], from the [[1960]]s until his [[death]], 
Kedourie would assure his [[Israel]]i audiences (one of which I was a 
member) that Iraq could ‘really’ be still ruled by the [[British]] with 
ease, under whatever disguises it would be convenient to adopt, 
provided the grouplets of rabble-rousers would be dealt with by a 
modicum of salutary toughness. That, the opportunities for 
education would be restricted so as not to produce a super[[flu]]ous 
number of intellectuals, prone to learn the western notions of 
national independence. True, Kedourie also opposed the idea of 
exclusive Jewish right to the Land of [[Israel]] as incompatible with 
his imperialistic outlook, but he favoured the retention of [[Israel]]i 
permanent rule over the Palestinians. The rather incongruous 
blend of Kedourie’s ideas with the Land of [[Israel]] messianism is 
already an innovation of [[Israel]]i Security System vintage. </p>
<p>The implications of the Kedourie doctrine for [[Israel]]i policy- 
makers are obvious. First, [[Israel]] always seeks to persuade the West 
about what its ‘true’ interests and ‘moral duties’ in the Middle East 
are. It also tells the West that by intervening in the Middle East 
they would serve the authentic interests of Middle [[Eastern]] nations. 
But if the western powers refuse to listen, it is up to [[Israel]] to 
assume ‘the [[white]] man’s burden’. </p>
<p>Another implication of Kedourie’s doctrine, acted upon by [[Israel]] 
since the early [[1950]]s already, is that in the Middle East no other 
strong state is to be tolerated. Its power must be destroyed or at 
least diminished through a war. [[Iran]]ian theocracy may have its utility 
for the [[Israel]]i Hasbara, but Nasser’s [[Egypt]] was attacked while 
being emphatically secular. In both cases the real reason for the 
[[Israel]]i threat to start a war was the strength of the state concerned. 
Quite apart from the risks such a state may pose to [[Israel]]i hegemonic 
ambitions, Orientalist ‘expertise’ requires that natives of the region 
always remain weak, to be ruled always by their traditional notables 
but not by persons with intellectual capacity, whether religious or 
secular. Before World [[War]] I, such principles were taken for granted 
in the West, professed openly and applied globally, from [[China]] to 
[[Mexico]]. [[Israel]]i Orientalism, on which [[Israel]]i policies are based, is 
no more than their belated replica. It continues to uphold dogmas 
which, say in [[1903]], were taken for granted as ‘scientific’ truths. The 
subsequent ‘troubles’ of the West are perceived by the [[Israel]]i 
‘experts’ as a well-deserved punishment for listening to intellectuals 
who had been casting doubt on such self-evident truths. Without 
such rotten intellectuals, everything would have remained stable. </p>
<p>Let us return to the special case of [[Iran]], though. Anyone not 
converted to the Orientalistic creed will recognize that [[Iran]] is a 
country very difficult to [[conquer]], because of its size, topography 
and especially because of fervent nationalism combined with the 
religious zeal of its populace. I happen to loathe the current [[Iran]]ian </p>
<p>ISRAEL VERSUS IRAN 61 </p>
<p>regime, but it doesn’t hinder me from immediately noticing how 
different it is from Saddam Hussein’s. Popular support for [[Iran]]’s 
rulers is much greater than for Iraq’s. After Saddam Hussein had 
invaded [[Iran]], his troops were resisted valiantly under extremely 
difficult conditions. All analogies between a possible attack on 
[[Iran]] and the Gulf [[War]] are therefore irresponsibly fanciful. Yet 
Sharon and the [[Israel]]i Army commanders did in [[1979]] propose to 
send a detachment of [[Israel]]i paratroopers to Tehran to quash the 
[[revolution]] and restore the monarchy. They really thought, until 
stopped by Begin, that a few [[Israel]]i paratroopers could determine 
the [[history]] of a country as immense and populous as [[Iran]]! According 
to a consensus of official [[Israel]]i experts on [[Iran]]ian affairs, the fall 
of the Shah was due solely to his ‘softness’ in refraining to order 
his army to slaughter thousands of demonstrators wholesale. Later, 
the [[Israel]]i experts on [[Iran]]ian affairs were no less unanimous in 
predicting a speedy defeat of [[Iran]] by Saddam Hussein. No evidence 
indicates that they have changed their assumptions or discarded 
their underlying [[racism]]. Their ranks may include some relatively 
less-opinionated individuals, who have survived the negative 
selection process which usually occurs within groups sharing such 
ideologically-tight imageries. But such individuals can be assumed 
to prefer to keep their moderation to themselves, while hoping that 
[[Israel]] can reap some fringe benefits from any western provocation 
against [[Iran]], even if it results in a protracted and inconclusive war. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i Foreign Policy after the Oslo 
Accord 
1 [[November]] [[1993]] </p>
<p>The right word to describe the thirty-year-old dependence of [[Israel]]i 
policies on the US was coined by Davar’s political commentator 
Daniel Ben-Simon, who speaks of the ‘former [[America]]n tutelage’ 
of [[Israel]] (18 [[October]] [[1993]]). Ben-Simon’s view is correct when he 
says that ‘until quite recently [[Israel]]i foreign policy was carried out 
according to the rules imposed by the State Department and the 
White House. Nothing was done in defiance of those rules. All 
former peace initiatives in the Middle East were launched by the 
[[America]]ns.’ Yet Ben-Simon also says that ‘the Oslo Accord put 
[[Israel]]’s patron to shame. While chiefs of the State Department were 
busily overseeing the progress of [[Israel]]i—Palestinian negotiations 
in [[Washington]], Rabin and Peres closed the deal in distant Oslo. 
The US was notified of the Accord barely a few days before its 
finalization, as a gesture to spare them an overt insult, and in order 
to make it still possible for them to disburse money needed for its 
implementation.’ </p>
<p>His conclusion, with which I again concur, is that ‘the main loser 
from this rapid increase in the [[Israel]]i power of diplomatic manoeuvre 
is the US. The Accord with the PLO which generated sympathy 
for [[Israel]] has also made it more confident of its power than it ever 
was.’ Commenting on this new self-confidence, Ben-Simon 
elaborates that ‘some factions of major importance within [[Israel]]i 
establishment are quite satisfied with this weakening of the [[America]]n 
tutelage’, but ‘Rabin does not belong to them. Regardless of gains 
in the independence of [[Israel]]i policies, he still feels that the [[America]]n 
protective umbrella over [[Israel]] is the best guarantee of its security.’ 
Right now, however, [[Israel]]i foreign policy is noticeably different 
from what it was before, increasingly aiming at getting rid of 
‘[[America]]n tutelage’. This change, placed in a broader historical 
context, will be described here. </p>
<p>The politically prodigious and financially unprecedented support 
which [[Israel]] was receiving from the US since the early [[1960]]s until 
this year has actually never determined [[Israel]]i policies entirely. To 
begin with, it superseded the period of frequent conflicts between </p>
<p>62 </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE OSLO ACCORD 63 </p>
<p>the US and [[Israel]] in the [[1950]]s. These conflicts flared up during 
the Suez affair of [[1956]] when Eisenhower forced [[Israel]] to withdraw 
unconditionally not only from Sinai but also from the Gaza Strip. 
Since the early [[1960]]s, however, [[Israel]] has wielded tremendous 
in[[flu]]ence within the US, and it was capable of turning that in[[flu]]ence 
to its advantage. Owing to this, ‘[[America]]n tutelage’ has never 
worked perfectly, as [[Israel]] did occasionally pursue policies not in 
accord with US interests. Even more than that: by exploiting its 
in[[flu]]ence on the [[Congress]] and the US media, [[Israel]] could 
occasionally force the US administration to reverse its policies 
completely. When the Carter administration announced its accord 
with the USSR as its policy programme for the Middle East, which 
was not to the taste of the Begin [[government]], the latter dispatched 
its then Foreign Minister, Dayan to the US. Within three days, 
Dayan succeeded in making the Carter administration 
ignominiously reverse itself. Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem, the Camp 
David negotiations, the [[Israel]]i-[[Egypt]]ian peace and the [[1982]] 
invasion of [[Lebanon]] can all be seen as contingent upon Dayan’s 
humiliation of Carter in this affair. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]’s economic situation and its standing within the 
international community can also be reasonably supposed to affect 
the degree of [[Israel]]i dependence on the US. Whenever [[Israel]] is in 
financial straits (whether for economic or other reasons) and 
whenever its relations with other great powers are strained, its 
dependence on the US cannot but be on the rise. But whenever 
the [[Israel]]i [[government]] and the [[Israel]]i wealthy elite are financially 
well-off (even if the [[Israel]]i poor then get poorer) [[Israel]]’s dependence 
on the US can be reduced, and [[Israel]] can then assume a more 
independent policy posture. </p>
<p>For example, the invasion of [[Lebanon]] resulted in an [[Israel]]i 
conquest of a relatively large territory and in [[Israel]]’s deep 
involvement in Lebanese domestic affairs. The invasion was made 
possible by a long period of steady and enormous increases in the 
size of the [[Israel]]i Defence budgets, beginning in [[1967]] and 
continuing until [[1984]]. But the occupation of [[Lebanon]] resulted in 
a bloody guerilla war in which [[Israel]] was defeated not only militarily 
but also economically. Nehemya Strassler, writing in [[Haaretz]], 
(6 [[August]]) gave the following vivid picture of the resultant economic 
situation: “By the beginning of [[1985]] the [[Israel]]i economy was on 
the verge of collapse, which could lead to a collapse of [[Israel]]i 
democracy. The only way to avert it was by stopping the 
hyperinflation. The monthly inflation rate stood then at 15 per cent. 
The economy was in a shambles, the dollar reserves were already 
almost spent. The situation was grievous enough to make the 
Treasury contemplate the imposition of quotas on all imports to 
stave off the vanishing of all hard currency.’ Being in such a </p>
<p>64 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>shambles, [[Israel]] was shunned by all major Third World states. Given 
such realities, [[Israel]]’s dependence on the US couldn’t but stand 
at its highest. </p>
<p>In my view, this state of affairs continued until [[1992]], all the shows 
of the Shamir [[government]]’s defiance of the US notwithstanding. 
The Madrid Conference was convened through [[America]]n efforts 
and was run openly by the US. In contrast to that, the signing of 
the Accord on principles on the White House lawn belonged in a 
show-business category, constituting a facade behind which true 
machinations were done by [[Israel]] without US knowledge or 
involvement. In contrast to [[1985]], the [[Israel]]i [[government]] now has 
plenty of money, due to US military aid of unprecedented 
magnitude granted by the [[Bush]] administration during and after the 
Gulf [[War]], and to guarantees granted by the [[Clinton]] administration 
which are hardly used for their avowed purpose of helping absorb 
the Jewish immigrants from the former USSR. The fact of their 
being used for other purposes can best be seen from long lines of 
those immigrants before the [[Russia]]n Embassy in Tel Aviv looking 
forward to their return to [[Russia]]. </p>
<p>This is why the present situation is very different. Ben-Simon 
quotes the [[[Israel]]i] Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, as saying that 
‘[[Israel]]i diplomacy extends all over the world. [[Israel]]i [[representative]]s 
are now welcomed in almost every capital and regarded by the 
international community as its equal members ... Rabin’s recent 
journey to [[Indonesia]] can be seen as the culmination of this process 
of breaking the anti-[[Israel]]i taboos. After all, [[Indonesia]] 1s the largest 
Muslim state in the world, and yet Rabin’s visit there was public. 
After the duly publicized deep [[Israel]]i penetration into [[China]] and 
India, [[Indonesia]] symbolizes the most radical change in [[Israel]]’s 
international status.’ </p>
<p>[[Israel]] also expects to profit from [[trade]] with countries such as 
[[China]], even if such [[trade]] links displease the US. Of course, [[Israel]] 
is vitally interested in maintaining its in[[flu]]ence upon the [[Clinton]] 
administration so as to prevent any reduction in the present levels 
of [[America]]n aid and any serious US [[protest]] against its independent 
policy ventures. [[Israel]]i independence can work as long as [[Clinton]] 
remains ready to finance (or press other countries to finance) that 
‘independence’. Unless [[Israel]] soon acquires its own sources of 
income, its emancipation from [[America]]n tutelage will remain 
contingent on the weakness and crassness of [[Clinton]]’s foreign 
policies and on the recent remarkable gains in in[[flu]]ence of organized 
US Jews upon his administration. The situation in this respect was 
well sumarized by [[Haaretz]] correspondent Orri Nir who reported 
(6 [[July]]) that ‘[[Clinton]] feels committed to the Jewish vote and even 
more to Jewish campaign donations’, and that his administration 
‘has a firm “Jewish connection”’, </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE OSLO ACCORD 65 </p>
<p>Whatever financial benefits [[Israel]] expects to derive from its 
foreign policy ventures, their chief aim undoubtedly remains the 
neutralization of the power of [[Iran]]. To all appearances, [[Israel]] 
would like to overthrow the present [[Iran]]ian regime and replace it 
with another one, upon which [[Israel]] could maintain an in[[flu]]ence 
comparable to that it had upon the regime of the late Shah. It ts 
again Ben-Simon who described it aptly: “There is a latent factor 
behind Rabin’s visits to two major countries on his route, that 1s, 
[[China]] and [[Indonesia]]. It is the [[Israel]]i fear of [[Iran]]. Once the [[Israel]]i 
top establishment came to the conclusion that [[Iran]] is the most 
dangerous enemy not just of [[Israel]] but of the entire Middle East, 
it has spared no efforts to disseminate this conviction abroad. 
Before departing to [[China]] the Prime Minister said that the real 
purpose of his visit was to explain to his hosts how terrible was the 
danger posed by [[Iran]] to the entire Middle East. “I intend to clarify 
to them how dangerous Islamic funda[[mental]]ism is, not just to [[Israel]] 
and all its neighbours, but also to the world at large”, said Rabin 
in his interview with Davar, only one day before he embarked 
for [[China]]. </p>
<p>‘[[China]] is one of the main suppliers of weaponry to [[Iran]], so the 
Prime Minister had a good reason to concentrate on this topic during 
his recent tour. For the same reason [[Israel]] has opened the channels 
for the talks with [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]], without bothering about the angry 
response of the US administration to them. The purpose was to 
do everything possible to halt the non-conventional [that is, [[nuclear]]] 
arming of [[Iran]]. For this purpose, [[Israel]] is now willing to talk to 
any state, so as to leave [[Iran]] to its own devices, or at least to 
decrease its receiving any non-conventional armament supplies from 
anywhere in the world.’ It can be taken for granted that in regard 
to [[Iran]], [[Israel]] wants more than ‘leaving it to its own devices’. 
Nevertheless, it is perfectly credible that stirring up any conceivable 
country against [[Iran]] remains the guiding principle of the new and 
independent [[Israel]]i policies. </p>
<p>The case of [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]] may not be the most important, but it 
is typical. It was described by Nahum Barnea in Yediot Ahronot on 
20 [[August]], that is before the signing of the Accord with the PLO. 
Barnea informs us that in its ‘talks with [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]] conducted 
by the Deputy Director of the Foreign Ministry, Eitan Bentzur, 
[[Israel]] asked for stopping the sales of the [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]n Scuds to 
[[Iran]] and Syria. Like so many backward regimes, the [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]ns 
firmly stick to the myth of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. From 
this myth they draw a conclusion that via [[Israel]] they can easily win 
some access to [[America]], and that this access may perhaps rescue 
their regime in an hour of dire emergency.’ Complicated as the deal 
was, it was almost finalized. There was a third party to it, namely 
‘a [[Canadian]] bank, friendly to [[Israel]], very interested in the project. </p>
<p>66 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>The bank proposed to consider an investment of $500 million on 
the sole condition that the [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]ns sever all relations with 
[[Iran]].’ The expression ‘friendly to [[Israel]]’ may be safely presumed 
to mean that it was controlled by Mossad. The readers of the 
Hebrew press realize that at least since the [[1960]]s [[Israel]]i foreign 
affairs are quite often run with the help of financial institutions or 
individual wealthy businessmen, usually but not necessarily Jewish, 
who act on orders from Mossad as a quid pro quo for the state of 
[[Israel]]’s support for their private business deals. This was the pattern 
to be observed in the [[Iran]]gate affair. </p>
<p>But let me return to the story of the deal with [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]. The 
secret negotiations were first discovered by the [[Japanese]], who 
‘became enraged and made a scandal’ but had no power to stop 
them: ‘It had already been arranged that Bentzur was soon to meet 
the daughter of the almighty [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]n leader Kim I]-Sung 
and close the deal. The daughter is third in the [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]n 
hierarchy, right after the son.’ At the same time ‘the [[America]]ns 
claimed that they had opened negotiations with [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]] on 
the [[nuclear]] issue. Consequently, they were upset over [[Israel]]’s 
messing up. The Deputy of the National Defence Council Sandy 
Berger and the Deputy State Secretary Peter Tarnoff put pressure 
on Christopher to drive [[Israel]] away from [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]. They 
argued that they themselves could press [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]] to sever its 
relations with [[Iran]].’ Probably because this happened right before 
the finalization and publication of the Oslo Accord, the [[Israel]]i 
[[government]] reluctantly agreed to cancel the deal with [[North]] 
[[[[Korea]]]]. Barnea draws two conclusions from that affair. The first is 
that ‘unfortunately, [[Israel]] does not believe that for the US [[Iran]] is 
as important as it is for [[Israel]].’ It can be construed as meaning that 
if [[Israel]]’s primary aim is to neutralize the [[Iran]]ian power, [[Israel]] needs 
to get rid of the [[America]]n tutelage, at least to some extent. Barnea’s 
second conclusion is that ‘the great [[[Israel]]i] fear that other states 
may yet realize that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are after 
all a myth — that the Jews do not rule over the US, but the US 
rules over the Jews - cannot be so easily dissipated. For if this 
calamity indeed occurs, it is going to be unbearable for us.’ Indeed, 
the [[Israel]]i power has two components: one real, based on its own 
strength and its real in[[flu]]ence within the US, and the other 
imaginary, based on its cultivation of anti-Semitic myths in various 
countries. Especially under [[Clinton]], these two components are 
craftily blended. </p>
<p>‘The most important state whose interests [[Israel]] is now advancing 
against (at least avowed) US interests is Iraq. After many previous 
hints to this effect in Hebrew press, the well-informed veteran 
journalist Moshe Zak brought the affair into the open in an article 
entitled ‘Are we ready to make peace with Iraq?’ (Maariv, </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE OSLO ACCORD 67 </p>
<p>28 [[October]]). He thinks [[Israel]] is indeed trying to establish friendly 
relations with Saddam Hussein’s regime, his evidence being the 
words of [[Israel]]i Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, uttered in the 
course of an interview with the leading [[Egypt]]ian newspaper 
Al Ahram. Peres said there that ‘[[Israel]] is ready to make peace with 
any Middle [[Eastern]] state with the exception of [[Iran]].’ Zak comments, 
‘Can this be true? Are we ready to make peace with Saddam 
Hussein, in defiance of sanctions imposed on him by all the states 
of the world? Will [[Israel]] be involved in an Iraqgate, responding to 
Iraq’s frantic search for a hole in the wall erected by the Free 
World around Saddam Hussein?’ Zak speaks of ‘an old [[Israel]]i 
delusion’ contributing to its siding with Iraq during the [[Iran]]-Iraq 
[[War]]. His crucial argument, however, is that any evidence of good 
[[Israel]]i relations with Irag will undermine current [[Israel]]i efforts to 
convince states like [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]], [[China]] or ‘some [[Europe]]an states’ 
to stop arming [[Iran]]. He nevertheless concludes his article by 
formulating an argument in favour of what in my view can only be 
interpreted as the existence of an [[Israel]]i [[alliance]] with Iraq: ‘Some 
Arab oil states have already suggested through go-betweens that 
they may sell oil to [[Israel]] even prior to the signing of the Accord 
with the PLO. After discarding their erstwhile delusions that they 
will ever be able to prevent oil from reaching [[Israel]], they are already 
prepared to sell their oil to any purchaser. Therefore, Iraq’s possible 
offer to sell oil to [[Israel]] should not be regarded as worth risking a 
political confrontation with the US. Iraq is not doing us any favour 
by such an offer, whereas for [[Israel]] the main thing is to keep 
international solidarity with states fighting terrorism.’ </p>
<p>Let me comment here that Zak differs from Peres about [[Israel]]i 
relations with Iraq only on purely pragmatic grounds. For Zak, ‘a 
risk of a political confrontation with the US’ or the persuasive power 
of [[Israel]]i arguments vis-a-vis gangster states like [[China]] and [[North]] 
[[[[Korea]]]] outweigh what in his view are problematic benefits, derivable 
from purchasing or reselling Iraqi oil. But Peres may know better 
that under the [[Clinton]] administration the US is not going to enter 
‘a political confrontation’ with [[Israel]] no matter what the latter 
may do, or that an appeal to [[China]] or [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]] on grounds of 
‘international solidarity’ is bound to be useless. Since Zak has 
never joined any anti-[[Iran]]ian propaganda campaign and since he 
writes under censorship constraints, my impression is that he is 
genuine in warning the [[Israel]]is against an [[alliance]] with Iraq, but 
cannot fully disclose his real arguments against it. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i relations with Kenya and Eritrea seem to belong to the 
same category as its relations with Iraq. Hami Shalev and Yerah 
Tal report in [[Haaretz]] on 18 [[October]], that the main aim of Rabin’s 
visit to Kenya was ‘to coordinate ways to prevent the intrusion of 
funda[[mental]]ist Islamic forces into the Horn of [[Africa]]. Highly </p>
<p>68 OPEN. SECRETS </p>
<p>placed [[Israel]]i sources intimate that during his meeting with [[President]] 
Arap Moi of Kenya, Rabin told Moi that Sudan is increasingly 
engaged in subversive activities against Kenya. The two agreed to 
coordinate measures against their common enemy, especially in the 
realm of intelligence.’ Shalev and Tal also say that ‘[[Israel]] is 
conveying similar warnings to Eritrean authorities’ with which 
[[Israel]] maintains good relations. And they add that Kenya was 
requested by [[Israel]] to convey the same kind of warnings to Tanzania 
and Uganda: two countries with which [[Israel]] does not have 
good contacts. </p>
<p>As is well known, economic exchanges between [[Israel]] and [[China]] 
have been flourishing. But [[Israel]]i relations with [[China]] have also 
their strategic and intelligence aspects to which the Hebrew press 
has paid a deal of attention. ‘Those aspects were best summed up 
by Moshe Zak in Ha’olam Ha’ze (20 [[October]]). Zak views ‘the 
mystery of [[Israel]]’s power over the [[Chinese]] leadership’ in the same 
terms as Barnea interprets the [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]]ns: “The leaders of [[China]] 
firmly believe that the US and [[Israel]] coordinate their policies and 
that [[Israel]] has a great in[[flu]]ence in [[Washington]]. This is why the 
[[Chinese]] Prime Minister, Li Peng, asked Rabin during their 
conversation to act as a go-between to soothe the tension between 
[[Beijing]] and [[Washington]] which appeared after the [[Chinese]] 
underground [[nuclear]] test. Through Rabin, the [[Chinese]] Prime 
Minister conveyed a message to the US, offering to open 
negotiations to discuss this issue.’ Zak observes that although many 
presidents and prime ministers visited [[Beijing]] between the time of 
the [[nuclear]] test and Rabin’s visit, ‘none of them was entrusted with 
such a message.’ He also says that ‘when the entire [[Chinese]] 
leadership spoke with Rabin about the scope of [[Chinese]] relations 
with [[Israel]], they did not neglect to emphasize frequently that those 
relations are with the Jewish people anywhere, whose power and 
in[[flu]]ence surpasses beyond any comparison that of the four-and- 
a-half million Jews residing in [[Israel]].’ </p>
<p>Zak says that ‘in spite of the regrettably hostile publications in 
the [[America]]n media about the nature of [[Israel]]i relations with 
[[China]], the US administration is not objecting to [[Chinese]]—[[Israel]]i 
contacts as such.’ Zak may be presumed to have had primarily in 
his mind a [[New]] York Times [[editorial]], summarized in [[Haaretz]] on 
17 [[October]], which objected to [[Israel]]’s sales to [[China]] of weapons 
and sophisticated technology which may be of an [[America]]n 
provenance. In fact, the US administration may be safely assumed 
to be satisfied with such sales, which can hardly be effected by itself 
due to the opposition of the human rights lobby. Unlike in the US, 
in [[Israel]] there is no such lobby of any importance, who would have 
objected to arms sales to [[China]] (or any other state) on the ground 
of the latter’s record of oppression and denial of human rights. After </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY AFTER THE OSLO ACCORD 69 </p>
<p>all, the massacre of the demonstrators in [[Beijing]]’s Square of 
Heavenly Peace was perpetrated by tanks equipped with [[Israel]]i 
cannon and spare parts. According to Zak, the [[Chinese]] [[government]] 
‘is clever enough’ to understand that ‘the hostile publications in 
the [[America]]n media about [[Israel]]i weaponry sales to [[China]] do not 
reflect in the least any tension between [[Israel]] and the US over this 
matter.’ On the other hand, ‘[[China]] has promised, and has kept its 
promise, not to use sophisticated technology purchased from [[Israel]] 
when exporting its own arms to countries hostile to [[Israel]].’ </p>
<p>Zak recounts in detail the long story of [[Chinese]] relations with 
the PLO, including their personal relations with Arafat, who visited 
[[Beijing]] as early as [[1964]], even before the PLO’s foundation. I 
concur with Zak’s opinion that the [[Chinese]] did genuinely 
sympathize with the PLO in the [[1960]]s and [[1970]]s, though they were 
piqued by the latter’s systematic rejection of their advice on how 
to fight a guerilla war. But the quality of [[Chinese]] relations with the 
PLO changed drastically ‘some time before [[1988]], the year in which 
tanks with [[Israel]]i-manufactured cannon appeared at a [[Beijing]] 
military parade, prompting the international press to publish stories 
about huge arms deals between [[Israel]] and [[China]].’ From that point 
in time, the good relations which [[China]] had maintained with the 
PLO began to be used by the [[Chinese]] primarily as a convenient 
camouflage of their ties with [[Israel]]. I detect the same pattern of 
camouflage practised by other countries, some of them Arab, like 
Morocco or [[Oman]]. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i contacts with [[Indonesia]] follow the same pattern as with 
[[China]], except that they have been less important and could be easier 
kept under wraps which would suit the fact that [[Indonesia]] is 
predominantly a Muslim country. Motti Bassuk, writing in Davar 
(17 [[October]]), says that ‘in recent years the US imposed [[trade]] and 
other restrictions on [[Indonesia]] in response to flagrant violations 
of funda[[mental]] human rights by [[Indonesia]]n authorities. For 
[[Indonesia]] this was a reason to improve its relations with [[Israel]]. In 
Jakarta, as in so many other Third World capitals, one can encounter 
a staunch belief that [[Israel]]’s in[[flu]]ence on the US borders on the 
magic. By the way, in so far as human rights or rather their absence 
are concerned, [[Indonesia]] is hardly any different from Morocco.’ 
(The last sentence is a typical ploy the Hebrew press uses to 
circumvent censorship. Mossad had excellent relations with the 
latter country since [[1960]]s.) Let me omit Bassuk’s long story of 
[[Indonesia]]’s earlier hostility to [[Israel]] and begin with the reversal of 
that attitude, which has been commonly dated to when stories of 
[[Indonesia]]n atrocities began to appear in the international media 
after the invasion of East Timor. Bassuk says that ‘in the late 
[[1970]]s, close relations were established between Mossad and its 
counterpart in [[Indonesia]]. According to foreign sources, in [[1979]] </p>
<p>70 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[Israel]] sold 28 Skyhawk fighter planes and 11 war helicopters from 
its Air Force surplus to [[Indonesia]].’ Let me comment that ‘[[Israel]]i 
Air Force surplus’ derives from [[America]]n supplies and that [[Israel]] 
cannot sell anything from it without [[America]]n approval. According 
to Hami Shalev ([[Haaretz]], 17 [[October]]), the [[Indonesia]]n [[President]], 
Suharto, ‘once tried to keep good relations with [[Iran]] in order to 
control the impact of [[Iran]]ian funda[[mental]]ism upon his country’s 
domestic affairs’. Eventually, however, he was persuaded (Shalev 
does not say by whom) ‘that 1t would more advisable to establish 
open relations with [[Israel]] in order to coordinate with it the measures 
designed to contain the funda[[mental]]ist threat’. The whole story 
of [[Indonesia]] trumpeting its support for the PLO on every official 
occasion, especially in the UN, and its simultaneous cooperation 
with Mossad replicates the [[Chinese]] pattern so closely that there is 
no need to recount it separately. </p>
<p>Let me conclude by providing a list of countries with which [[Israel]] 
now has important Intelligence and/or other unsavoury contacts. 
The list has been compiled solely on the basis of overt or covert 
information to be found in the Hebrew press and may be 
incomplete: </p>
<p>¢ Asia: [[Turkey]], [[China]], [[Taiwan]], Thailand, Singapore, [[Indonesia]], 
Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, [[Oman]]. Relations with India have 
been sporadic and transient and with Sri Lanka have been 
severed. </p>
<p>¢ [[Africa]]: [[Egypt]], Eritrea, Kenya, Malawi, Zaire, Nigeria, Ivory 
Coast, Morocco. Relations with [[South]] [[Africa]], formerly so 
close, recently became rather cool and loose. </p>
<p>¢ Latin [[America]]: Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Colombia, 
Ecuador, Paraguay, Chile. Some intelligence contacts are 
also pursued with [[Mexico]], but it is difficult to know what is 
their exact scope. </p>
<p>Coalition Building Against [[Iran]] 
21 [[February]] [[1994]] </p>
<p>[[Israel]]’s Middle [[Eastern]] policies, centered on its enmity to [[Iran]] need 
to be discussed in a global context. For example, [[Israel]]i relations 
with a country located as far away from [[Iran]] as Estonia have a 
lot to do with the [[Israel]]i hostility toward [[Iran]]. On 5 [[January]] 
[[1994]], Maariv published an article by Shlomo Avineri, Professor 
of Sociology at the Hebrew University who, as the newspaper noted 
‘is a former Director General of the Foreign Ministry’, and whose 
involvements in shaping [[Israel]]i foreign policies are certainly not 
yet terminated. In Avineri’s view, the recent [[Israel]]i arms sales to 
Estonia, ‘were not an initiative of those in charge of [[Israel]]i foreign 
and security affairs. Ihe main reason the [[Israel]]i [[government]] 
approved this transaction was the intention to extricate [[Israel]]i 
military industries (or some individuals within them) from their 
present crisis. This was enough to grant [[Israel]]i credits to Estonia, 
which had no substantial foreign currency reserves at its disposal.’ 
Avineri’s argument against that deal was that it ‘might impair [[Israel]]i 
relations with [[Russia]]’. In his view [[Russia]] and [[Israel]] have “important 
strategical interests in common, such as the struggle against 
Islamic funda[[mental]]ism’. The Estonian deal ‘gave rise to very hard 
feelings in Moscow, thus under[[mining]] the potential for developing 
those all-important relations’. Although information on such 
subjects is hardly ever published, [[Israel]] does seem to help advance 
[[Russia]]n interests in various Muslim states of the former USSR. 
But this is just a case in point, illustrating a broader phenomenon. 
Before discussing [[Israel]]i policies toward several Middle [[Eastern]] 
states, let me yet say something about their general background 
which normally escapes the attention of observers who merely 
monitor the UN Resolutions or diplomacy in general. Since [[1991]], 
[[Israel]]i relations with most Middle [[Eastern]] regimes have ranged from 
good to excellent. For instance, Gabby Bron writes in Yedtzot 
Ahronot (25 [[January]]), that ‘[[Israel]] buys 90 per cent of its oil from 
Arab countries’ (the remaining 10 per cent comes from Norway), 
and feels secure enough about these supplies to cancel its oil 
purchase contracts with [[Mexico]]. Of the 90 per cent oil bought in </p>
<p>71 </p>
<p>ve OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>the Middle East, 40 per cent comes from [[Egypt]], and no less than 
50 per cent ‘from Arab states of the Gulf’. </p>
<p>On 8 [[February]], Hayim Handwoker noted in F...uretz that Benny 
Ga’on, the Director General of Koor, one of the largest [[Israel]]i 
corporations, told the Wall Street fournal that ‘the [[trade]] between 
[[Israel]] and the Arab states amounts to $500 million annually.’ As 
[[Haaretz]] admits, with the exception of [[Egypt]] the Arab states 
concerned are those which are still formally boycotting [[Israel]]. On 
the basis of well-informed sources, I can only see the quoted tigure 
as a gross underestimate, because in [[1993]] this [[trade]] amounted 
already to about $1.4 billion. Also on 8 [[February]], Zohar 
Blumencrantz informed [[Haaretz]] that ‘the [[Israel]]i Export Institute 
has very close relations with its partners in [[Lebanon]], [[Algeria]] and 
Tunisia’ and that [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with such traditional Arab outlets 
for [[Israel]]i exports as Morocco had recently increased. [[Israel]]is with 
double citizenship who recently visited Syria on their foreign 
passports report that a lot of clothes and textiles on sale in Syrian 
shops or bazaars were recognizable as [[Israel]]i-made. Moreover, the 
fictitious tags to be seen until few years ago, for example, ‘Made 
in the Occupied [[Territories]]’ or ‘Made in Gibraltar’ now have 
disappeared from sight. Syrian customers appeared well aware 
where the clothes had come from. Palestinians who returned from 
Iraq report similar sightings in the shops of Baghdad, although 
without being able to say whether the Iraqi customers, too scared 
to talk freely, were as aware of the origin of the merchandise as the 
Syrian ones. </p>
<p>Another example of close [[Israel]]i relations with an Arab Gulf 
regime was provided by Amir Oren (Davar, 7 [[January]]). 
Undoubtedly echoing views of some high-ranking officers in the 
Security System, Oren opines that in addition to using its Air 
Force as an anti-[[Iran]]ian [[nuclear]] deterrent, [[Israel]] should ‘plunge 
its strategic [that is, [[nuclear]]] deterrence power into the depths of 
the sea, where it can be best protected and from where it can 
threaten potential attackers. Since deterrence rests on the image 
of power, [[Israel]] needs to stress the existence of its submarine 
weapons.’ Oren finds cooperation with the US for this purpose 
essential, because only the US can sell suitable submarines cheaply 
to [[Israel]]. Oren also has an opinion about where [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] 
submarines should be stationed in order to have a maximum 
deterrent power against [[Iran]]: [[Oman]], with which [[Israel]] should fast 
form an [[alliance]]. As seen on a map, [[Oman]] is close to what Oren 
terms ‘[[Iran]]’s hinterland’. Although the US consent to this scheme 
is problematic, the plan is by no means absurd. Covert [[Israel]]i 
relations with [[Oman]] go back at least to [[1968]], when [[Israel]] started 
drilling for oil in what it then regarded as ‘its’ part of the Gulf of 
Suez. The drilling platform on the sea surface used for the purpose </p>
<p>COALITION BUILDING AGAINST IRAN a3 </p>
<p>was imported from [[Oman]]. It was escorted half-way by the Shah’s 
Navy, and the other half by the [[Israel]]i one. After the Shah’s 
downfall the [[Israel]]i relations with [[Oman]] to all appearances improved 
even further. </p>
<p>Recently, much publicity has been given to the [[Israel]]i enticement 
of [[Turkey]] as a prospective ally against [[Iran]]. This has obvious 
implications for [[Israel]]i attitudes toward the Kurds and [[Israel]]i 
relations with [[Turkey]]’s neighbours, Syria and Iraq. A considerable 
amount of space was devoted by the Hebrew press to the Turkish 
visit of the [[President]] Ezer Weizman of [[Israel]], who was accompanied 
there by a number of businessmen. I am going to rely primarily on 
two articles by Aluf Ben ([[Haaretz]], 11 and 31 [[January]]) and one by 
Yoav Karni (Shishi, 4 [[February]]) which emphasizes the Kurdish 
issue; but I will draw some information from other articles as well. 
Both Ben and Karni recall that the close relations of [[Israel]] with 
[[Turkey]] go as far back as [[1958]], when Ben-Gurion formed ‘the 
periphery [[alliance]]’ with [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] was still ruled by the Shah, 
and Ethiopia was still ruled by Haile Selassie. According to Karni, 
one purpose of that [[alliance]] was ‘to throttle the very notion of Arab 
nationalism’. Eventually, the [[alliance]] collapsed as a result of the 
[[revolution]]s in Ethiopia and [[Iran]]. But as Karni writes, the relations 
between [[Israel]]i and Turkish armies and intelligence services have 
remained fairly close since, in spite of diplomatic ups and downs. </p>
<p>As Ben informs us on 11 [[January]], the relations between the [[Israel]]i 
and ‘Turkish armies and intelligence services have recently become 
even closer after ‘the [[1993]] visit of the Commander of the [[[Israel]]i] 
Air Force, General Herzl Budinger, to [[Turkey]]’ and of several 
Turkish ministers, including the Prime Minister, to Jerusalem. 
But apart from marginal matters, like some [[Israel]]i weaponry sales 
to [[Turkey]] and some enlargement of the volume of mutual [[trade]], 
the visits were not crowned by agreement on basic issues, despite 
[[America]]n encouragement. Ben reports that ‘the [[America]]ns are 
encouraging their allies in the Middle East to cooperate, and 
officials in the State Department stress to their [[Israel]]i opposite 
numbers the central place of [[Turkey]] in US strategic plans, whether 
in the Middle East, in the Balkan peninsula or toward the states 
of the former USSR. The [[America]]n officials recommended to 
[[Israel]] to look upon [[Turkey]] through [[America]]n spectacles.’ No 
doubt as a result of an encouragement by the US, even prior to 
Weizman’s visit [[Turkey]] ‘proposed to [[Israel]] a formal [[alliance]] which 
[[Israel]], [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Turkey]] would join on equal terms 
as the four allies of the US in the region’. Although no [[Israel]]i 
commentator said so explicitly, the proposal didn’t seem to arouse 
any enchantment, whether official or non-official and [[Israel]] clearly 
rejected it. It is particularly noteworthy that the [[Israel]]i Foreign 
Minister, Shimon Peres who is so busy advocating ‘a regional </p>
<p>74 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[alliance]] system’ said not a word in commendation of the Turkish 
[[alliance]]. The ‘encouragements’ of the ‘officials in the State 
Department’ have turned out to be of no avail. The talks merely 
articulated the funda[[mental]] disagreements between [[Turkey]] and 
[[Israel]], even though Weizman’s visit was officially characterized as 
‘extraordinarily successful’ (31 [[January]]). </p>
<p>As reported by Ben on 31 [[January]], the main bones of contention 
were over [[nuclear]] politics, the attitude towards [[Iran]] and the policy 
toward Syria, with their implications for the Kurdish question and 
the so-called ‘struggle against terror and the drug [[trade]]’. Ben’s 
comment on the central issues at stake seems to be well-taken: ‘Just 
as [[Israel]] hesitates whether to attack Syria, which is [[Turkey]]’s enemy 
number one, [[Turkey]] hesitates whether to declare publicly its enmity 
towards [[Iran]], which is [[Israel]]’s enemy number one’. It turns out that 
[[Israel]] queried [[Turkey]] ‘whether the latter is as concerned by [[Iran]]’s 
[[nuclear]]ization efforts as is [[Israel]]. But [[President]] Sule1man Demirel 
and the Prime Minister answered [[[Israel]]] by hinting that [[Israel]] is 
no less involved than [[Iran]]. They said that “we oppose proliferation 
of [[nuclear]] weapons in all Middle [[Eastern]] states.”” Demirel further 
said that “he did not know” whether [[Iran]] indeed wanted to produce 
[[nuclear]] weapons, adding a transparent allusion to the effect that “[[Iran]] 
does not talk about it.” The [[Israel]]is reacted by pressing him: “And 
do you believe the [[Iran]]ians?” To that his answer was the same in a 
different phrasing: “They are denying it.” </p>
<p>The discussion of the nature of [[Iran]]ian regime also ended in talk 
at cross purposes. [[Israel]] pressed [[Turkey]] to denounce the ‘[[Iran]]ian 
funda[[mental]]ist regime’, arguing that ‘as a secular state [[Turkey]] has 
a duty to do so.’ The Turks responded that ‘in our view the 
character of a regime is a purely internal affair of every state.’ Ben 
is quite displeased by the Turkish positions on both issues. In his 
article of 11 [[January]] he quotes [[Israel]]i ‘experts’ who, even prior to 
the high-level negotiations, communicated to their Turkish 
counterparts their dissatisfaction that ‘the [[Iran]]ian Vice [[President]], 
Hassan Habibi, had visited Ankara in [[December]] [[1993]]’, and that 
even earlier ‘the [[Iran]]ian Foreign Minister had also visited [[Turkey]]’. 
The ‘experts’ admonished the Turkish [[government]] for ignoring ‘the 
deadly insult to [[Turkey]]’ on the part of both visitors ‘who refused 
to lay a wreath on Ataturk’s tomb’. Catching the [[Israel]]i ‘experts’ 
off-guard, the Turkish response was that ‘although [[Turkey]] does 
speak up against [[Iran]]ian and Syrian support of Kurdish terrorism, 
it 1s vitally interested in cooperating with the two states to solve 
the Kurdish question.’ In line with that, [[Turkey]] announced that 
its overriding interest lay in [[Iran]]’s fulfilment of promises made by 
Hassan Habibi during his visit, to the effect that ‘[[Iran]] and [[Turkey]] 
shall strike powerfully at terrorism and cooperate in finding new </p>
<p>COALITION BUILDING AGAINST IRAN bee, </p>
<p>ways of guarding their common frontier against it.” Compared to 
that, symbolic gestures were defined as secondary. </p>
<p>It seems that Turkish and [[Israel]]i negotiators spent much of their 
time discussing Syria, the Kurdish implications of the problem 
included. In his 11 [[January]] article Ben reports that “[[Turkey]] asked 
[[Israel]] to demand that as a precondition for signing a peace [[treaty]] 
Syria stops supporting Kurdish terrorism and close all Kurdish 
offices and bases, in Syria and in [[Lebanon]] alike’, and that the US 
was approached by [[Turkey]] with the same demand. In his 31 [[January]] 
article Ben reports that ‘during Weizman’s visit all pro-[[government]] 
Turkish journalists completely ignored the Palestinians and [[Israel]]i 
intentions in regard to the [[Territories]]. Instead of asking any 
questions about Palestine-related issues, they kept asking Weizman 
whether [[Israel]] would welcome an independent Kurdish state and 
what is [[Israel]]’s attitude towards the Kurdish terror.’ Ben doesn’t 
bother to say how Weizman answered these questions but he 
mentions that ‘on such occasions Weizman talked about [[Assad]]’s 
importance for the peace process.’ Such evasion was not likely to 
please his questioners. Ben also mentions some alternative official 
‘Turkish proposals, one to the effect of issuing a joint condemnation 
of terror ‘in which [[Turkey]] would condemn Hizbollah and [[Israel]] 
the PKP, the strongest Kurdish terror organization’; and the second 
to the effect of ‘[[Israel]]i promises to help [[Turkey]] in its struggle 
against terror, at least by explicitly condemning the PKP’, preferably 
by ‘signing a pledge in which the two countries would fight terror 
and the drug [[trade]] together. The [[Israel]]is answered that these 
proposals needed to be carefully examined. In the meantime, 
therefore, such [Turkish] ideas hang in the air. ‘The only thing [[Israel]] 
agreed to was to set up a joint committee for the purpose of 
strategic consultations and an exchange of political assessments of 
the “regional threats”’.’ Apart from that, the only thing [[Turkey]] could 
obtain was Weizman’s declaration, described by Ben as ‘not 
committing [[Israel]] to anything concrete’. Weizman said that ‘every 
organization which carries out terrorist actions is a terrorist 
organization’, without naming any such ‘organization’. After the 
visit ended, the disapointed Turkish press deplored ‘[[Israel]]’s unwise 
refusal to sign formal [[treaties]] against terror’, and claimed that, unlike 
[[Israel]], “[[Turkey]] believes in open diplomacy.’ </p>
<p>Ben and Karni make it clear that [[Israel]]i rejection of Turkish 
proposals did not stem from any sympathy for the Kurds. If 
anything, [[Israel]] is now quite hostile toward them. But, as Ben puts 
it in his 31 [[January]] article, ‘[[Israel]] refuses to make any public 
statements which might be interpreted adversely by Syria while 
hoping that [[alliance]] with [[Turkey]] “will make a fellow in Damascus 
sweat a little”.’ Karni recounts a long [[history]] of [[Israel]]i relations with 
the Iraqi Kurds. The story goes back to the [[1950]]s, but the relations </p>
<p>76 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>were abruptly severed in [[1975]] to please the Shah after his deal with 
Saddam Hussein. The details of that deal are too well known to 
be retold here. Karni, however, says nothing about a later phase 
of [[Israel]]i relations with Iraqi Kurds which occurred after the end 
of the Gulf [[War]]. During the entire Gulf Crisis and [[War]], [[Israel]], 
seconded by its foreign friends, was supporting the Iraqi Kurds and 
their national and individual rights. But in [[March]] [[1991]], the then 
[[Israel]]i Chief of Staff, General Dan Shomron, formed a ‘broad 
Knesset coalition’, comprising politicians from all the parties in 
support of Saddam Hussein. Let me quote the argument of MK 
Avraham Burg, a Labor ‘dove’ in favor of joining that coalition: 
‘Unless Saddam Hussein is supported, a vast Shi’ite [[empire]] 
extending from [[Iran]] up to the Occupied [[Territories]] will become a 
real prospect.’ Some supporters of such a pro-Iraqi coalition, such 
as Moshe Zak (Jerusalem Post, 4 [[April]] [[1991]]) explained that it 
implied leaving the Iraqi Kurds to their own devices, because 
‘Syria and [[Iran]] are lodged behind the Kurdish revolt and hoping 
to create a territorial link between them.’ In vaguer language, other 
commentators hinted that [[Israel]] and [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] were jointly 
exerting their in[[flu]]ence in [[Washington]] to convince the US to go 
along with the scheme. Avner Tavori (Davar, 4 [[April]] [[1991]]) wrote 
that ‘any attempt to introduce democracy to Iraq may only result 
in its partition into a Kurdish state in the north, a Sunni state in 
the center around Baghdad and a pro-[[Iran]]ian Shiite state in the 
south, which would be located too close to [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] to please 
it.’ There are reasons to presume that [[Israel]]i policies are still based 
on such assumptions, even if they are also informed by contempt 
for all the ‘Orientals’ and fear of democracy in any Arab country. </p>
<p>Karni writes that since the early [[1960]]s [[Israel]] has been consistently 
helping [[Turkey]] by [[white]]washing, especially in the US, its soiled 
record of human rights violations. Whitewashing extended as far 
back as the Turkish genocide of Armenians during World [[War]] I: 
‘[[Israel]]i diplomats in [[Washington]] were mobilized to use their 
in[[flu]]ence in the [[Congress]] to try to squash a law establishing the 
[Armenian] memorial day in [[1989]].’ But Karni also provides 
examples of [[Israel]]i attempts to prevent or at least to postpone 
holding symposia discussing the Armenian or Kurdish question from 
either the human rights or the historic point of view. He does not 
object to such practices in principle, because ‘we should not be 
sanctimonious when [[Israel]] is pursuing its legitimate interests in this 
affair’, or elsewhere in the Third World. Yet he says that ‘no 
survival imperative can command [[Israel]] to lie non-stop for the sake 
of profits obtainable in relations with a foreign state for our weapons 
industry. The [[Israel]]i [[government]] and even more so a [[President]] of 
[[Israel]] whose authority is limited to purely ceremonial matters, can 
afford to occasionally say something in public in praise of democratic 
foreign policy that would place moral considerations above </p>
<p>COALITION BUILDING AGAINST IRAN vay </p>
<p>profitability.’ This can only be interpreted as meaning that Karni 
wants [[Israel]] to be even more sanctimonious than it is. </p>
<p>Roughly the same is the attitude of Motti Zaken (Davar, 31 
[[January]]), introduced as ‘the chairman of the [[Israel]]i Association of 
Friendship with Kurdistan’, a curious organization almost hardly 
ever heard of in [[Israel]] but quite active among the Kurds in [[Europe]]. 
Zaken objects to [[Israel]]i pro-Turkish and anti-Kurdish gestures, but 
especially if they are publicized. After repeating Ben’s story about 
the cooperation of [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] against the Kurds, he says: ‘It 
is impossible not to compare [[Israel]]i and [[Iran]]ian conduct in matters 
which for the Muslims’ own good should be better Kept secret from 
them. Yet [[Israel]] stridently talks about a policy which some may 
find objectionable, already at its designing stage.’ After such a 
preamble, the reader is caught off-guard by the writer’s demand 
for a ‘public and [[parliament]]ary debate’ about [[Israel]]i policies towards 
the Kurds. Zaken speaks about ‘love’ which supposedly existed 
between the Kurds and the Kurdish Jews in order to advocate a 
return to pro-Kurdish policies [[Israel]] once pursued. But in spite of 
his recommendation of a debate, he utters no single word about 
how would he envisage those ‘pro-Kurdish policies’. Unlike Karni, 
he does not even call upon the [[President]] to ‘say something in public’. </p>
<p>Minimalistic as the proposals of Karni and Zaken are, there is 
no hope that they will be put into effect. Even Aluf Ben’s lucid views 
on the problems dividing [[Israel]] from [[Turkey]] do not square with 
what the majority of [[Israel]]i commentators have written on the 
subject. To give a notion of a typical account of [[Israel]]i-Turkish 
relations, let me briefly quote Yoram Levy from Davar of 31 
[[January]]. The relations between [[Israel]] and [[Turkey]] are for Levy based 
on ‘love’ and ‘true friendship’ and secondarily on their common 
attitude toward ‘Kurdish terrorism’, which in his view Syria supports 
for the same reasons it supports Hizbollah. He doesn’t even hint 
that this ‘love’ and ‘true friendship’ may be somewhat ragged. </p>
<p>The evidence presented here can only corroborate the conclusions 
about the more independent nature of [[Israel]]i foreign policies 
reached earlier. At the time of the ‘periphery [[alliance]]’ [[Israel]] was 
quite satisfied with its status of an equal partner with three other 
US allies, among which [[Turkey]] was the most important. The 
Camp David Accords and the peace with [[Egypt]] conformed explicitly 
to the principle of equality between the two states and tacitly to 
the fact of their common dependence on the US. Now, however, 
[[Israel]] insists that its special status, superior to all other Middle 
[[Eastern]] states, be explicitly acknowledged. The case of the failed 
[[Israel]]i negotiations with [[Turkey]] proves that [[Israel]] was guided in 
them by hegemonic ambitions. Regardless of whether the [[Clinton]] 
administration bows to such [[Israel]]i pretensions, they cannot be 
brought about except by force. And hence the hazards they invite. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i Foreign Policies, [[August]] [[1994]] 
8 [[August]] [[1994]] </p>
<p>The scope of [[Israel]]i foreign policies can be said to be truly world- 
wide. This is especially the case when, in the wake of recent terrorist 
assaults against [[Israel]]i and Jewish targets in Buenos Aires and 
London, the [[Israel]]i [[government]] professed the eradication of all such 
terror in the entire world as its aim. At the same time, however, 
due to [[Israel]]i automatic attribution of responsibility for all those 
assaults to [[Iran]], [[Israel]]i foreign policies are also firmly anchored in 
the region of the Middle East. It can even be conjectured that the 
primary purpose of the [[Washington]] [[treaty]] with Jordan recently 
signed by Rabin and [[King]] Hussein was not so much to make peace 
as to seek to use Jordanian territory for action against [[Iran]]. And 
the same purpose was by no means absent from the “peace process’ 
pursued earlier with Arafat. Here I will deal with the [[Israel]]i anti- 
[[Iran]]ian propaganda campaign which is being intensified: its policy 
context clearly being the Middle East in the widest possible meaning 
of that term, that is, extending from Afghanistan to Morocco, the 
Muslim republics of the former USSR included. </p>
<p>Let me proceed to discuss the strategic significance of the [[Israel]]i 
Accord with Jordan. It is both defensive and offensive. Jordan 
commits itself not to allow any third state’s army to enter its 
territory. (But there is no mention of a possible entry of the [[Israel]]i 
Army into Jordan.) Most [[Israel]]i commentators understood this 
stipulation as precluding the threat of the so-called ‘[[Eastern]] Front’, 
that 1s, of allied Arab armies attacking [[Israel]] from the east. Even 
though [[Israel]]’s border with Jordan is more difficult to defend than 
its [[Egypt]]ian border, the whole notion has in my view long belonged 
to the realm of fiction. With the Jordanian border secure and a firm 
peace with [[Egypt]], only the borders with Syria and [[Lebanon]] remain 
hostile. They are relatively short, allowing for heavy concentrations 
of troops and fire, the preferred [[Israel]]i method of [[warfare]]. The 
prospect of so shortening the potential front line has been discussed 
for a long tme in professional military magazines of the [[Israel]]i Army. 
But [[Israel]]i strategists are also keenly aware of the two-fold 
importance of the Irbid area of Jordan, located just south of the 
Golan Heights and Syria. By penetrating this area, the Syrian </p>
<p>78 </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY - AUGUST [[1994]] 719 </p>
<p>Army could outflank the [[Israel]]i troops deployed in the Golan 
Heights. By penetrating the same area, however, the [[Israel]]i Army 
could outflank the bulk of the Syrian Army, entrenched in its 
fortifications opposite the Golan Heights, and speedily advance 
toward Damascus. Now, the [[Israel]]i military [[alliance]] with Jordan 
(which is what the agreement with that country amounts to), 
precludes the former prospect while enhancing the likelihood of 
the latter. All too clearly, it poses a major threat to Syria. </p>
<p>Sull, the most likely target of a possible [[Israel]]i armed attack is 
at the present moment [[Iran]]. Oren (Davar, 7 [[January]] [[1994]]) views 
the agreement with Jordan primarily in that context: “The agreement 
is intended to establish a military [[alliance]] between [[Israel]] and Jordan 
and thus extend the boundary of [[Israel]]’s military presence to the 
eastern tip of the Jordanian desert. [[Israel]]’s undisguised military 
presence there, right on the border of Iraq, means that the route 
of its war planes to [[Iran]] will be hundreds of kilometres shorter.’ 
Had they had to take off from [[Israel]]i territory, only the most 
advanced [[Israel]]i planes, practically only the F-15s, could reach [[Iran]] 
without refuelling in the air. A glance of the map of the Middle 
East will suffice to show that the Iraqi—Jordanian border area is 
already quite close to [[Iran]]: close enough to let [[Israel]] use its plentiful 
older model planes (or [[missile]]s) for [[bomb]]ing raids on [[Iran]] after 
overflying the Iraqi territory. Oren does expect Jordan ‘to grant the 
[[Israel]]i Air Force the right to overfly its territory, at least in emergency 
situations.’ Sure enough, the use of Jordanian territory for a possible 
assault of [[Iran]] implies the existence of a tacit Iraqi complicity with 
[[Israel]]. Oren must imply no less than that when he says that once 
[[Israel]]i [[alliance]] with Jordan is fully operational, ‘Rafsanjani will be 
compelled to approach [[Israel]] with greater restraint than to date.’ 
In more general terms Oren opines that ‘just as [[Israel]] had opened 
the flow of [[America]]n dollars to Sadat and enabled the [[Egypt]]ian 
Air Force to receive advanced planes from the US within no more 
than year and a half after Sadat’s visit to Jerusalem, so the Rabin 
[[government]] which enabled Jordan to receive not a few US dollars, 
will feel entitled to use its agreement with Jordan not just for the 
sake of the military status quo, but in order to improve [[Israel]]’s 
military strength considerably, to the point of letting the [[Israel]]i Air 
Force and eventually Intelligence reach the western boundary of 
Iraq.’ In my view, this crucial change in strategic configurations in 
the Middle East either has already occurred or is likely to occur in 
the coming months. </p>
<p>I feel tempted at this point to digress in order to recount some 
new revelations about the past relations of the Zionist movement 
and the State of [[Israel]] with the Hashemite regime in Jordan. A 
veteran of Haganah’s Intelligence Service, Yo’av Gelber, recently 
published a book bearing the title The Roots of the Lily, (the lily being </p>
<p>80 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>the emblem of [[Israel]]i Military Intelligence), which heavily relies 
on documents declassified only in recent years. According to 
Gelber, [[King]] Hussein’s grandfather, Abdullah, was recruited as a 
[[spy]] for the Zionist movement in the early [[1920]]s, soon after being 
appointed ‘Emir of Trans-Jordan’ by the [[British]]. He was instructed 
to [[spy]] on all sorts of Arab leaders, but his main task was to [[spy]] on 
his [[British]] masters. Heaps of documents depict Zionist intra- 
agency squabbles over whether Abdullah’s demands for payment 
for each rendered service should be fully respected or subject to 
some bargaining, the late Moshe Sharett being a consistent advocate 
of the latter. All payments to Abdullah were in cash directly 
delivered to him. Other intra-agency disputes were over Abdullah’s 
occasional demands to be paid not in banknotes, but in [[gold]] coins. 
In addition to this, one of Abdullah’s wives was put on the Zionist 
payroll to [[spy]] on her husband. Gelber boasts that the [[British]] 
discovered the whole scheme only after more than twenty years, 
in [[1946]]. Their reaction was not only to offer Abdullah more money 
than the Zionist movement could possibly pay, but also to give more 
military aid for Abdullah’s army. Most importantly, however, they 
dangled before him a vision of becoming king of ‘the greater Syria’ 
— Syria, [[Lebanon]] and Palestine together. This displeased Ben- 
Gurion greatly, and relations between the Zionist movement and 
subsequently the State of [[Israel]] with Jordan dwindled to a 
coordination of policy directed, as Oren defines it, ‘against their 
common enemy, Palestinian nationalism’. </p>
<p>A fuller cooperation between [[Israel]] and Jordan was revived by 
[[King]] Hussein in [[1958]], right after the [[revolution]] in Iraq in which 
his close relatives from the Iraqi royal family perished. As Oren puts 
it, Hussein ‘sent his Armenian Intelligence advisor to [[Israel]]’ with 
dispatch. On the Jordanian side cooperation with [[Israel]] was carried 
through solely by the kingdom’s Armenian or Circassian 
functionaries. Azarya Alon (Davar, 28 [[July]]) informs us that one 
unit guarding [[King]] Hussein is comprised solely of Circassians and 
considers this fact advantageous to [[Israel]]. </p>
<p>The [[Israel]]i [[alliance]] with [[King]] Hussein endured until [[1965]]. Oren 
points out that, as subsequently revealed by declassified [[America]]n 
documents, George [[Bush]], acting in capacity of [[CIA]] Director had 
in that year offered [[King]] Hussein personal payment. [[Bush]]’s scheme 
was considered in [[Israel]] hostile and it was recalled when he became 
[[President]]. But Hussein again became subservient to [[Israel]] before 
the “Black [[September]]’ of [[1970]]. After that date he became a virtual 
[[Israel]]i [[spy]], as his grandfather had been. As is well known, it was 
he who in [[September]] [[1973]] forewarned Golda Meir about the 
incipient attack of [[Egypt]] and Syria on [[Israel]], although he was not 
believed. Good relations have been maintained since, regardless 
of which party ruled [[Israel]]. As was reported by the Hebrew press </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY - AUGUST [[1994]] 81 </p>
<p>on the occasion of the present [[Washington]] Accord, Shamir had 
met [[King]] Hussein in London even during the Gulf Crisis, in 
[[November]] [[1990]], in order to assure him that unless Iraqi land 
forces are let into Jordan, [[Israel]] was not going to invade it, even in 
the case of it launching hostilities against Iraq. The present 
[[Israel]]i-Jordanian [[alliance]] is therefore the crowning point of decades 
of thinly disguised cooperation. </p>
<p>Let me now quote at some length an instructive portrayal of [[Israel]]i 
relations with Morocco by Daniel Ben-Simon writing in Davar 
(7 [[June]]). After gloating about how excellent the relations between 
the two countries have been, Ben-Simon admits that ‘the web of 
relations between the two states rests on the shoulders of a single 
individual: [[King]] Hassan II. Morocco’s kindness toward [[Israel]] and 
all the Jews depends solely on his feelings ... Only a few thousand 
Jews have remained in Morocco: most of them in Casablanca 
where they are among the wealthiest people. Hassan II has highly 
appreciated the Jewish contribution to the development of his 
country. When the [[French]] left in [[1954]], the Jews tended to replace 
them in their occupations in industry and commerce.’ Ben-Simon 
fails to understand that if the Jews ‘replaced’ the [[French]] in Morocco 
with the effect of becoming very wealthy in the process, then the 
same grudges which ordinary Moroccans had had against the 
[[French]] and their role in Morocco are now likely to be revived against 
the Jews. </p>
<p>Ben-Simon continues: ‘Hassan II has a weakness for [[Israel]]. To 
many of his visitors he expressed his admiration for [[Israel]]’s ability 
to turn wilderness into a fertile land. He does not hide his belief 
that Jews are cleverer than other nations, and that economic, social 
and cultural [[revolution]]s and progress were a product of Jewish 
genius. In the early [[1970]]s, when the hostility between [[Israel]] and 
the Arab states reached its peak, he indulged in fanciful reveries 
about what could be achieved by blending Jewish genius with Arab 
capital. “If there is peace, the Middle East may in this way become 
the strongest power on earth”, he used to say.’ This sounds not 
unlike the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. </p>
<p>But such visions for the future depend on a purely personal 
factor: “Hassan II is an absolute monarch, one of the few such still 
left in the world. All state affairs depends on his decisions and orders. 
In theory, Morocco has a constitution and democratic institutions. 
But their impact is very limited. In practice, everything is 
subordinated to his will. In the West, Hassan II succeeded in 
manufacturing for himself an image of an enlightened, open- 
minded, liberal, educated king who relies on democratic institutions. 
Consequently, the western countries would turn a blind eye to 
oddities of that democracy, and content themselves with the 
existence of many parties and periodic elections in Morocco. </p>
<p>82 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Hassan II fights like a lion to maintain this image. It was not too 
easy, after books appeared depicting his regime as one of the most 
obscurantist in the world. A [[French]] journalist Gilles Perrault wrote 
a book documenting the outrages committed by the [[King]]’s regime, 
in the first place the atrocities in treating the regime’s opponents. 
The [[King]] not only banned the book, but also sought to prevail upon 
[[President]] Mitterrand to do the same in [[France]]. Regardless of 
whatever Mitterand might have wanted, the [[French]] law precluded 
the possibility of his satisfying the [[King]]. </p>
<p>‘On several occasions, the [[King]] would berate his [[Western]] critics, 
“Do you want Morocco to become an Islamic state like [[Iran]]? Just 
say so”, he would reply to queries about his misdeeds. [[Western]] 
countries do realize that they can ill afford another state resembling 
[[Algeria]] or [[Iran]]. This is why western [[government]]s prefer to turn a 
blind eye on whatever the [[King]] might do and speculate about 
what may happen after Hassan II. If he just retires he will be 
succeeded by the [[Crown]] Prince Sidi Mohammed. The [[Crown]] 
Prince is a very different character than his father, gentle, refined, 
with a penchant for romanticism. Some in the West would prefer 
the [[King]] to appoint his younger son, Moulay Rashid, as his 
successor. Like his father, Moulay Rashid is tough, determined to 
hold on to power at any price. He wants to be [[Crown]] Prince in 
order to assure that the country toes the pro-[[Western]] line. If 
Morocco remains a monarchy, its further rapprochement with 
[[Israel]] can be expected. If monarchy is abolished there, everything 
becomes possible. Then, the very survival of the tiny Jewish 
community in Morocco may also be in doubt. For in Morocco, 
everything depends on the will of our friend, the [[King]].’ I guess that 
‘some in the West’ is Ben-Simon’s codename for [[Israel]]i Intelligence 
whose links with Hassan II have been notorious. But his whole 
[[treatment]] of [[Israel]]i relations with the Moroccan regime shows 
how much [[Israel]] and the organized Jewish communities 1n the 
Diaspora have always tended to support despotic regimes, especially 
in the Muslim world. </p>
<p>Let me return to [[Iran]], on which [[Israel]]i foreign policies currently 
focus. Prior to the last wave of terrorist attacks on Jewish targets 
in Buenos Aires and London the situation in this respect was 
summed up by Aluf Ben ([[Haaretz]], 12 [[July]]), whose article deserves 
to be quoted at some length: ‘During the last two years the [[Iran]]ian 
threat has been the central element in [[Israel]]’s foreign and security 
policy. After the Gulf [[War]] ruined [[Iran]]’s rival Iraq, [[Iran]] emerged 
more powerful than ever. [[Israel]] feared that [[Iran]] could aspire to 
regional hegemony and ruin the peace process by virtue of having 
[[nuclear]] weapons and long-range [[missile]]s, of building a modern air 
force and navy, of exporting terrorism and [[revolution]] and of 
subverting Arab secular regimes.’ Let me observe that when (as </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY - AUGUST [[1994]] 83 </p>
<p>plenty of other evidence shows) [[Israel]] ‘after the Gulf [[War]]’ decided 
that [[Iran]] was its enemy number one, the latter was still exhausted 
after the lengthy war with Iraq and hadn’t yet begun its 
[[nuclear]]ization. Really, [[Israel]]i enmity toward [[Iran]] stemmed from 
the fact that it ‘could aspire to [the] regional hegemony’ to which 
[[Israel]] aspires. ‘Last year Rabin said that [[Iran]] was the main threat 
to [[Israel]]’s security. The Chief of Staff Ehud Barak described the 
monster of Tehran as the most ternble danger to peace in the whole 
world. Why? Because [[Iran]] undermines political stability in the 
Middle East, because it opposes the flow of oil to the developed 
world and because it wants to upset the cultural equilibrium 
between the West and Islam. “The [[Iran]]ian regime poses a danger 
to the very foundations of world order”, said Barak.’ I believe the 
quote from Barak is authentic, but I don’t know where he said it. 
Certainly, it has never been published before. Although I don’t 
disregard the dangers such utterances may entail, the spectacle of 
an [[Israel]]i general concerned about the potential upsetting of ‘the 
cultural equilibrium between the West and Islam’ strikes me as 
having its comic side as well. </p>
<p>Commenting on a terrorist attack on Jewish targets, on 29 [[July]], 
Uzi Mahanaimi wrote in Shishi: “The [[Iran]]ians are now busy hiring 
foreign experts to make the little gifts they obtained fully operational. 
Is this perhaps why [[Israel]] vacillates about knocking the downtown 
of ‘Tehran with all its might? Is somebody in [[Israel]] afraid that the 
madmen in Tehran may already possess the [[bomb]]? Is this the 
reason they cannot be touched? I hope things are not that bad. I 
find it absolutely clear that as long as the heads of the [[Iran]]ians do 
not get whacked, and as long as [[Israel]] keeps playing its games with 
Hizbollah in [[Lebanon]], our embassies cannot but continue to be 
blown up.’ Mahanaimi has no doubt that the [[Iran]]ians ‘are 
responsible for the [[bomb]]ing of our embassy and Jewish Centre in 
Buenos Aires’. He claims that ‘the proofs of this abound’, but he 
mentions only one, namely that ‘through their Argentinian embassy 
the [[Iran]]ians denied any connection with the outrage.’ Why should 
the denial be a proof? Mahanaimi’s argument runs as follows: ‘I 
know them bloody well. This is why I can say with confidence that 
had [[Israel]] reacted properly to the [[bomb]]ing of its embassy in 
[[Argentina]] two years ago, the [[Iran]]ians would have thought twice 
before sending their saboteurs once again. After the first [[bomb]]ing 
in [[Argentina]], it was the Commander of [[Israel]]i Military Intelligence 
who accused the [[Iran]]ians of complicity. Not a journalist voicing 
his opinion, but the very Commander of [[Israel]]i Military Intelligence 
said that. Why did [[Israel]] do nothing then? After all, if Katyushas 
are fired upon the Galilee, [[Israel]] escalates almost to the point of a 
war. So why didn’t we react likewise when our entire embassy was 
blown sky high? The [[Iran]]ians have plenty of sensitive targets across </p>
<p>84 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>their country. Hitting them could make the Ayatollahs think twice 
before they play with fire next time.’ And so on and so forth. </p>
<p>Ron Ben-Yishay (Yediot Ahronot, 29 [[July]]) says that ‘Intelligence 
sources estimate that one and the same hand in Tehran was behind 
the terrorist assault in Buenos Aires, the Hizbollah attacks in 
[[Lebanon]] and the two terrorist assaults in London’: the operational 
medium being the ‘[[Iran]]ian Intelligence officers masquerading as 
diplomats and working in all [[Iran]]ian embassies the world over’. Ben- 
Yishay claims that ‘until two weeks ago’ [[Israel]] did nothing against 
[[Iran]] ‘except abuse it verbally’, but now ‘many [[Israel]]i politicians, 
including the Prime Minister, believe that [[Israel]] should hit the 
[[Iran]]ians right where it hurts.’ Ben-Yishay does not seem to mean 
by that an armed attack on [[Iran]]ian territory, but only a world-wide 
elimination of whomever [[Israel]] may label as an ‘[[Iran]]ian’ terrorist. 
This transpires from his saying that [[Israel]] ‘should treat all [[Iran]]ian 
terrorists as it treated the PLO’s international terror after the [[1970]] 
Black [[September]]’. He refers to [[Israel]]i Intelligence then [[kill]]ing 
Palestinians and other Arabs (including some innocent people like 
a Moroccan waiter mistakenly identified as a PLO agent in 
Lilienhammer, Norway), but stopping short of doing anything 
more violent. Ben-Yishay says that ‘the dragon is already too 
powerful for [[Israel]] to slay it alone’. He hopes the western states 
will help [[Israel]] in its struggle against the [[Iran]]ian dragon. </p>
<p>However, voices advocating some caution and moderation have 
resounded as well. Let me quote two. A Labor Party stalwart 
Shalom Yerushalmi writing in Maanv (3 [[August]]), admits that ‘in 
[[Lebanon]] [[Israel]] did commit against Hizbollah, the operational arm 
of Khomeinism some “eliminations” [[Iran]]ian style, e.g the Sheikh 
Mussawi affair [[[murdered]] together with his family] or kidnappings, 
e.g. of Sheikhs Obeid and Dirani. It is not clear what [[Israel]] gained 
thereby, but there also have been massive [[bomb]]ardments of civilian 
populations. I think we should stop playing such dangerous games.’ 
Yerushalmi advises Rabin to follow in the footsteps of Shamir’s 
judicious conduct during the Gulf [[War]]. Shamir then merely 
threatened that [[Israel]] would retaliate but didn’t follow his threats 
through. But restraint toward [[Iran]] would, argues Yerushalmi, be 
even more advisable now than in the past toward Iraq. [[Iran]] is 
stronger than Iraq, larger in size and population. The war against 
Iraq was really ‘only a war against an insane dictator and a handful 
of his henchmen’, whereas [[Iran]]ians are in their majority ‘united in 
their support for the mad ideology hammered into their heads by 
the Ayatollahs’. Yerushalmi advises Rabin to ask the West to 
impose ‘some potent economic sanctions against [[Iran]]’, paired with 
a propaganda campaign to the effect that [[Iran]]ian [[nuclear]]ization 
threatens everybody. </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY - AUGUST [[1994]] 85 </p>
<p>Even more interesting are the views of some components of 
[[Israel]]i and apparently also US intelligence as relayed by Tzvi Bar’el 
in [[Haaretz]] (24 [[July]]). Contrary to the quoted commentators who 
believe (presumably after being briefed by the [[Israel]]i Prime 
Minister’s Office) that [[Iran]] was solely responsible for the Buenos 
Aires and London terrorist assaults, Bar’el quotes ‘a senior [[Israel]]i 
Intelligence source’ as telling him that ‘the working presumption 
[of [[Israel]]i Intelligence] is that the assault was committed by local 
terrorists hired for pay, the money being traceable to Hizbollah. 
The same source claims that the [[Iran]]ian connection amounts only 
to political and economic patronage [[Iran]] bestows on Hizbollah: “I 
presume that under different political circumstances [[Israel]] could 
blame Syria or [[Libya]] in the same way as it now accuses [[Iran]]. In 
the same way it was once customary to blame the former USSR 
for standing behind terrorist acts which gained international 
publicity”.’ Bar’el contrasts this point of view with Rabin’s and 
Netanyahu’s views. Rabin ‘rushed to announce that [[Iran]] was 
responsible. After a while, without retracting the first version, he 
pinned the responsiblity on Hizbollah.’ Incidentally, this seems to 
be Rabin’s fagon de parler. When the Intifada had just broken out 
he rushed to blame [[Iran]] and [[Libya]] for their ‘exclusive responsibility’ 
for it. This stupid falsehood was then, for some time, elevated to 
the rank of [[Israel]]i propaganda line. Rabin’s mendacity borders on 
the pathological, even more so than Sharon’s or Shamir’s. The 
western media only show how biased they are when they fail to 
document Rabin’s systematic lying. Netanyahu surpasses even 
Rabin in mendacity. According to Bar’el, Netanyahu opined that 
‘Tran, Hizbollah and Syria were equally responsible.’ A record in 
lying, however, has been attained in this affair by the [[Israel]]i Chief 
of Staff, Ehud Barak. He is reported by On Levy (Davar, 3 [[August]]) 
to have said that ‘the intelligence community of the entire world 
knows for sure that [[Iran]] stands behind the terror.’ Dissenting from 
Rabin, Netanyahu and Barak alike, Bar’el reports that ‘[[Israel]]i 
Intelligence has so far failed to find evidence linking the Buenos 
Aires terror with any of the three factors’, that is, with ‘[[Iran]], 
Hizbollah and Syria’. </p>
<p>But Bar’el makes also some fairly keen observations about the 
nature of state terror, which deserve to be quoted at length: ‘[[Iran]] 
is a terror state in the same way as Iraq, [[Libya]] or Syria. But the 
list of terror states can be extended. Not so long ago [[Argentina]], 
Chile and [[South]] [[Africa]] qualified as well by virtue of committing 
routinely political murders or terrorist assaults against dissenters 
living outside their borders.’ Let me comment that [[Israel]], and 
especially the Labor Party was chummy with the three regimes 
named here as terrorists. Rabin particularly cultivated close relations 
with the [[South]] [[Africa]]n apartheid regime. Helped by his present </p>
<p>86 OPEN. SECRETS </p>
<p>Defence Deputy Minister Motta Gur, he advanced the ties with 
Argentinian and Chilean juntas. ‘Sull’, continues Bar’el, ‘some states 
can be said to be more terroristic than others. At the present 
moment, by far the most terrorist state in the Middle East, and 
perhaps in the entire world, is Afghanistan. As estimated by various 
intelligence experts, most subversive and terrorist acts against Arab 
regimes were committed by veterans of the war against communism, 
or of the tribal war continuing to grip that country till this very day. 
The Afghan [[government]] and other authorities maintain training 
programmes in terror for the cohorts of volunteers who for this very 
purpose come to Afghanistan. </p>
<p>‘Paradoxically, however, Afghanistan is not defined as a terror 
state. Instead, it is glorified by the US as a nation of valiant patriots 
who expelled the [[Soviet]] invaders. On the opposite side, the US seeks 
to overthrow Saddam Hussein not because his henchmen have 
committed lots of terrorist acts but because he poses a threat to 
US interests in the Middle East ... Fortunately for [[Israel]], [[Iran]] is 
nowadays an easy target to be branded as a terror state ... Its 
diplomats have admittedly been found to be involved in some 
terrorist acts, but acts aimed only at exiled [[Iran]]ian political 
dissenters. [[Iran]] is a funda[[mental]]ist state, but no more so than [[Saudi]] 
[[Arabia]] or the Islamic opposition in [[Algeria]]. Yet the US has the best 
of relations with the former and is perfectly prepared to parley with 
the latter. </p>
<p>“The crucial factor which helps uphold the definition of [[Iran]] as 
a terror state is the non-operational character of such a definition. 
By itself, the definition cannot authorize [[Israel]] to dispatch its Air 
Force to raid some targets on [[Iran]]ian territory. Nor can it by itself 
warrant the imposition of economic sanctions on [[Iran]], aggravating 
its economic plight. Intelligence experts commonly estimate that 
acts of retaliation directed against [[Iran]]ian targets would hardly deter 
[[Iran]] while mounting trouble for [[Israel]]. A senior foreign intelligence 
source told me that in the absence of decisive evidence linking the 
recent terrorist assaults to [[Iran]], the definition of [[Iran]] (or of any 
other state for that matter) as a terror state discredits a state 
advancing such a definition because it brings into relief the dismal 
failure of its intelligence. Talking of “decisive evidence”, my 
interlocutor meant evidence as decisive as that found by the US 
linking the [[Libya]]n [[government]] with the terrorist act in Berlin 
discotheque.’ This ‘senior foreign intelligence source’ sounds as if 
he were an [[America]]n. </p>
<p>Bar’el formulates an interpretation of what he heard from this 
presumed [[America]]n intelligence source: ‘In other words, the more 
vague a given state’s concept of the sources of terrorism, the more 
its intelligence can be faulted for incompetence. As the same source 
put it, “occasionally you may have good intelligence as in some cases </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY —- AUGUST [[1994]] $7 </p>
<p>in [[Lebanon]]. But then you are catching individual criminals, not 
states. When your intelligence is rather poor, you [[bomb]] wide areas, 
but not close to the borders of Syria, in spite of the obvious fact 
that without the latter Hizbollah couldn’t move a finger. You also 
take care to spare the Lebanese state machinery as far as possible, 
even though the Hizbollah are represented in the Lebanese 
[[parliament]]”.’ After his observations of [[America]]n Intelligence, 
Bar’el returns to [[Israel]]i Intelligence: “he problem, as indicated 
to me by my intelligence source, is that when political authorities 
choose to put blame for terror on a country according to what under 
given political conditions may be convenient, intelligence work is 
bound to suffer. It is because those authorities then want to find 
“proofs” of what they have already assumed, instead of looking for 
genuine proofs showing who was really responsible for a given 
terrorist outrage.’ </p>
<p>However, in spite of [[Israel]]i military censorship (recently more 
lenient), the Hebrew press has for years been full of pragmatically- 
minded criticism of Mossad and of stories about scandals and 
personal squabbles rampant among its high-ranking staff. This 
criticism became sharper after the last wave of terror revealed 
Mossad’s incompetence. As Bar’el puts it, ‘From the viewpoint of 
the terrorists the first recent assault in Buenos Aires is already the 
second terrorist success. For anti-terrorist struggle agencies, whether 
[[Israel]]i, Argentinian or otherwise, the successes of Argentinian 
terrorism must be particularly embarrassing, because investigations 
of the first assault [the [[bomb]]ing of the [[Israel]]i embassy] failed to 
yield any clue as to the identity of its perpetrators and because 
neither assault was preceded by specific advance indication that it 
was going to occur.’ Similar views were widely echoed in the 
Hebrew press. </p>
<p>Ze’ev Shiff ([[Haaretz]], 5 [[August]]), whose ‘connections’ are in my 
evaluation better than Bar’el’s goes farther in his criticism of 
Mossad, without sparing Military Intelligence either. According to 
him, ‘the latter’s complete failure to penetrate Hizbollah’s ranks 
was not its finest hour. With the exception of whatever could be 
learned through kidnappings, e.g. of Dirani, everything indicates 
that [[Israel]] knows very little about Hizbollah.’ Shiff deplores the fact 
that ‘in the past it was much easier to penetrate the PLO 
organizations in [[Lebanon]] and thus obtain information, than 1s 
now possible to obtain information about Hizbollah, even by way 
of continual observation from distance.’ Still, Shiff views Mossad 
as more incompetent than Military Intelligence, the proof being 
that within the two years which have lapsed since the [[Israel]]i embassy 
in Buenos Aires was [[bomb]]ed ‘Mossad failed to learn anything 
about it.’ In spite of lack of evidence, Shiff assumes that the 
embassy was [[bomb]]ed by ‘funda[[mental]]ists’ who committed the </p>
<p>88 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>recent assault. But he denies that responsibility for these [[bomb]]ings 
can be pinned on any state and he backs this conclusion by a 
finding reached by some unnamed intelligence bodies that explosives 
used in Buenos Aires and London were manufactured from locally 
available raw materials, ‘which means that the explosives were not 
smuggled in by any embassy’. He concludes that ‘[[Israel]] is not in 
a position to claim that the terrorists have been dispatched by a 
single agency. It does not know who are their leaders.’ None the 
less, Shiff says that ‘we need a lot of [[Israel]]i operations of the same 
kind which were used against Palestininian terrorism in the [[1970]]s, 
only superior in quality.’ </p>
<p>In pursuing its anti-[[Iran]]ian campaign, [[Israel]] seems to aim higher 
than a mere Mossad operation. To all appearances, the conditioning 
of the [[Israel]]i public for the peace process is to be followed by an 
[[alliance]] with Saddam Hussein. A curious piece of evidence that 
such an [[alliance]] is in the cards is the complete silence of the 
Hebrew press, which for months already hasn’t uttered a single word 
about the never-ending atrocities occurring in Iraq. ‘The prospect 
of [[alliance]] with Iraq 1s already being mooted by Mossad veterans. 
Shmuel Toledano, a ex-Mossad senior who once served as the Prime 
Minister’s Advisor on Arab Affairs and is active in politics, writes 
in [[Haaretz]] (5 [[August]]) that ‘if [[Israel]] is attacked from the east, the 
Jordanian army will at first try to contain the attack on it, thus giving 
[[Israel]] time to mobilize its forces to encounter the attackers.’ This 
opportunity has, nevertheless, one hitch: ‘Something may yet go 
amiss in the Hashemite kingdom’s interior, giving rise to unwelcome 
developments.’ This is Toledano’s elegant way of alluding to the 
possiblity that the Hashemite dynasty may yet be toppled by a 
popular [[revolution]]. The remedy, as seen by Toledano, of an [[Israel]]i 
peace and [[alliance]] with Iraq, is the best way to protect the 
Hashemites from ‘unwelcome developments’. Although Toledano 
sees them as unwelcome to [[Israel]], they could be no less unwelcome 
to Saddam Hussein. And the strategic value of Iraq to [[Israel]] would 
be no mean consideration either. </p>
<p>‘Toledano is well aware that in the way of making such an [[alliance]] 
‘stands the US which thus far hasn’t been favourably disposed 
toward any state seeking to circumvent the sanctions against Iraq, 
and especially to help Iraq emerge out of its international isolation.’ 
‘But’, says Toledano, ‘[[President]] [[Clinton]] who now badly needs to 
shore up his domestic ratings, will perhaps be able to explain his 
approval of [[Israel]]i—Iraqi [[alliance]] as a step towards advancing peace 
in the Middle East.’ Toledano wants ‘[[Israel]] to obtain from the US 
the entry ticket letting Iraq rejoin the family of the civilized nations’. 
Toledano recalls that ‘Iraq still has accounts to settle with Syria 
for joining the [US-led] coalition during the Gulf [[War]].’ This is why 
‘an Iraqi [[alliance]] with [[Israel]] is going to hurt Syria badly and reduce </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN POLICY - AUGUST [[1994]] 89 </p>
<p>its bargaining power. At the same time let us not forget that Saddam 
Hussein owes a moral debt to Arafat for supporting him fervently 
throughout the Gulf [[War]] and paying a high price for that support. 
Now Arafat wants as many Arab states to make peace with [[Israel]] 
as possible. But he must be particularly interested in making Iraq 
do so, simply because Iraq has been so friendly to him. Besides, 
Iraq may then help him negotiate with [[Israel]]. And the Palestinians 
will then see that Arafat is not isolated.’ For all such reasons, 
Toledano defines the [[alliance]] with Iraq as lying in ‘[[Israel]]’s 
existential interest’. </p>
<p>It is fairly safe to predict the formation of such an [[alliance]], overt 
or covert, in a not very distant future. It can be also fairly safely 
predicted that the [[Clinton]] administration will either overtly support 
or tacitly condone the whole scheme. What I cannot predict is 
whether the envisaged [[Israel]]i world-wide anti-terrorist drive will 
incline the [[Clinton]] administration to support [[Israel]]. Whatever 
happens, however, I find it likely that the peace process with Jordan 
is on [[Israel]]’s part intended as a preliminary step to a violent contest 
with [[Iran]]. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i Policies ‘Toward [[Iran]] and Syria 
1 [[October]] [[1994]] </p>
<p>Here I am going to discuss the continuation and the results of the 
[[Israel]]i anti-[[Iran]]ian campaign described before. I rely primarily on 
Aluf Ben ([[Haaretz]], 28 [[September]]), whose article obviously echoes 
the views of highly-placed sources in the [[Israel]]i establishment, and 
in particular, the Foreign Affairs Ministry, in the way it presents 
the [[Israel]]i anti-[[Iran]]ian policies up to the date of its publication. </p>
<p>It seems impossible to write about [[Israel]]i foreign policy in general, 
and Shimon Peres in particular, without bearing in mind Orwell’s 
Ministry of Truth from his novel [[1984]]. Ben reveals the hitherto 
unknown fact that under Peres the [[Israel]]i Foreign Ministry has had 
a ‘Peace in the Middle East Department’. Right after the Buenos 
Aires terror assault ‘Peres appointed the deputy-director, of this 
department, Yo’av Biran as a coordinator of [[Israel]]i measures 
against [[Iran]]’, writes Ben, because ‘[[Israel]] instantly perceived this 
assault as a convenient opportunity’ to form an anti-[[Iran]]ian 
coalition. The fact that [[Israel]]i Intelligence has failed to establish 
any link between [[Iran]] and that terror assault, was of course no 
obstacle in this “convenient opportunity’. But one may ask a deeper 
question here: why do terrorist assaults have a tendency to occur 
exactly when their occurrence is for [[Israel]] a ‘convenient 
opportunity’? Leaving this issue aside for the time being, let me 
quote Ben who invokes ‘top-ranking [[[Israel]]i] politician’ (possibly 
Peres) as one who ‘several days earlier briefed the more notable 
Jerusalem political correspondents’ about the results of a world- 
wide campaign against [[Iran]]. </p>
<p>The campaign was to follow Rabin’s strategy and Peres’ tactics 
and to be carried out by Biran in ‘Peace in the Middle East 
Department’. Rabin and Peres agree that ‘[[Iran]] is the greatest risk 
[[Israel]] has ever faced and a major threat to the stability of the entire 
Middle East.’ This is due not only to ‘its support for terror and 
sabotage and its attempt to become [[nuclear]]ized’, but to its ‘being 
an examplar not only for Islamic funda[[mental]]ists but for other 
resistance movements in Arab countries’. Judging from my 
familiarity with what goes under the name of [[Israel]]i strategic 
thinking, the reference to ‘resistance movements’ means that many </p>
<p>90 </p>
<p>ISRAELI POLICIES TOWARD IRAN AND SYRIA 91 </p>
<p>Middle [[Eastern]]ers (not necessarily Arabs) take pride in the fact that 
[[Iran]] has not succumbed to [[America]]n diktat for nearly twenty 
years. This proves to them that resistance to US policy schemes 
in the Middle East is possible and conflicts with [[Israel]]i attempts 
‘to convince’ everyone concerned that resisting the US is an exercise 
in futility; and that, since [[Israel]] has US support, resisting [[Israel]] is 
futile as well. [[Iran]] provides the best evidence to the contrary. </p>
<p>Rabin’s strategy was ‘to push the US and other western powers 
into a confrontation with [[Iran]]’ because if ‘[[Israel]] confronts [[Iran]] on 
its own, it may get involved in a religious war against the entire 
Muslim world’. To forestall this danger ‘[[Israel]]i propaganda 
{Hasbara] was ordered to depict the rulers of [[Iran]] as “a danger to 
peace in the entire world and a threat to equilibrium between 
[[Western]] civilization and Islam”’.’ Peres exerted himself towards this 
aim by ‘sending his personal [[representative]]s to capitals of states in 
the world at large, in order to first announce that [[Israel]] and Jordan 
had reached an agreement and right thereafter to demand that the 
state concerned should stop giving credits to [[Iran]] and radically 
reduce the volume of [[trade]] with it, until it ceases supporting 
terrorism and gives up attempts to [[nuclear]]ize’. Peres’ representa- 
tives were also instructed to say that [[Israel]] was highly critical of 
any state willing to reschedule [[Iran]]ian debts. The chief offender 
in [[Israel]]’s eyes was Germany ‘which the was first to sign with [[Iran]] 
a debt-rescheduling accord’, but Japan, [[France]], [[Italy]], Switzerland 
and [[South]] [[[[Korea]]]] were by no means blameless in [[Israel]]i eyes either. </p>
<p>Let me omit Ben’s reports about the course of this campaign, 
except to report on the behaviour of [[Iran]]ian diplomats attending 
international conferences who, to [[Israel]]i regret, didn’t behave in 
conformity with expectations. The [[Israel]]i diplomats had instructions 
to accuse [[Iran]] of ‘under[[mining]] the peace process’, expecting 
[[Iran]]ians ‘either to leave the hall during our speeches or else to 
corroborate our allegations by admitting that they indeed opposed 
the peace process’. Instead, the [[Iran]]ian diplomats used to listen to 
[[Israel]]i [[representative]]s’ accusations and then take the podium to 
argue that the word ‘peace’ has plural meanings. If by using that 
word [[Israel]] means to withdraw from all territories [[conquer]]ed since 
[[June]] [[1967]] including East Jerusalem and [[South]] [[Lebanon]], [[Iran]] will 
by no means oppose it. The [[Israel]]i diplomats couldn’t but refuse 
to answer the [[Iran]]ians straight. Instead, they quoted some 
admittedly provocative interviews [[Iran]]ian politicians had previously 
given to the western press. That was answered by an assertion that 
the interviewers ‘didn’t understand what they had been told’ and 
by reiterating the request to discuss the peace that could be brought 
to fruition by a total [[Israel]]i withdrawal. </p>
<p>This sequence of failures couldn’t but result in a bifurcation of 
expert opinion. As Ben reports, two policies are now being </p>
<p>92 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>recommended to Rabin. The first is that ‘since we haven’t succeeded 
in isolating the [[Iran]]ians, we need to begin to talk straight to them ... 
Other major figures, however, have urged Rabin to go ahead 
without bothering about [[America]]n protection and adopt an activist 
policy against [[Iran]], relying on [[Israel]]’s own resources alone.’ It is 
impossible yet to make predictions on which way Rabin may 
ultimately follow. </p>
<p>I believe the most important single factor now prompting [[Israel]] 
to make an effort to reach accommodation with Syria is the much 
increased military power of the Syrian Army. The most important 
recent article dealing with the Syrian army was by Ron Ben-Yishay, 
an author reputed for his good access to the [[Israel]]i Army high 
command. According to Ben-Yishay (Yediot Ahronot, 16 
[[September]]), ‘[[Assad]] is very close to realizing his old dream of 
reaching a strategic parity with [[Israel]].’ Ben-Yishay explains that 
‘during the long years when the USSR and its satellites supported 
Syria, the latter couldn’t really advance toward a strategic parity 
with [[Israel]].’ Although Ben-Yishay does not explain why it was so, 
I would venture a guess that the USSR’s Middle East policies had 
been for a long time secretly coordinated with the US. Things 
changed under Gorbachev, who, according to Ben-Yishay, ‘soon 
after assuming power told [[Assad]] that he expected him to make peace 
with [[Israel]], even on [[Israel]]i terms. To make it clear that he meant 
business, Gorbachev stopped [[Soviet]] arms sales to Syria. For some 
time he did allow the supplies of limited quantities of spare parts, 
but eventually even such sales were stopped.’ Ben-Yishay’s 
information seems to me to be accurate. Probably because he 
believed in unlimited [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence within the US, Gorbachev’s 
policies were pro-[[Israel]]i: ‘For a different reason those policies were 
pursued after the collapse of the [[Soviet]] Union in [[1991]]. The new 
rulers of [[Russia]] refused to sell any weapons to Syria except for hard 
currency which Syria then hardly possessed.’ Ben-Yishay defines 
the years [[1986]]-91 as the Syrian Army’s most unfortunate period. 
During the Gulf Crisis ‘US officers expressed highly critical opinions 
about the quality of Syrian troops.’ This applied not only to the 
division the Syrians dispatched to [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] but also to any other 
troops the [[America]]ns had chance to inspect. </p>
<p>According to Ben-Yishay, the growth of the Syrian Army’s power 
dates from the aftermath of the Gulf Crisis. The first contribution 
to it was by the US ‘which secretely allocated the best among the 
captured Iraqi tanks and self-propelled guns to Syrian forces as a 
reward for their participation in the anti-Iraq coalition’. After 
having declared Syria a ‘terror-state’ the US couldn’t legally disburse 
any credits to Syria. But it convinced some unnamed [[Europe]]an 
countries to grant Syria ‘several hundred million dollars in credit’ 
after the Gulf [[War]] was over. ‘At the same time Syria received a </p>
<p>ISRAELI POLICIES TOWARD IRAN AND SYRIA 93 </p>
<p>grant of $1.5 billion directly from the [[Saudi]] royal house.’ Such grants 
seem to continue to flow. Aluf Ben ([[Haaretz]], 12 [[August]]) says that 
‘Peres complained to his US colleague [[War]]ren Christopher about 
the [[Saudi]]s.’ His complaint must have had little effect, though, since 
Ben says that ‘[[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] is the only state in the region whose 
direct ties with [[Washington]] are not pre-consulted with [[Israel]]. It is 
the only state which, unlike [[Egypt]], Jordan, Syria and the PLO, does 
not need to cope with constant US pressures to be more open toward 
[[Israel]] and accept basic [[Israel]]i demands.’ This statement should not 
be construed as meaning that the US had refrained from exerting 
any pressure on [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]], but that the exerted pressures 
concerned matters of secondary importance. Ben-Yishay believes 
that [[Saudi]] financial aid to Syria keeps flowing with the effect that 
[[Assad]] has plenty of hard cash to buy the best weaponry. 
Undoubtedly the present equipment of the Syrian Army is much 
better than it was when Syria depended on [[Soviet]] supplies. Contrary 
to conventional wisdom, the collapse of the USSR does not seem 
to have weakened Syria; and I would venture the same guess about 
any Arab state. It might well have been a blessing for them all. 
Let me omit Ben-Yishay’s elaborate presentation of the current 
size of the Syrian ground forces and their weapons. The point worth 
mentioning, however, is his view that the Syrians must have what 
he calls ‘non-conventional weapons’, namely quite accurate land- 
to-land [[missile]]s which can be equipped with chemical warheads. 
I concur with this view. Against these [[missile]]s [[Israel]]i is in Ben- 
Yishay’s view defenceless. They can wreak havoc across the country. 
According to him, the acquisition of these weapons by Syria and 
the [[Saudi]] funding of these purchases was attributable to their 
shared fear that ‘[[Israel]] might attempt to impose on Syria a peace 
on [[Israel]]i terms, exactly as [[Israel]] had attempted to do during the 
Lebanese [[War]].’ Such an attempt could follow an offensive of ‘the 
[[Israel]]i Army breaking through the Golan Heights cease-fire lines, 
with the effect of arriving on the outskirts of Damascus after no 
more than 24 hours’. In Ben-Yishay’s view [[Israel]] had this option 
until a few years ago: ‘Right now, however, Syrian armour 1s 
capable of stopping an [[Israel]]i attack simultaneously on two fronts, 
in the Golan Heights and in [[Lebanon]]. However, if the [[Israel]]i Air 
Force attacks Syria now, as it did in [[October]] [[1973]], in order to 
destroy half of Syrian military and civilian infrastructure, [[Assad]] 
would be able to retaliate, wreaking upon [[Israel]] a no lesser amount 
of devastation’, something he could not do in [[1973]]. Ben-Yishay 
maintains that ‘[[Israel]] still retains its qualitative advantage in terms 
of both the quality of its weapons and the training of its military 
personnel.’ Yet he concludes that ‘for the first time in Middle 
[[Eastern]] [[history]] a situation has appeared, where a state, namely Syria, 
is capable of defending itself effectively against [[Israel]]i attack. For </p>
<p>94 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[Assad]] it could well have been a reason inducing him to open 
negotiations with [[Israel]], because he had kept saying that he would 
proceed to truly decisive negotiations with [[Israel]] only from a 
position of strength.’ </p>
<p>Ben-Yishay refers to fears of Syrian strength present ‘among 
security professionals in [[Israel]], including the Commander of 
[[North]]ern Command’, General Yitzhak Mordechay, known for his 
hawkish views. Right-wing politicians and Golan Heights settlers 
believe that it is [[Assad]] who wants to attack [[Israel]]. Ben-Yishay, 
however, is adamant that ‘many in the high command of the [[Israel]]i 
Army and all of [[Israel]]i Intelligence are convinced that Syria is 
doing exactly what [[Israel]] is doing. Like Syria, [[Israel]] conducts bona 
fide peace negotiations while arming itself to the teeth in the event 
that they fail, the status quo gets stalemated and a war breaks out. 
Although only time can tell which of the two sides 1s right in its 
evaluations, all the signs indicate that [[Assad]] wants an honourable 
peace’. This evaluation is backed by Professor Moshe Ma’oz, an 
orientalist with close access to the [[Israel]]i Security System. He says 
that ‘although Syria keeps arming itself with weapons which can 
be lethal for us, its claim that the purpose of these armaments is 
defensive is eminently credible. After all, Syria does need to deter 
Iraq. Its need to deter [[Israel]] is much greater. It needs to avoid a 
repeat of the [[1982]] invasion of [[Lebanon]] and to conduct negotiations 
from a position of strength. Rightly so, [[Israel]] 1s doing exactly the 
same while buttressing its military and strategic standing so as to 
negotiate simultaneously from a position of strength.’ (Yeduiot 
Ahronot, 28 [[September]]) </p>
<p>Ma’oz adds that [[Israel]]i military strength derives partly from the 
US supplies of modern weaponry deliberately intended ‘to provide 
[[Israel]] with superiority over all neighbouring Arab states together’. 
According to him, the US has pursued this objective ‘since the early 
[[1960]]s’, that is, since the term of office of John F. [[Kennedy]]. I think 
Ma’oz is right. [[Kennedy]] reversed the approach toward [[Israel]] 
adopted by Eisenhower. In my view, the Six Day [[War]] was a direct 
consequence of [[Kennedy]]-initiated policies. But Ma’oz is aware that 
[[America]]n support for [[Israel]] is in turn conditional on [[Israel]]’s 
willingness to coordinate its policies with the US: ‘Once [[Israel]] gives 
away the Golan Heights to Syria, the US, as it already promised, 
will Keep supplying the [[Israel]]i Army with the most sophisticated 
modern weaponry in abundance, so that the [[Israel]]i Army may 
retain its strategic superiority over the entire Middle East even in 
peacetime.’ Although neither Ben-Yishay nor Ma’oz say it explicitly, 
they can be understood as arguing against the demand of the 
[[Israel]]i nght-wing (including Labor Party hawks) to stop negotiating 
with Syria for as long as Syria keeps purchasing weaponry. Politicians 
and publicists voicing this demand (among whom the most </p>
<p>ISRAELI POLICIES TOWARD IRAN AND SYRIA op </p>
<p>vociferous is the Likud leader Netanyahu), believe that while Syria 
must be prevented from purchasing weapons, [[Israel]] must keep 
arming itself. </p>
<p>Amir Oren, writing in Davar (30 [[September]]), agrees with Ben- 
Yishay that until [[1991]] the [[America]]ns, regardless of what they 
would officially declare, didn’t want [[Israel]] to withdraw from the 
Golan Heights. The Syrian participation in the [[1990]]-91 anti-Iraqi 
coalition changed [[America]]n attitudes. Oren discusses [[Israel]]i 
relations with Syria against the background of steady reduction of 
the US Defence budgets. Ma’oz, Ben-Yishay and other [[Israel]]i 
commentators assume that the US may generously reward [[Israel]] 
for any accord with Syria with grants to be used for the purchase 
of quality weapons for the [[Israel]]i Army. On the opposite side 
stands Oren, who believes that while the budgets of the US Marines 
are being cut, it may be difficult to persuade [[Congress]] to grant [[Israel]] 
the huge sums which it has hoped for. According to Oren, US money 
may be particularly needed if the peace process fails: ‘One [[Israel]]i 
Army general recently requested to speak to Rabin and Chief of 
Staff Barak at least six times. His aim was to alert them to the gap 
between estimates of the equipment needed for the coming war 
and the equipment likely to be actually lost in such an event.’ 
Oren blames Rabin for this state of affairs. As both Prime Minister 
and Defence Minister, Rabin in Oren’s eyes is not able to cut 
civilian budgets enough to allocate more money for the Army. Yet 
according to official figures over one half of the [[Israel]]i Army’s budget 
goes for salaries and pensions. More weapons means more personnel 
to look after them, even when they are safely stored. In any event, 
therefore, more weapons means the further militarization of [[Israel]]i 
society. In Barak’s view as reported by Oren ‘the gap against which 
the mentioned general warned does exist but [[Israel]] will have time 
to bridge it. Stopping negotiations with Syria would create a 
strategic alert. Months before Syria opens fire in a form of static 
shelling, let alone in an attack, the US can be expected to open its 
weaponry stores to the [[Israel]]i Army and let it pick up whatever 
it wants.’ </p>
<p>Oren reports this optimistic expectation, but does not share it. 
He admits that ‘[[Clinton]] loves [[Israel]] effusively and even more the 
[[America]]n voters who support [[Israel]].’ But he warns that ‘[[Clinton]] 
becomes ever weaker as [[President]], to the point that his wishes are 
being less and less taken into account.’ Also, the power of the 
organized US Jews is in Oren’s view declining. This is why Oren 
anticipates that ‘in [[1994]]-97 no responsible [[Israel]]i Prime Minister 
and Defence Minister can rest at ease that [[Assad]] would suffer rebuffs 
passively; nor expect that the [[Israel]]i Army would win a quick, easy 
and cheap victory; nor hope for a war in which [[Israel]] could 
accomplish more than without fighting it. It would be like in </p>
<p>96 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[October]] [[1973]] when we lost 2,600 fallen for what we could 
approximately accomplish without a single [[Israel]]i casualty.’ Oren 
uses this argument also against ‘the opponents of the withdrawal 
from the Golan Heights’ who really want a war with Syria, so as 
to let ‘the [[Israel]]i Army take advantage of its deployment on the 
Golan Heights and win a quick victory. This assumption, however, 
ignores such factors as the loss of morale of the civilians in the rear 
and of the troops on the front as soon as they realize that the war 
they fight is unnecessary. It also ignores the fact that the [[Israel]]i Army 
cannot fight a protracted war without having its indispensable 
supplies constantly renewed.’ </p>
<p>In summary, the new factor in [[Israel]]i—Syrian relations is the 
military parity set between them. This factor puts [[Israel]] much 
more at a disadvantage than was the case two years ago. [[Israel]]i 
military and intelligence leadership, foolish as ever, was not aware 
of the build-up of Syrian strategic strength until it was too late. Of 
course, now it 1s aware of that, even if only due to [[America]]n 
briefings. As a consequence, [[Israel]] is now for the first time prepared 
to negotiate a deal with Syria. I don’t know yet what [[Israel]] is really 
ready to offer Syria. In view of the lack of information I am not 
going either to try to guess what [[Israel]] may yet demand from Syria. 
With two exceptions, though. First, it is certain that [[Israel]] will 
demand that Syria itself disarms the Hizbollah. And second, it is 
also certain that [[Israel]] will demand Syrian backing for, or at least 
neutrality in, the coming [[Israel]]i contest with [[Iran]], no matter what 
forms this contest may yet assume. </p>
<p>Part III </p>
<p>ISRAELI FOREIGN TRADE </p>
<p>Trade Between [[Israel]] and the Arab [[States]] 
26 [[April]] [[1991]] </p>
<p>Officially, all Arab states (except [[Egypt]] since signing the peace 
[[treaty]]) have been boycotting [[Israel]] since [[1949]]. The boycott assumes 
two forms. On the one hand, all [[trade]], all postal deliveries and all 
travel exchanges between [[Israel]] and any Arab state are supposed 
to be banned. On the other hand, the Arab states are also supposed 
to boycott commercial [[companies]] from third countries which do 
any [[trade]] with [[Israel]]. Even the films shown in [[Israel]] in theory cannot 
be seen in Arab countries. An overseeing ‘Boycott Office’, located 
in Damascus, is supposed to impose specific bans and to issue 
guidelines binding all the Arab states. </p>
<p>In reality some Arab states for all practical intents and purposes 
stopped boycotting [[Israel]] in [[1967]], right after the Six Day [[War]], and 
started pursuing diversified [[trade]] and other relations with [[Israel]]. 
This has continued since, to the point of becoming an important 
prop for the [[Israel]]i economy. In the beginning, [[Israel]]i censorship 
saw to it that the subject was never explicitly mentioned in the media. 
Nevertheless, knowledge of the situation became widespread in 
[[Israel]]. As for the Arab countries, articles and press reports obviously 
inspired by the authorities have kept appearing, asserting the 
boycott’s success. (The Palestinian press in particular has done its 
best to maintain this illusion.) As time lapsed, however, some 
oblique (and occasionally even direct) references to the [[Israel]]i 
[[trade]] with Arab states were tacitly allowed to appear in the 
Hebrew press. </p>
<p>The first extensive discussion of the situation, authored by Yosef 
Ein-Dor appeared, however, only most recently in Al-Hamishmar 
(20 [[March]] [[1991]]). To a great extent Ein-Dor relies on lectures 
delivered by Professor Gad Gilber, described as ‘an expert in the 
Middle [[Eastern]] economy’, at Tel Aviv University’s Dayan Centre 
of Strategic Studies. The publication of Ein-Dor’s article may be 
connected with [[Israel]]’s present demand for the formal termination 
of the boycott and institution of overt [[trade]] relations as a 
precondition for peace with pro-[[America]]n Arab countries. While 
drawing on his article, I will also use other available information, 
including various Hebrew press titbits which have kept appearing </p>
<p>99 </p>
<p>100 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>over the years. Incidentally, such titbits began to crop up in [[June]] 
[[1982]], at the time of the invasion of [[Lebanon]]. It could hardly be 
coincidental that the invasion was, iter alia, intended to promote 
[[Israel]]i exports to the Arab world. I will also use private sources of 
information, albeit, like the aforementioned titbits, without specific 
references. </p>
<p>Let me begin with the second form of boycott, that is, the boycott 
of [[companies]] trading with [[Israel]]. With a few exceptions involving 
[[Japanese]] [[companies]], this boycott had already become economically 
meaningless in the late [[1950]]s. Professor Gilber states that ‘in the 
early [[1960]]s, both the central Boycott Office located in Damascus 
and its coordinating branch offices admitted [in their yearly reports] 
that their venture had turned into an unprecedented fiasco ... An 
increasing number of foreign [[companies]], which had once feared 
retaliation on the part of the Boycott Office, started ignoring it. 
Moreover, even the Arab states from then on began to cooperate 
with that office rather perfunctorily, often turning a blind eye to a 
given [[company]]’s connections with [[Israel]].’ The boycott’s abject 
failure was further accelerated by the formation of ‘branch or 
dummy [[companies]], registered in the US or other countries’ for the 
sole purpose of doing business with [[Israel]]. The fierce opposition 
of the US to this form of boycott, highlighted by enactment of 
legislation against it, brought the whole venture to the point of 
collapse, especially since other countries resisted it as well. Although 
Ein-Dor does not say it, the corruption of Arab bureaucracies, the 
demand of the Arab public for the goods the boycotted [[companies]] 
could offer cheaply and profits the Arab merchants could reap from 
the sales of such goods did the rest. Whatever boycott continued 
was focused on the most visible and publicity-liable [[trade]] sectors: 
for example, high fashion or renowned movie stars, and the like. 
Scattered instances of such token boycotts, intended for their 
propaganda effects only, may continue to this very day. Everything 
else was moribund already before [[1967]], although unknown to 
both the Arab and the Jewish publics. As an economic factor of 
any significance, the whole subject can now be safely ignored. </p>
<p>This, however, was not the case with the more important form 
of direct Arab boycott of [[Israel]] which at least until [[June]] [[1967]] was 
observed quite rigorously. Both in [[Israel]] and in the Arab countries 
this form of boycott was often referred to as ‘the wall’ surrounding 
[[Israel]] from all sides except the sea. Its existence was by all means 
a major factor in [[Israel]]i policies. But, as Professor Gilber correctly 
observes, ‘the first crack in the wall of the Arab boycott appeared 
as a result of the occupation of the West Bank in [[1967]] when 
[[Israel]]i-produced goods started flooding the Arab market, contrary 
to the boycott’s foremost purpose.’ As a result of this, ‘the wall 
became a sieve.’ Almost at once ‘the [[Territories]] began to function </p>
<p>TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB STATES 101 </p>
<p>as a transit point in export of [[Israel]]i goods to Arab states east of 
Jordan’, but not to Jordan itself. During [[1968]]-72, the Jordanian 
authorities, in cooperation with the Boycott Office in Damascus 
and its Amman branch, issued pathetic appeals to the chambers 
of commerce in the West Bank which then operated under the [[Israel]]i 
rule and were comprised of the [[Israel]]i appointees, to halt this [[trade]] 
by insisting on attaching a label ‘made in West Bank’ or ‘made in 
Gaza Strip’ to the goods passing the Jordanian territory in transit 
further east. (Subsequently, the label had to specify the name of 
an ‘Arab’ factory supposedly manufacturing a given product.) 
[[Israel]]i authorities readily consented. The ‘factories’, usually owned 
by the rich chambers of commerce members were quickly set up, 
to do nothing apart from putting new labels on [[Israel]]i manufactures. 
The PLO which at that time was a power in Jordan, acceded 
(apparently for a share in the profits) to this all-too-transparent 
scheme without saying a word about it in public, while repeating 
ad nauseam its then prevalent slogan of ‘strangling [[Israel]]’ by the 
‘united Arab boycott’. </p>
<p>While Jordan allows transit of [[Israel]]i exports to other Arab 
countries, it has instituted tight and quite effectual controls to 
protect its own markets. Since [[1975]] the volume of these exports 
declined, compared to what it was in [[1967]]-75. Consider, for 
example, the following Hebrew press story. In [[1986]], after the US 
State Secretary Shultz made some rhetoric about ‘improving the 
quality of life in the Occupied [[Territories]]’, some naive [[America]]n 
Palestinians responded with a project of opening a cement factory 
in the West Bank. [[Israel]]i authorities consented, but on a strict 
condition that all cement produced was to go for export to Arab 
countries via Jordan, with none to be marketed in the [[Territories]] 
themselves so as not to undermine the monopoly of the [[Israel]]i- 
produced cement in the local market. The prospective investors 
rejected this condition. But they again raised the matter in [[March]] 
[[1991]], knowing that [[Israel]] still stood by its condition. Now, however, 
the Hebrew press reported how [[Israel]]i policy in the [[Territories]] 
changed under Arens. Contrary to Rabin who turned down 
Palestinian applications to open a new businesses, Arens tends to 
grant them, on condition that a given business will also relabel 
[[Israel]]i-made goods destined for export through Jordan. </p>
<p>The implication of the story is, that from the [[Israel]]i point of view, 
the described exports have always had a major disadvantage. They 
depended on Jordanian consent. Being a sovereign state, Jordan 
ls in a position to impose conditions. The fictitious labels are one 
such condition. The matter is no more than symbolic. Other 
conditions, such as the closure of the Jordanian market to [[Israel]]i 
exports are economically detri[[mental]]. </p>
<p>2 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>This is why [[Israel]] has been looking for other outlets for its 
exports, that could be under its exclusive control. Professor Gilber 
speaks about it not without a certain finesse: ‘In [[1975]], after the 
direct ties with [[South]] [[Lebanon]] expanded, another route was 
opened for transit of [[Israel]]i exports to Arab markets, first and 
foremost in [[Lebanon]] itself, but also in Syria. [[Israel]]i trucks with fruit 
and vegetables, processed foodstuffs, household appliances and 
other [[Israel]]i manufactures, would arrive at the [Lebanese border] 
checkpost in Rosh Hanikra, where the goods would be reloaded 
on to Arab trucks which would then proceed to Syria and [[Lebanon]]. 
Every Syrian and Lebanese knew that the goods were [[Israel]]i, but 
as long as the “Made in [[Israel]]” label was absent, nobody cared’, 
Damascus Boycott Office included. The new transit via [[Lebanon]] 
has differed from the transit via Jordan in two respects. One is of 
a rather symbolic nature: there has been no need to relabel anything, 
as the sheer absence of an [[Israel]]i label did the trick. But the other 
difference was material. Since [[Israel]] controlled both sides of Rosh 
Hanikra checkpost, the reloading did not need to be coordinated 
with authorities of another state, as it did on the Jordan River 
bridges. The PLO which in [[1975]]-82 in southern [[Lebanon]] had even 
more power than before [[1970]] in Jordan, again could not be bothered 
with a subject as trivial as [[trade]]. </p>
<p>Economic motivations behind the unpublicized occupation of 
parts of southern [[Lebanon]] from [[1975]] onward were never mentioned 
abroad, but known at the time to many in [[Israel]], myself included. 
(It was, incidentally, Shimon Peres, who first had the gall to disguise 
the sordid realities of that occupation under the name of ‘the good- 
neighbourly fence’.) Later, pretty much the same economic reasons 
were a factor in the full-scale [[1982]] invasion of that country, in the 
continuing occupation of its large areas in [[1982]]-85, and finally in 
the occupation of the so-called ‘Security Zone’ up to the present day. </p>
<p>Professor Gilber says that ‘[[Israel]]i exporters operated under 
strong incentives to seek alternative markets ... after losing the 
[[Iran]]ian market for [[Israel]]i exports when the Shah had been 
overthrown.’ This explains the [[Israel]]i expansion into [[Lebanon]] to 
a certain extent. During the heyday of the invasion in [[June]]-[[July]] 
[[1982]], the Labor hawk Haggay Eshed (a friend of Sharon) published 
articles in Davar explaining that the ‘commercial hegemony’ over 
the Middle East was to be won ‘by the two trading nations, the 
Jews and the Maronites’. (The latter won this distinction by virtue 
of their purported descent from the Phoenicians.) Eshed was 
emphatic in defining the search for such ‘hegemony’ as an aim of 
the invasion and conquest of [[Lebanon]]. But it soon turned out that 
Bashir Jumail had other ideas. After having been elected president 
of [[Lebanon]] he met Begin in Nahariya where, without objecting to 
[[Israel]]i military presence in his country he demanded an immediate </p>
<p>TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB STATES _ 103 </p>
<p>restoration of Lebanese customs controls on its border with [[Israel]]. 
The demand made Begin angry and he refused to comply with it. 
I have a hunch which I admittedly cannot substantiate, that the 
[[assassination]] of Jumail which occurred shortly thereafter was not 
entirely unconnected with this dispute with Begin over customs 
control. </p>
<p>No conceivable Lebanese [[government]], of whatever political 
stripe, can possibly put up with [[Israel]]i economic penetration of 
[[Lebanon]], even if out of weakness or other reasons it would tolerate 
[[Israel]]i military presence on its territory. It is because this penetration 
amounts to something without parallels in modern [[history]]. A great 
deal of [[Israel]]i exports are marketed in [[Lebanon]] without passing 
through any customs or border controls. Only the exports which 
pass [[Lebanon]] 1n transit to Syria are subject to controls on the Syrian 
border. Another abnormality is in the modes of marketing. In the 
areas of [[Lebanon]] which are, or were, overtly or covertly occupied 
by [[Israel]], [[Israel]]i goods have been sold as such, without fictitious 
labels or other disguises. In the rest of [[Lebanon]] and in other Arab 
countries they are being sold, as Professor Gilber informs, through 
‘the medium of dummy corporations established in Cyprus, [[Greece]] 
and [[Spain]] for the sole purpose of disguising the fact of their being 
[[Israel]]i manufactures’. </p>
<p>According to Gilber, the volume of direct [[trade]] between [[Israel]] 
and Arab countries carried out in this way has lately considerably 
increased. He does not provide updated statistical figures; he only 
says that ‘in the early [[1980]]s the value of [[[Israel]]i] exports to Arab 
countries, including the Occupied [[Territories]], amounted to about 
$500,000.’ In my opinion, this estimate must be interpreted as 
referring only to exports passing through the Occupied [[Territories]] 
and then through Jordan. I cannot reveal the source of my own 
estimate, which is that in [[1988]]-89 [[Israel]]i exports to all Arab states, 
except the Occupied [[Territories]] and [[Egypt]] (in the latter case the 
official figures are available) were in the range between $1.5 billion 
and perhaps as high as $2 billion. Even this estimate does not cover 
arms and other security-related products about which I have no 
detailed information, but whose value has been far from negligible. 
A notice recently published in the Hebrew press in connection with 
the current scandal involving the defective quality of gas masks the 
[[Israel]]i [[government]] distributed to its citizenry during the Gulf [[War]], 
sheds some light on this sector of [[Israel]]i exports. As it turns out, 
some gas masks found defective had Arabic language labels on them. 
Why? Because they were sold by [[Israel]] to Germany but, shortly 
after the Gulf crisis began, they were hastily repurchased back. Why 
should [[Israel]] sell gas masks with Arab language labels to Germany 
which anyhow produces enough gas masks on its own, if not for 
the sake of thus transiting them to an Arab state? But apart from </p>
<p>104 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>gas masks, reliable reports give information about [[Israel]]i mortars 
and other military equipment destined for Morocco, [[Oman]], 
Lebanese militias and, one can presume, other Arab countries 
as well. </p>
<p>In order to show the relative value of [[trade]] with Arab countries 
for [[Israel]], let me use official data for the year [[1988]] as published in 
The Statistical Abstract of [[Israel]], [[1989]]. Except for [[Egypt]], the volume 
contains no particularized data about exports to the Arab countries 
(even to [[Lebanon]]); only the totals which may or may not cover those 
exports. The only open information available is from Professor 
Gilber who says, without referring to his sources or providing 
breakdowns for particular countries, that ‘the total value of all 
exports to Arab states (including [[Egypt]] and [[North]] [[Africa]]) for [[1988]] 
amounted to about $1 billion.’ I think that this is a gross 
underestimate. According to the Statistical Abstract just referred 
to, all [[Israel]]i exports taken together in [[1988]] totalled $9.739 million, 
thereof to the [[Europe]]an Common Market countries $3.229 million 
and to the US $2.987 million. Since [[Israel]]i exports to other 
countries were small and to [[Egypt]] miniscule, a considerable part 
of the remainder can only be accounted for by exports to other Arab 
states. Gilber does say that the ‘hidden’ [[Israel]]i exports to Arab states 
amounted to about 10 per cent of total exports. This would accord 
with his $1 billion estimate. But for the reason just stated, I would 
think that the actual figure is at least twice as high, or even higher. </p>
<p>More information can be extracted from Gilber about the nature 
and dynamics of [[Israel]]i exports to Arab countries. He bewails 
what for him is a paradox, that the Arab country with which [[Israel]] 
is at peace, [[Egypt]], has successfully barred nearly all [[Israel]]i exports 
while selling to [[Israel]] oil for hard cash. This he contrasts with 
countries of destination which do not have peaceful relations with 
[[Israel]], such as ‘all the Gulf states’. He discusses the diversification 
of [[Israel]]i exports to the Arab countries, which include ‘fresh and 
frozen fruits and vegetables, processed foodstuffs, textiles, office 
supplies, domestic solar heaters, furniture, cosmetics, medication, 
fertilizers, electronic equipment such as communication units, air 
conditioners, spare parts for cars including tyres, agricultural 
equipment such as drip-irrigation pipes, pesticides, fertilizers and 
all kind of raw materials’, apparently including many chemicals. 
He correctly observes that some of the listed products, being 
originally designed for the climatic and soil conditions of [[Israel]], 
are better suited to similar conditions in Arab countries than the 
comparable [[Europe]]an or [[America]]n manufactures, in addition to 
being cheaper. For instance, [[Israel]]i agricultural drip-irrigation 
equipment, which is world-renowned, aroused the special interest 
of Arabs, to the point that ‘in [[March]] [[1990]], when an agricultural 
exhibition was held in Tel Aviv ... several buyers from hostile Arab </p>
<p>TRADE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE ARAB STATES 105 </p>
<p>states were permitted to attend’. The proximity of [[Israel]] to Arab 
countries also works, as Gilber observes, to [[Israel]]’s competitive 
advantage over [[Europe]]an and other exporters, especially ‘in the case 
of large-sized merchandise’ whose transport 1s expensive. </p>
<p>In conclusion, let me point to various implications of the described 
[[trade]] practices, and of the relations between [[Israel]] and the Arab 
states in general, in terms of the actual political situation and the 
potentialities inherent in it. A very important question which Gilber 
does not ask, is: how do the Arab states pay for their [[Israel]]i exports? 
It can be stated with confidence that the bulk of civilian exports 
as listed, until the Gulf crisis (which disrupted [[trade]] routes) were 
destined for [[Lebanon]], Syria, Iraq, Sudan, [[Libya]], [[Oman]] and other 
Gulf states with the exception of [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]]. Only in the case of 
[[Lebanon]] a guid pro quo is known: illicit [[drugs]], although sold to [[Israel]] 
in increasing quantities, can hardly amount to more than a fraction 
of [[Israel]]i exports to that country. All other listed Arab states export 
nothing to [[Israel]]. Hence an inescapable conclusion, supported by 
quite extensive evidence available to me privately, that [[Israel]]i 
exports are paid for in hard currencies and occasionally in [[gold]]. I 
have no information about the breakdown of the distribution of 
[[Israel]]i exports to each named Arab state, but I know that Iraq and 
Syria are now on the top of the list, while exports to [[Libya]] (Gaddafi’s 
frequent anti-[[Israel]] posturing notwithstanding) are not negligible. 
An interesting fact emerges: beyond the screen of incessant 
sloganeering about their unshakable commitment to Palestinian 
cause and to ‘the armed struggle’ against [[Israel]] the three ‘radical’ 
Arab dictators, Gaddafi, [[Assad]] and Saddam Hussein, have for 
long years been supplying [[Israel]] with much of its foreign currency 
reserves. And it can be assumed that, in the absence of publicity, 
they will continue to do so in the future as well. </p>
<p>A generalization is called for here. With the exception of some 
minor states such as Yemen, Mauritania or even [[Algeria]] (whose case 
will yet be discussed), the more an Arab state is or pretends to be 
hostile towards [[Israel]], the higher are its purchases of [[Israel]]i-made 
goods and the closer are its covert relations with [[Israel]]. ‘The reverse 
also holds true. The two most moderate Arab states, [[Egypt]] and 
Jordan, have been the only ones which actually barred nearly all 
[[Israel]]i exports. Among the states which buy big quantities of [[Israel]]i- 
made goods are not only Syria and (until the Gulf crisis) Iraq but 
the Gulf states which do not even permit [[Israel]] to be shown on the 
maps sold on their territory. Although the [[Israel]]i exports to [[Libya]] 
are not as massive as those to Iraq and Syria it is by no means 
irrelevant that much of [[Libya]]n oil is marketed by the ‘Occidental 
Petroleum’ [[company]] owned (until his recent [[death]]) by the notorious 
Zionist, Armand Hammer, who was in[[flu]]ential in convincing the 
USSR to let its Jews emigrate to [[Israel]]. Morocco encourages [[Israel]]i </p>
<p>106 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>tourism, with many [[Israel]]is taking advantage of it, using their [[Israel]]i 
passports for the purpose. The actual relations of [[Israel]] with Tunisia 
are quite close, and with [[Oman]] even more so, since as long ago as 
[[1968]]. The only extremist Arab country which does not [[trade]] with 
[[Israel]] is [[Algeria]], which can be accounted for by distance and by 
[[French]] competition rather than by any ideological commitments. </p>
<p>The same facts call for yet another generalization. All this 
voluminous [[trade]] can take place only because of the absence of 
democracy and freedom of expression in the Arab world. It is 
greatly enhanced by the customary bribery and other forms of 
corruption rampant in Arab bureaucracies. In this respect the 
Palestinians are by no means an exception. Many of them must by 
necessity be aware of the situation as described in this report, but 
denied both the access to information and the right to speak their 
minds under the prevailing repression they delude themselves 
about the attitudes of both the Arab states and individual Arab 
purchasers towards [[Israel]]i goods. This holds particularly true about 
the so-called ‘left’ factions within the PLO which have always 
servilely refrained from criticizing the ‘radical’ Arab regimes for their 
trading with [[Israel]] on terms advantageous to the latter. The same 
holds no less true about other ‘left’ Arab intellectuals, especially 
on the [[Egypt]]ian left. </p>
<p>Much evidence points to the fact that [[Israel]] has consistently 
opposed any developments towards democracy in all neighbouring 
countries. I have firmly believed, for more than 25 years, that this 
opposition stems not only from political but also from economic 
considerations. The [[Israel]]i-Arab [[trade]] rests on deceit and corruption 
on both sides. Yet it could be carried out normally and openly with 
tremendous advantages for the peoples of both sides. The primary 
barrier to the normalization of this [[trade]] is the refusal of [[Israel]] to 
renounce the Occupied [[Territories]] for the sake of peace. But the 
absence of democracy and freedom of expression in the Arab states 
and Palestinian society, together with the concomitant delusions 
bound to ensnare people under such conditions, can be seen as 
prerequisite to the success of these [[Israel]]i policies. But the US lends 
its helping hand, by opposing the developments toward democracy 
in the Middle East as well. It can be surmised that economic 
considerations play a part in current [[America]]n policies. Yet in my 
opinion, a peaceful and prosperous Middle East is likely to be a 
better market for [[America]]n exports (weaponry excepted) than a 
war-torn one. Thus it is political considerations, such as the 
in[[flu]]ence of organized US Jewry which helps shape US policies no 
less than the hope of making profits. </p>
<p>Note: On 26 [[April]], an article by Gad Gilber (“The labels are not 
being checked’) appeared in [[Haaretz]]. Without adding anything new, 
the article repeats what Ein-Dor had already reported about 
Gilber’s lecture. </p>

<p>[[Drugs]] and Vegetables: ‘The [[Israel]] 
‘Trade with Arab Countries 
26 [[August]] [[1994]] </p>
<p>The ever-increasing volume of [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with Arab countries is 
certainly one of the important factors of Middle [[Eastern]] politics, 
but reliable information about it is hard to come by. My report of 
26 [[April]] [[1991]] recounted the [[history]] of the development of this [[trade]]. 
Since then I haven’t seen any novel sources of important 
information, though incidental information from various sources 
became in [[1994]] much more abundant. This dearth of information 
could be explained by [[Israel]]i censorship seeing to it that the subject 
be never explicitly mentioned in the media except when it would 
suit its purposes. In the Arab countries press reports obviously 
inspired by authorities have kept appearing, proudly asserting the 
boycott’s success. The Palestinian press in particular has done its 
best to maintain this illusion. Such prevarications still go on. </p>
<p>Since then [[Israel]]i military censorship has been somewhat relaxed, 
with the result that I can now supply further information. The first 
part of this report deals with [[Israel]]i exports of vegetables, fruit, 
flowers and marginally of other produce to Arab countries. It relies 
on two articles by Ronen Bergman (Ha’r, Tel Aviv’s Friday paper, 
15 and 22 [[July]] [[1994]]) which, as the author admits, rely exclusively 
on the official [[Israel]]i sources. The second part of this report, 
describing the cooperation of [[Israel]]i Security Services with drug 
merchants in return for intelligence the latter supply, 1s based on 
information provided by [[Israel]]i lawyers defending Lebanese drug 
merchants kidnapped and brought before [[Israel]]i courts. Their 
story appeared in an article by Etty Hassid ( Yerushalaim, Jerusalem’s 
Friday paper, 22 [[July]]). While censorship didn’t prevent the 
publication of the article in question it did prevent all other Hebrew 
papers from uttering a single word in response to the deeply 
disturbing facts revealed by Hassid and never subsequently denied. 
Incidentally, both parts of this report, but especially the second, 
will shed some light upon the rather narrow limits of [[Israel]]i 
democracy. </p>
<p>Bergman deals with those exports of [[Israel]]i agricultural produce 
(plus salt and [[sugar]]) to Arab countries which, regardless of their </p>
<p>107 </p>
<p>108 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>ultimate destination, after leaving [[Israel]] pass through [[Lebanon]]. 
Although some exports passed and still pass through Jordan, they 
must by necessity be ignored here. Let me note, however, one crucial 
difference between the two routes. The Jordanian border with 
[[Israel]] is ‘normal’ in regard to [[trade]]. Merchandise is checked. 
Without a valid permit nothing 1s allowed to pass. By contrast, since 
the [[June]] [[1982]] [[Israel]]i invasion of [[Lebanon]], there have been no 
Lebanese border controls on its border with [[Israel]] or with the 
Security Zone. [[Israel]] alone decides who and what can enter [[Lebanon]] 
through this border. The border posts between the territory 
controlled by [[Israel]] (the ‘Security Zone’) and the Lebanese territory 
to the north of it do bar the entry of unwelcome individuals and 
merchandise from [[Lebanon]] to the Zone and then to [[Israel]] but are 
passable in the reverse direction. The only Lebanese politician 
who demanded a reinstatement of customs and custom barriers 
between [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]] was [[Lebanon]]’s [[President]]-elect Bashir 
Jumail at his meeting with Begin in Nahariya. Begin angrily turned 
down this demand. One may speculate that Jumail’s demand for 
reinstatement of the custom controls was the main cause of his 
imminent [[assassination]]. </p>
<p>Bergman says (15 [[July]]) that [[Lebanon]] is treated by [[Israel]] as an 
ordinary export country. By [[Israel]]i law, agricultural exports are a 
monopoly of the [[government]]-owned [[company]] Agrexco. The 
director of Agrexco’s Lebanese department, Yossi Tzafrir, and its 
spokesman Hayim Keller were Bergman’s sources of information. 
But Bergman was also helped by the director of the Lebanese 
department in the Agriculture Ministry, Benny Gabbay. Although 
Bergman does not say it explicitly, he must have also derived some 
information from the [[Israel]]i Army, Shabak and Military Intelligence. 
Without their permission, he could not have interviewed veterans 
of the “[[South]] Lebanese Army’ (SLA), or quoted some of [[Israel]]i 
Intelligence’s assessments of its own role in the whole business. In 
view of Bergman’s dependence on official [[Israel]]i sources, I will often 
need to add my own comments. </p>
<p>According to Bergman large-scale [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with [[Lebanon]] 
began ‘twelve years ago’, that is, in [[1982]]. He doesn’t mention the 
‘coincidential’ circumstance that this was the year of the invasion 
of [[Lebanon]], nor that [[Israel]]i-Lebanese [[trade]] could soar only due 
to that invasion. Though this has hardly been realized, the ‘Peace 
for the Galilee’ [[War]] was to a large extent a [[trade]] war, comparable 
with, say, the Opium [[War]]s, or the [[trade]] wars of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries. [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with [[Lebanon]], and through 
it with Arab countries, has peculiar characteristics. It is monopolistic 
— the sales take place only in selected localities, where they are 
overseen by the military. Actually, the [[Israel]]i use of military coercion 
in trading bears resemblance to the earlier forms of western [[trade]] </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE — 109 </p>
<p>with Asian countries. True, the [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with [[Lebanon]] began 
according to Bergman before [[1982]], indeed, in [[1979]] (though I would 
say even earlier —in [[1974]] under the cover of Shimon Peres’ ‘Good 
Fence’). However, before invasion, this [[trade]] was small-scale and 
limited to areas controlled by the Falangists. The monopoly of [[trade]] 
with the Falangist zone of Beirut and the Falangist enclave to the 
north of it was granted to Camille Chamoun and in [[South]] [[Lebanon]] 
to Major Sa’ed Haddad; in both cases as a reward for political 
collaboration. ‘But’, says Tzafrir, ‘only since [[1982]] has the entire 
[[Lebanon]] stood open to [[Israel]]i [[trade]].’ </p>
<p>Tzafrir insists that tough measures on the part of the [[Israel]]i 
security forces (their exact nature is not specified) were needed after 
the invasion to enforce the monopoly of Agrexco and protect ‘the 
interests of Jewish farmers’. Anyhow, owing to action of the security 
forces, ‘the initial disarray’, when ‘Arab farmers from the Galilee 
were allowed to enter [[Lebanon]] and sell their produce there’ was 
speedily put to an end: ‘Agrexco, in its capacity of authorized state 
monopoly, requested the Army to act with dispatch against the Arab 
interlopers.’ Also, ‘permits issued to some Lebanese merchants who 
would arrive in Haifa Agricultural Exchange with suitcases full of 
dollars to compete with us there’ needed to be cancelled. Tzafrir 
describes that competition as ‘particularly precarious for us, because 
the Lebanese merchants were as clever as the Jews’. Border controls 
were reinstated and the Lebanese and unauthorized [[Israel]]is were 
as arule denied the right to cross it. Agrexco alone could from then 
on deliver [[Israel]]i agricultural produce to locations right behind the 
Lebanese border. Few duly authorized Lebanese merchants could 
appear at those locations in order to buy what they were offered, 
reload the merchandise on to their trucks and transport it to 
wherever they pleased. But, complains Tzafrir, after the [[June]] [[1985]] 
[[Israel]]i withdrawal from a large chunk of [[South]] [[Lebanon]], ‘land traffic 
became problematic.’ At first [[Israel]] approached the SLA for help. 
Bergman does not say what this ‘help’ was: he only complains about 
the SLA’s incompetence and obstacles set up by its commander, 
General Lahad, to operations of [[Israel]]i [[trade]]. He gives some 
examples: ‘At all stages of [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with [[Lebanon]] and other Arab 
countries, senior SLA officers insisted on pocketing a hefty share 
of the profits. Worse still, General Lahad’s private driver was one 
of the main go-betweens between [[Israel]] and the Lebanese 
merchants, notwithstanding the fact that [[Israel]]i Army branded 
him as a ‘butterfly’ on account of his cowardice.’ Bergman’s article 
of 22 [[July]] describes in detail how General Lahad would from time 
to time (apparently when he felt relatively strong vis-a-vis [[Israel]]) 
temporarily ban imports of specific commodities into his ‘Zone’ 
in order to thus extort a heftier bribe. </p>
<p>110 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>It was thus found advisable to search for a [[trade]] route that 
would not depend on Lahad’s good graces. The first solution 
adopted was to let some major interested Lebanese merchants live 
in [[Israel]] and thus place them beyond Lahad’s reach. In his 15 [[July]] 
article Bergman portrays one of the richest among those merchants, 
Amin E]-Haj: ‘Although Shiite, he was an old political ally of 
Camille Chamoun. For over 15 years he was handling a large part 
of [[Israel]]i [[trade]] with [[Lebanon]], and indirectly with many other Arab 
countries.” Let me add that [[Israel]] wanted to appoint him as a 
virtual feudal lord of the entire Shi’ite-inhabited area of [[South]] 
[[Lebanon]], except that the local population rebelled, first against him 
and then against the [[Israel]]i troops behind him. It was this [[rebellion]] 
which led to the establishment of Hizbollah in [[South]] [[Lebanon]]: 
‘Right now he is living in a luxurious suite in Nahariya [in [[Israel]]], 
connected by a special phone line to the central Lebanese phone- 
exchange.’ The next solution in bypassing Lahad was to construct 
a harbour in Nakura which, although located in the ‘Zone’, was 
made off-limits to the SLA. From Nakura, ships took [[Israel]]i 
produce to Beirut and other Lebanese ports: ‘Sometimes those ships 
would be escorted by an [[Israel]]i Navy warship up to some safe 
distance from Beirut.’ Actually, explains Tzafrir, most of those ships, 
‘which navigate under the flags of various Latin [[America]]n countries’, 
don’t depart from Nakura, except in their records: “They really 
depart from Haifa or Ashdod.’ Needless to say, the uninterrupted 
and massive presence of the [[Israel]]i Navy in Lebanese territorial 
waters, although normally justified as an ‘anti-terrorist measure’, 
is in the main intended to protect the [[Israel]]i [[trade]]. </p>
<p>Yet unexpected incidents sometimes occur. Bergman tells how 
‘in [[March]] [[1990]] the crew of one of Amin El-Haj’s ships declared 
a strike precisely when the ship was anchored in Haifa. The strikers 
even turned for help to the [[Israel]]i Union of Merchant Marine 
Officers.’ They were fortunate to turn to that union, rather than 
to the larger one of Merchant Marine Crewmen which is Histadrut- 
affiliated. The independent union agreed to help Amin El-Haj’s 
crew, whereas the Histadrut ([[trade]] union) bosses controlling the 
latter union dutifully consulted the secret police and refused to do 
anything: ‘A quick inspection by the [[Israel]]i union revealed 
something strange. There was no record of the ship’s entry into 
the port of Haifa, and no document naming any past or future ports 
of the ship’s call, or indication of the origin of its cargo. Officially, 
the ship didn’t exist. In the entire management of the port of Haifa 
there was no one capable of informing the union inspectors to whom 
the ship belonged, where it sailed from and what was its destination.’ 
The absence of documentation created the appearance of a pirate 
ship. At this point Bergman breaks his narrative. Of course, [[Israel]]i 
censorship clamped down on any further news. According to my </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE 111 </p>
<p>sources, after several days, a gang arrived from no one could tell 
where, boarded and took over the ship forcibly under the protection 
of [[Israel]]i troops and made it depart from Haifa immediately. 
Nothing is known for certain about the fate of the striking crew, 
but they are presumed to be dead. </p>
<p>The nature of [[Israel]]i agricultural exports to [[Lebanon]] changed 
in [[1985]], after the [[Israel]]i pull-out from large chunks of Lebanese 
territory. In [[1982]]-85, as Tzafrir admits, [[Israel]] used [[Lebanon]] 
primarily as a dumping ground for its variegated agricultural 
surpluses, including such cheap vegetables as [[tomatoes]], and 
secondarily as a destination for [[South]] [[Africa]]n exports then boycotted 
by [[Europe]]. Tzafrir recounts with pride how, with the help of the 
[[Israel]]i national airline El Al he organized exports of [[South]] [[Africa]]n 
avocados to [[Lebanon]]. He also talks about sales of [[Israel]]i bananas 
to [[Lebanon]], without mentioning that [[Lebanon]] itself was a large- 
scale banana producing country. Nor does he mention that the 
[[Israel]]i Army helped Agrexco sell its wares and in the process ruin 
the Lebanese peasants by imposing bothersome prohibitions, like 
forbidding them to sell their produce before 11 a.m. or seeing to 
it that [[Israel]]i produce is sold before allowing other sales. In my view, 
the major cause of outbreak of guerilla [[warfare]] in the occupied areas 
of [[Lebanon]] were such [[Israel]]i commercial practices. But corruption 
in Syria, then much greater than today, also played a role. Tzafrir 
recounts how Lebanese merchants trading in [[1982]]-85 with Agrexco 
would re-export part of their purchases to Syria, in particular to 
Damascus, ‘since Rifat [[Assad]] [Hafez [[Assad]]’s brother, now exiled 
from Syria] then in charge of the Syrian [[trade]], was amenable to 
anything when offered a suitable bribe’. I can confirm this 
information from my own sources, with the addition that the 
belated discovery of Rifat [[Assad]]’s involvement in illicit [[trade]] with 
[[Israel]] was probably the main reason for his subsequent exile. </p>
<p>Naturally, after the [[1985]] [[Israel]]i withdrawal such forms of ‘export’ 
had to cease. Iwo cheap exports to [[Lebanon]] which survived 
withdrawal are salt, which according to Tzafrir is destined mainly 
for the Iraqi market and [[sugar]], which according to my sources ends 
up in the Gulf states. The post-[[1985]] [[Israel]]i exports to and via 
[[Lebanon]] can be said to be of a two-fold nature. On the one hand 
there are some cheap mass-produced items like eggs or poultry 
which in [[Israel]] are heavily subsidized and whose production is 
reserved for poor Jewish farmers, especially in the Galilee. The 
second category is made up by the more expensive vegetables, fruits 
(for example, avocados) and flowers, whose production is reserved 
for wealthy Jewish farmers. Most of the expensive produce is 
exported via [[Lebanon]] to the Gulf states where there are enough 
people of means to create a demand for them. Thus, Bergman tells 
stories about how [[Israel]]i mangoes are de ngueur in expensive </p>
<p>112 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>restaurants in one Gulf Emirate, whereas [[Israel]]i roses are de ngueur 
for sumptuous weddings in another. </p>
<p>In other words, [[Israel]]i exports to the Arab countries have been 
since [[1985]] guided by the rules of apartheid. At the same time, the 
tame acceptance of [[Israel]]i apartheid practices by Arab upper classes 
is symptomatic of the community of interests between those classes 
and [[Israel]]. In [[Israel]], agriculture is mainly run by the state and guided 
by racist principles which can be enforced readily because no one 
can farm anything without [[government]] permits whose distribution 
can be totally arbitrary. Let me quote some figures concerning those 
products which according to Bergman tend to be exported most 
to and via [[Lebanon]] since [[1985]]. My figures are derived from The 
Statistical Abstract of [[Israel]], [[1991]] which provides the data for [[1990]] 
and which clearly distinguishes between what is produced on 
‘Jewish farms’ and ‘non-Jewish farms’. (The proportions recorded 
below have hardly changed since.) The data for the agricultural [[crops]] 
are in thousands of dunams of cultivated land: </p>
<p>Jewish farms Non-Jewish farms </p>
<p>Peas for canning 22:3 0 
Cotton 319.0 0.8 
Groundnuts yA) ae 1.6 
Avocado 98.5 1.0 
Bananas 18.3 0 
Roses 2.1 0 
Poultry (in thousands of livestock) 26,990 250 </p>
<p>No data about the production of eggs are provided in the Abstract, but in 
all likeliood they are roughly proportional to those concerning poultry. </p>
<p>These figures should be juxtaposed not only with the proportion 
of Arabs in [[Israel]] (about 17 per cent in [[1990]]) but also with the 
ratio of Jewish to Arab farmers, excluding seasonal workers, 
employed in agriculture: 50,600 Jews compared to 20,300 Non- 
Jews (28.6 per cent). </p>
<p>Etty Hassid’s article shows the complementary aspects of [[Israel]]1 
[[trade]] relations with Arab countries. She offers her conclusions in 
the very beginning of her article: ‘Even though it may be hard to 
believe, the State of [[Israel]] is actively engaged in the drug [[trade]], 
especially on its northern Lebanese borders. The participants are 
on one side the [[Israel]]i Army, Shabak, Mossad and the [[Israel]]i police 
and on the other side Lebanese drug merchants, [[Israel]]i Bedouins 
from the Negev and some retired [[[Israel]]i] senior officers. The 
operational principle is: We will close our eyes to all the filth you 
stoop to, and even give you money, if only you provide us with 
intelligence of interest to us. In my article I am going to prove it 
or at least to substantiate it as highly probable on the basis of the </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE 113 </p>
<p>trials of large-scale drug merchants. Since I was forced by the 
censors to skip some facts, let me tell you that the realities are even 
more ghastly than what you can find here. True, what I do reveal 
is ghastly enough. It turns out that State of [[Israel]], which professes 
to wage an uncompromising struggle with the [[epidemic]] of drug 
addiction, is in reality the largest-scale importer of [[drugs]] in the 
Middle East. It is as if we were trying with one hand to apprehend 
the drug users and peddlers, or at least pretending to do so, while 
using the other hand to plunge the syringe deep into the drug 
addict’s veins.’ </p>
<p>As evidence for this conclusion, Hassid uses the transcripts of 
secret trials of both [[Israel]]is and Lebanese charged with drug 
offenses. But she also says that ‘in recent years a number of 
publications have appeared abroad disclosing information about 
involvement in the drug [[trade]] by individuals serving in the [[Israel]]i 
Security Services.’ She discusses in detail only one such affair 
which she investigated by approaching the [[Israel]]i lawyers of one 
defendant so involved, Yosef Amit, formerly a major in the Military 
Intelligence Unit 504. According to a London magazine Foreign 
Report of [[July]] [[1993]], the unit was known as ‘mini-Mossad’. As, may 
happen to people in ‘the only democracy of the Middle East’, 
Amit ‘disappeared’ in [[1986]] and even his name couldn’t be 
mentioned in the media. Only after the Foreign Report’s publication 
in London was it admitted in [[Israel]] that he was secretly [[sentenced]] 
to im[[prison]]ment for unspecified ‘security offences’. However, he 
was im[[prison]]ed under luxurious conditions. Among his privileges, 
he was allowed to spend long hours in phone conversations with 
Hebrew press journalists to whom he professed his innocence. 
When they then queried the [[Israel]]i authorities they were told that 
Amit was insane. Renowned psychologists would confirm this 
diagnosis to any journalist concerned. For some unexplained 
reason, however, neither Amit’s lawyers nor his family could ever 
see any document that would certify Amit’s supposed insanity. Only 
after seven years were the journalists in question permitted to say 
they had had phone conversations with Amit, some (still unnamed) 
authorities and some (still unnamed) psychologists. Even after 
[[July]] [[1993]], the only fact disclosed was that his offence had had 
something to do with [[Lebanon]]. Moreover, the Foreign Report 
disclosures could still not be mentioned in [[Israel]], the reason, as 
conjectured by Hassid, being that it described Military Intelligence 
Unit 504 as recruiting agents, particularly ‘Arab ones’, remunerated 
by hashish acquired in the course of ‘special operations in the 
Bekaa district of [[Lebanon]]’. The drug was said to be stored in the 
unit’s warehouse in Tel Aviv and then transferred to Cairo whenever 
needed. Neither Hassid nor Foreign Report provide any information 
as to whether such transfers were approved by the [[Egypt]]ian 
authorities. Judging from clues provided by my sources, I would </p>
<p>114 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>conjecture that the [[Egypt]]ians (who profess their resolve to eradicate 
drug supplies) might well have been accomplices. According to 
Hassid, Amit’s subordinate was caught selling hashish ‘which was 
apparently derived from the Military Intelligence central stockpiles’ 
for his own profit. Since ‘suspicion rebounded on Amit’ he was 
also charged. </p>
<p>Hassid reports that ‘in the meantime Amit was released from 
[[prison]], on condition of keeping silence. Really, however, he 
disappeared raising a lot of question marks about his actual fate.’ 
Hassid has a tentative explanation of those ‘question marks’. A 
journalist with whom often Amit communicated by phone from 
[[prison]], Avi Valentin, wrote a novel entitled The Lost Truth. As a 
novel, it couldn’t be banned. Its plot, summarized by Hassid, runs 
as follows. The novel’s hero, Haggay Gur, ‘resembles Yosef Amit’ 
in biography, the character of Army service, his rank and ‘even in 
the number of the [[child]]ren and their gender’. His job in Military 
Intelligence is to protect Bedouin caravans delivering hashish from 
Jordan to [[Egypt]] ‘while extracting a share of the stuff for Military 
Intelligence’. Subsequently, he is transferred to make similar deals 
on the Lebanese border. Some of the thus acquired hashish is, 
according to the novel, ‘processed by known criminals cooperating 
with Military Intelligence’, into heroin and other hard [[drugs]], which 
are used ‘to pay Arab agents’. In my view some such practices may 
be routinely engaged in by [[Israel]]i Intelligence. </p>
<p>But Hassid had access to sources better than a novel: “The idea 
of using [[drugs]] and overseeing and mediating enormous-scale drug 
deals in order to remunerate Arab collaborators with [[Israel]], is 
confirmed by the so-called “police models”, used in [[Israel]] and 
abroad. Such models are known to some people outside of 
officialdom involved in investigations of Lebanese drug affairs and 
trials before [[Israel]]i courts resulting from those investigations. The 
existence of such models was also disclosed in court protocols 
ultimately cleared for publication.’ In Hassid’s view the drug affairs 
which have reached the courts ‘were only the tip of an iceberg’ of 
the drug smuggling condoned by [[Israel]]. The trials nevertheless led 
to the disclosure of two ‘police models’ used ‘by the [[Israel]]i Police, 
together with Lebanese Border Unit (LBV) and the special police 
unit “Yahalom” (“Diamond”], which jointly oversee the drug [[trade]] 
at enormous scale’. Those ‘models’ were explained to Hassid by 
advocate Meir Ziv who defended Colonel Meir Binyamin, a former 
LBU commander charged in [[1989]] with trading in hard [[drugs]]. </p>
<p>After a protracted trial in camera, Colonel Binyamin was acquitted 
by the court which accepted the argument that his undenied 
involvement in the drug [[trade]] was carried out under orders of his 
superiors and conformed to an ‘officially accepted method of 
trading in [[drugs]]’: “'wo Lebanese models were devised about ten </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE 115 </p>
<p>years ago by a special division of [[[Israel]]i] Police called “Maman” 
{an acronym for “intelligence department”’], in cooperation with 
the [[Attorney]] General’s Office.’ Their designer was Rafi Peled, 
then Deputy Commander of Maman who later advanced to the 
post of superintendent of the [[Israel]]i Police. (He had to resign from 
this job after less than one year, having been caught red-handed 
accepting a bribe from a hotel owner.) The approval of the [[Attorney]] 
General’s Office was sought because the Police feared it may be 
in trouble if its complicity with crime remains uncovered: “The first 
model is applied when an [[Israel]]i drug merchant asks the Police to 
either supply him with [[drugs]] of Lebanese origin or connect him 
with a Lebanese drug merchant. If the [[[Israel]]i] Police approve the 
request it becomes criminally liable on two counts: an incitement 
and involvement in drug [[trade]]. The second model is applied when 
an [[Israel]]i drug merchant approaches a Lebanese drug merchant 
who is an [[[Israel]]i] Police informer, and the Police help smuggle 
the merchandise across the border.’ After some de[[liberation]]s, the 
[[Attorney]] General’s Office approved the two models under some 
conditions, such as e.g. ‘if such a drug dealer 1s stuck 1n [[Israel]], the 
Police will help him return the [[drugs]] to [[Lebanon]].’ It meant, 
however, that the Police ‘condoned the deals in which Lebanese 
drug dealers were paid in hard currencies while in [[Israel]] which they 
exported to [[Lebanon]]’. The Police became concerned whether they 
themselves thereby didn’t become also criminally liable by infringing 
on foreign currency-related laws. The [[Israel]]i Treasury okayed the 
procedure ‘after being told that the deals with drug merchants are 
intended solely to improve the methods of suppressing the 
drug [[trade]]’. </p>
<p>However, it seems that the ‘models’ were not followed to the 
letter. Hassid’s sources discovered that in [[1988]], when the Police’s 
own Drug Division dealing with drug consumption in [[Israel]] had 
investigated the situation on the Lebanese border, it found that ‘the 
[Lebanese] drug [[trade]]rs were not put under adequate surveillance 
during their stay in [[Israel]].’ In one case it was found that ‘100 kg. 
of heroin, which is but a small part of the usual traffic’, couldn’t 
be accounted for by the surveillance. No wonder Colonel Meir 
Binyamin could plausibly claim at his trial that ‘in reality the [[Israel]]i 
authorities are manipulated by large-scale Lebanese drug [[trade]]rs 
exploiting their excellent relations with the [[[Israel]]i] Police for the 
sake of smuggling enormous quantities of [[drugs]] behind its back’. 
In substantiating this claim, two witnesses, both sub-contractors 
of a large-scale Lebanese drug [[trade]]sman Ramzi Nahara, ‘both with 
long records of cooperation with [[Israel]]’, testified that once they 
‘smuggled 250 kg. of heroin into [[Israel]]’ in a single swoop. Hassid 
explains that ‘such an amount suffices for up to a million retail doses 
of the drug’. Ramzi Nahara himself also testified. Hassid writes that </p>
<p>116 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>he complained against the two models as limiting the extent of his 
profiteering and so forcing him, against his better judgement ‘to 
make deals behind the back of the [[[Israel]]i] Police for the sake of 
profit maximization’. Hassid describes Nahara’s deals in great 
detail. I have selected to cover here only one of his feats. A single 
transport, detected in [[Israel]] by sheer chance by the traffic police 
due to a minor traffic infraction, consisted of 3,000 kg. of hashish 
destined for re-export to [[Egypt]]. Let me quote on this occasion an 
opinion of the advocate Meir Ziv with which I concur entirely: “The 
State of [[Israel]] is by far the largest importer of [[drugs]] into [[Israel]]. The 
importation is sponsored by the Police, under the hardly credible 
pretext that it will help catch drug offenders.’ </p>
<p>Another of Hassid’s sources was the well-known Jerusalemite 
advocate Avraham Bardugo ‘who in recent years had represented 
many Lebanese drug dealers. Bardugo states firmly that in all 
major drug smuggling cases in which he represented the defendants, 
the [[Israel]]i Security System had in one or another way been itself 
involved.’ To authenticate his claim he told Hassid about his 
representing Muhammad Biru, a Lebanese Shr’ite drug [[trade]]r. In 
response to Hassid’s queries ‘[{[[Israel]]i] security sources described 
Biru as the largest-scale Lebanese drug [[trade]]r.’ Hassid opines that 
‘Biru’s affair shows how intimately is the crime in [[South]] [[Lebanon]] 
intertwined with [[Israel]]i activities in that area’. In [[August]] [[1989]] Biru 
was kidnapped by the SLA and brought to [[Israel]] to stand trial. He 
was [[sentenced]] to 15 years of [[prison]] for a large and complex heroin 
deal made behind the back of the Police. Biru’s heroin was smuggled 
across the border ‘in a car of a Shabak agent codenamed “[[Assad]]””’. 
The transport was stumbled upon when it was about to be smuggled 
into the Gaza Strip. Biru keeps claiming that he had nothing to do 
with this particular deal. In spite of his im[[prison]]ment, ‘Biru 
continues to make business in [[drugs]] from within the [[[Israel]]i] [[prison]] 
of Shatta.’ Hassid reported that ‘an [[Egypt]]ian court [[sentenced]] Biru 
to [[death]] in absentia, and the Interpol is looking for him as well. 
One may ask why [[Israel]] wanted to hold Biru in its [[prison]] and to 
pay for years for his upkeep?’ The question remains unanswered, 
except that, as Hassid notes, ‘after [[Israel]] had kidnapped Sheikh 
Dirani, Hizbollah kidnapped Biru’s son and son-in-law, accusing 
them of having helped [[Israel]] kidnap Dirani.’ Biru’s other lawyer, 
the previously mentioned advocate Ziv, told Hassid that Biru had 
asked him ‘to approach for his sake the [[[Israel]]i] Health Minister 
Efraim Sneh. Apparently Biru and Sneh had amicable relations 
[during the latter’s service in the army in the [[1980]]s] when he was 
the commander of [[South]] [[Lebanon]].’ </p>
<p>The name of the [[Israel]]i advocate who told Hassid about another 
legal case 1s withheld. The case was that of a well-known SLA officer 
Ibrahim El-Sayad, who had been rising in rank until he became </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE 117 </p>
<p>‘the commander of the Shiite battalion of the SLA, maintaining 
amicable relations with the SLA commander, General Lahad and 
various [[Israel]]i army officers’. El-Sayad was incapacitated after 
stepping on a Hizbollah mine. On recovery, he was appointed 
liaison officer with Yahalom and a ‘senior partner’ of those [[Israel]]i 
forces applying the two Lebanese models ‘in [[South]] [[Lebanon]], in 
plain clothes, of course’. At some point (the date banned by 
censorship) he was brought by force to [[Israel]] and [[sentenced]] to twelve 
years of [[prison]]: “he charges against him were many, but only two 
have been cleared for publication. El-Sayad acted as an agent 
provocateur implicating the eventually convicted Major Hayim 
Shahar, a senior officer in the [[Israel]]i Army’s Liaison Unit with [[South]] 
[[Lebanon]] and commander of “Fatma Gate”, one of the important 
entry points between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]]. Exploiting this 
opportunity, Shahar smuggled enormous amounts of [[drugs]] to 
[[Israel]]. The second charge against El-Sayad had to do with 
[[November]] [[1991]] meeting with the highest Druze officer in the 
[[Israel]]i Army at that time, Colonel Mufir Mu’afak, who was later 
discharged from Army service.’ If the Shahar affair remains shrouded 
in mystery, in regard to the Mu/afak affair Hassid was able to learn 
a lot, some of that from Mu/’afak himself, who after four years of 
investigation had been tried, acquitted of all charges and discharged 
from the army. </p>
<p>Let me quote Hassid about Mu’afak at some length: “The offices 
of the command of the Liaison Unit with [[South]] [[Lebanon]] are 
located in a building in Marjayoun [a town serving as ‘capital’ of 
the ‘Security Zone’] two floors above Yahalom offices. One day 
El-Sayad mounted those two floors to meet Colonel Mu/afak. 
Sitting down on a chair in Mu’afak’s office, El-Sayad told him: “We 
know that you are going to retire from the army soon. This is why 
we request you to help us transport 100 kg. of heroin into our area.” 
Colonel Mu’afak became enraged and summoned his soldiers, 
who surrounded El-Sayad. Next he contacted the Yahalom office 
which sent men to arrest El-Sayad and interrogate him on the spot. 
El-Sayad admitted that he had made a proposal of this nature to 
Mu’ afak but explained that he did so on orders of his superiors who 
sought evidence to enable them to put Mu/’afak on trial. Yahalom 
functionaries, in their turn, did admit that they had used El-Sayad 
as an agent provocateur on other occasions, but denied that they had 
authorized him to act to implicate Mu’afak. The conclusion was 
that El-Sayad this time wanted to make a real drug deal. El-Sayad 
retorted: “Your real aim is to appease the Druze community in 
[[Israel]]. For that you are scapegoating me.” To the disappointment 
of Shi’ites who served under El-Sayad’s command he was brought 
to [[Israel]]. The ties between [[Israel]] and the Shi’ites of the Zone were 
by then strained: the case in this discussion is believed to have </p>
<p>118 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>contributed to their complete severance. In [[Israel]] El-Sayad was put 
on trial before District Judge Zu’abi, who specialized in such cases.’ 
(It may not be irrelevant to mention that Judge Zu’abi also served 
as a member of the Shamgar Inquiry Committee investigating the 
Goldstein massacre in Hebron.) ‘Since no [[drugs]] were found on E]- 
Sayad, his trial in camera focused on the meaning of what he said 
to Mu’afak, especially on the words “our area’. If those words 
referred to [[Lebanon]] an [[Israel]]i court had no power to deal with the 
case. After this question was resolved, the court began deliberating 
whether El-Sayad acted as an agent provocateur or as a drug dealer. </p>
<p>‘El-Sayad wanted to prove the former by describing the methods 
he had used while working for Yahalom. But here he encountered 
a difficulty. The Police Minister issued an order of secrecy in the 
name of protecting state security, as rigid as had never before been 
issued in the [[history]] of [[Israel]]i judiciary. The lawyers for the defence 
were prohibited by that order from summoning witnesses or 
referring to issues other than those approved by the Minister in 
advance. On top of that, the defendant was prohibited from 
testifying in his own defence on anything he had done in the past. 
On the other hand, the prosecution encountered no obstacles in 
summoning Nassif Biru, Muhammad Biru’s oldest son to testify 
against El-Sayad. Under cross-examination by the defence, Nassif 
Biru admitted that he was still overseeing the world-wide drug 
dealings of the Biru family, while collaborating with [[Israel]]i 
authorities, in particular with the Yahalom unit. In the latter 
capacity he helped supply evidence needed to convict Major Hayim 
Shahar. We cannot reveal anything else about this part of his 
testimony.’ </p>
<p>In another part of Nassif Biru’s testimony there was revelation 
which ‘stunned those who fancied themselves as knowledgeable 
about the Biru family’s affairs. After Muhammad Biru was [[sentenced]] 
to 15 years, his family petitioned the Supreme Court for the night 
to visit him in [[prison]]. The State of [[Israel]] objected, arguing that 
visits should not be allowed, because Muhammad Biru continued 
to direct the drug traffic from within the [[prison]]. Incidentally, the 
state’s objection applied in particular to the visits of Muhammad’s 
son Nassif.’ Unfortunately, censorship banned the publication of 
the Supreme Court’s de[[liberation]]s of this case; this is why nothing 
can be said about the nature of its response to the state’s argument: 
‘Strangely enough, in his testimony in the El-Sayad case, 
Muhammad Biru, who was also a state witness, testified that his 
son Nassif was after all allowed to visit him in [[prison]], on condition 
of being accompanied by security agents in plain clothes. The 
latter even took him out to luxurious nightclubs and other fleshpots 
where they entertained themselves together most amicably, except 
that the security agents kept trying to persuade him to talk.’ The </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE 119 </p>
<p>censors didn’t let it be specified what was he supposed to talk about. 
Hassid speculates that ‘they expected information about some sort 
of targets in [[Lebanon]]’. </p>
<p>Hassid assures her readers that there have been many other 
incidents which she couldn’t disclose. She concludes: “The apparent 
conclusion from those affairs is that the entire [[Israel]]i Security 
System — that is, the Police, Shabak, Mossad, Military Intelligence 
and such units as operate independently — are involved in drug deals. 
The supposed aims of those deals are to capture drug merchants, 
to obtain security-related information, money and whatever else 
that can be conceived. Methods used in such deals create a situation 
no less sensitive, lethal and explosive than nitroglycerine. [[Israel]]’s 
needs, real or imaginary, are compromised through gangsters’ 
account-settling, through vendettas between clans, through the 
untrammelled pursuit of profits, and so on. In the name of these 
sacred aims the State of [[Israel]] is either closing its eyes to, or even 
actively cooperating with and encouraging the drug [[trade]] on an 
enormous scale ... Regardless of other factors, performance of this 
type is bound to corrupt deeply the Security System officers 
involved. It cannot be assumed that every single [[Israel]]i Army or 
Intelligence officer can resist the temptation of pocketing huge sums 
of money likely to be offered to him by professional drug dealers. 
Let me ask: has it been calculated what proportion of [[drugs]] available 
on [[Israel]]i market were imported under the patronage of the Police, 
Army or other Security branches? Some reputable [[Israel]]i lawyers 
are perfectly willing to testify under oath that [[Israel]] is the largest- 
scale importer of heroin into its own territory. </p>
<p>“The [[Israel]]i Army spokesman requested by me to comment on 
some issues tangential to this article, refused adamantly. He only 
said: “All this is claptrap”.’ Together with the mentioned ban on 
further disclosures, this comment is in my view the best confirmation 
of the accuracy of Hassid’s revelations. </p>
<p>The Mu/’afak affair had an interesting sequel. After about four 
years in detention he was recently completely exonerated and 
freed. He then described in interviews to the Hebrew papers a 
method of interrogation which had been used against him. He was 
brought every morning at 8 a.m. to some office in Tel Aviv where 
an interrogator would ask him whether he wanted to confess. On 
his refusal, he would be handcuffed and chained to the chair he 
was sitting on until 4 p.m. During that time the handcuffs would 
be once removed to let him have lunch and he would be allowed 
to go the restroom under guard, but only ‘infrequently’. This went 
on for eight months, six days a week. (Torture is in [[Israel]] not 
inflicted on Saturdays except in emergency cases, so that the Jewish 
torturers would not violate the Sabbath.) I have two comments on 
the story. First, the form of ‘moderate physical pressure’ (as torture </p>
<p>120 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>is officially referred to in [[Israel]]) applied against Colonel Mu/’afak 
was indeed moderate if compared to torture routinely applied 
against non-Jews. For example, others are being chained to a very 
small chair rather than to an ordinary one, so as to inflict more pain. 
Secondly, no Jew charged with drug offences, [[spy]]ing or security 
offenses in the last thirty years has ever complained of being 
tortured. Like so much else in [[Israel]], the use of torture is subject 
to rules of apartheid: applicable only to non-Jews, no matter what 
their Army rank may be. </p>
<p>The facts described in this report warrant some general 
conclusions. First, [[Israel]]i agricultural produce re-exported from 
[[Lebanon]] to other Arab countries must transit through Syria. 
Considering the bulkiness of the commodities and their 
uninterrupted flow, their transit cannot take place without the 
connivance of Syrian authorities, probably in return for payments. 
There exists some evidence that some cheaper produce, 1n particular 
eggs, are in fact destined for the Syrian market. After all, in recent 
years not a few [[Israel]]i Jews with double citizenship have visited Syria. 
Some of them do speak Arabic, so that they were in the position 
to engage in friendly conversations with people in the bazaars of 
Syrian cities. They noticed that [[Israel]]i eggs are commonly on 
display in these bazaars, and that both buyers and sellers were aware 
of their [[Israel]]i origin, even though this fact is never mentioned in 
the strictly controlled Syrian media. The same happens with textiles. 
This fact casts some light on an usually ignored aspect of Syrian- 
[[Israel]]i relations: namely that there exists covert cooperation 
alongside overt hostility. The same is the case in [[Israel]]i relations 
with Arab countries with which [[Israel]] is trading. This cooperation 
is not a side-effect of ‘the peace process’ with the Palestinians, the 
best proof being that it existed earlier and independently from it. 
The [[trade]] in question proves, contrary to the conventional wisdoms, 
that [[Israel]]i policies are regional in nature and that [[Israel]]i oppression 
of the Palestinians is only one and not even the most important 
aspect of those policies. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]i involvement in the drug [[trade]] warrants even more 
important conclusions in regard to the nature of political realities 
in the Middle East. In the first place, we should bear in mind the 
date when the two [[Israel]]i Police ‘models’ were approved. The 
conclusion is inescapable that [[Israel]]i involvement in drug trafficking 
in [[Lebanon]] was initiated by the ‘national unity [[government]]’ formed 
after the [[1984]] elections, that is, by the twin architects of ‘the peace 
process’, Shimon Peres who then became Prime Minister and his 
Defence Minister, Yitzhak Rabin. </p>
<p>Second, there are grounds to suspect that [[Israel]]i encouragement 
of the drug [[trade]] and consequently also of drug consumption, 
cannot be entirely explained by the categories of acquiring </p>
<p>DRUGS AND VEGETABLES: ISRAELI-ARAB TRADE 121 </p>
<p>intelligence, extending in[[flu]]ence and reaping profits. Part of the 
motivation must have been to weaken the disaffection of Middle 
[[Eastern]] masses with policies of their [[government]]s ([[Israel]]i and 
Arab alike) by encouraging drug addiction and thereby political 
apathy. The suspicion can be buttressed if we consider the effects 
of [[Israel]]i succour for Lebanese drug traffickers upon the Lebanese 
population (a factor which Hassid probably is not allowed to 
discuss by censorship), and the well-known facts about the 
encouragement of Palestinian drug dealers by [[Israel]]i occupation 
authorities. The coddling of Palestinian drug dealers was one of 
the reasons of the outbreak for the Intifada, but it was resumed 
in [[1991]]. </p>
<p>Lastly, massive involvement of [[Israel]]i Intelligence in drug 
trafficking must be well known to (and 1s probably approved by) 
its [[America]]n opposite numbers. Ample precedents for that exist. 
During the [[Vietnam]] [[War]] the [[CIA]] was engaged in encouraging its 
allies in drug trafficking. Moreover, US indirect support for the 
[[Israel]]i drug [[trade]] is much safer than direct involvement in this 
business. If [[Israel]]i involvement in the drug [[trade]] were exposed in 
the US, some powerful organizations such as the [[America]]n [[Israel]]i 
Political Action Committee (AIPAC) and organized [[America]]n 
Jewry in general would scream bloody murder. A lot of [[America]]n 
liberals, usually happy to denounce [[America]]n Intelligence for 
encouraging drug traffickers, would [[protest]] if [[Israel]]i Intelligence 
were denounced for anything. The combined in[[flu]]ence of organized 
[[America]]n Jews and such pseudo-liberals upon the US media is 
immeasurable. The invasion of Panama was said to be launched 
for the sake of suppressing the drug [[trade]]: yet well-documented 
[[Israel]]i connections with Noriega passed almost unnoticed in the 
US. It can therefore be tentatively presumed that in its 
encouragement of drug traffic and traffickers, as in much else, [[Israel]] 
acts as a proxy executor of the [[America]]n will. This would at least 
partly explain why this policy works. </p>
<p>But it works for another reason as well. All reporting on Lebanese 
affairs since the [[Israel]]i withdrawal to the borders of the ‘Zone’ in 
[[June]] [[1985]] has been subject to censorship then imposed by Peres. 
Since then Hebrew press journalists can enter the ‘Zone’ only in 
exceptional instances. As Ron Ben-Yishay (Yedior Ahronot, 17 
[[August]]) wrote, the censorship run by the [[North]]ern Command of 
the [[Israel]]i Army in charge of Lebanese affairs (in place of [[Israel]]i 
censorship), is strict enough to see to it that ‘very little information 
reaches the [[[Israel]]i] public’, and that ‘senior [[government]] officials 
can never be sure if they indeed have all relevant information.’ Ben- 
Yishay says that ‘it is difficult to understand how the Chief-of-Staff 
lets the [[North]]ern Command commander treat [[Lebanon]] as his 
private estate and use his military censorship to deny the [[Israel]]i </p>
<p>122 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>public meaningful information.’ Ben-Yishay also noted ‘a suspicion 
angrily voiced by a senior [[government]] minister in Jerusalem that 
“sometimes it is Hizbollah which tells the truth”’. </p>
<p>Finally, the reluctance of most Arab intellectuals to discuss the 
issue of drug addiction in their society plays into [[Israel]]i hands and 
only helps [[Israel]] encourage Arab drug addiction. Generalized and 
often incorrect claims about [[Israel]]i ‘subversion of the Arab culture’ 
cannot substitute for the badly needed open and democratic 
discussion of the issues. [[Israel]]i policies depend on cooperation and 
support not only of the Arab regimes but also of some social classes 
in Arab society. Far from proving that [[Israel]] is ‘an alien body in 
the Middle East’ as many Arab intellectuals like to claim, [[Israel]]i 
policies show that [[Israel]] is adapting remarkably successfully to 
what is worst in the Middle East and that it knows how to exploit 
it to its advantage. Boycotts (whether real or faked) didn’t stop [[Israel]]i 
[[trade]] in agricultural produce and will not help against [[Israel]]i 
encouragement of the drug traffic. The only way of effectually 
opposing such policies is the implementation of democracy in 
general and freedom of expression in particular, because only in 
this way can real issues be analysed and effective remedies devised. </p>

<p>[[Israel]] and the Organized [[America]]n Jews 
20 [[September]] [[1993]] </p>
<p>The politically prodigious and financially unprecedented support 
which [[Israel]] has received from the US since the early [[1960]]s can 
be attributed to two reasons. On the one hand, [[Israel]]i policies do 
serve [[America]]n interests, not only in the Middle East but all over 
the world. Whenever the US finds it inconvenient to get directly 
involved in a particularly unsavoury act, for example, in supporting 
a regime or an organization whose reputation 1s particularly heinous, 
[[Israel]] comes in handy to do the job on the US’s behalf. On the other 
hand, [[Israel]] wields a tremendous in[[flu]]ence within the US, in my 
view regardless of whether [[Israel]]i policies accord with US interests 
or not. Although to some extent this can be attributed to the 
support [[Israel]] receives from many strains of Christian 
funda[[mental]]ism, there is no doubt in my mind that its primary 
reason is the role performed by the organized Jewish community 
in the US in backing [[Israel]] and its policies. The proportion of 
organized Jews within the body of US Jewry can be roughly 
estimated as close to 50 per cent. Here I will describe the newly 
emerging strained relations between the organized [[America]]n Jews 
and the Rabin regime, and their impact on possible shifts in the 
extent of [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence upon US policies. </p>
<p>Curiously, [[Canada]] represents a case where in[[flu]]ence of its 
organized Jewish community upon that country’s policies is even 
more palpable than in the US. The effect is that, although [[Canada]]’s 
interests in the Middle [[Eastern]] are quite secondary, its dedication 
to [[Israel]] surpasses even that of the US. In both countries, major 
Jewish organizations support [[Israel]] as loyally and unconditionally 
as the Communist parties for so long used to in regard to the 
USSR. [[Israel]]is are well-aware that the chauvinism and fanaticism 
of organized Jews in those two countries in supporting [[Israel]] 
exceeds by far the chauvinism of the average [[Israel]]i Jew. </p>
<p>Why should some [[America]]n Jews be so inclined to pro-[[Israel]]i 
chauvinism? The first factor is the exclusivism of Jewish 
organizations. They do not admit non-Jews in their ranks and 
draw social and therefore also political power from that fact. Those 
who can be called ‘organized Jews’ spend most of their leisure time </p>
<p>125 </p>
<p>126 OPEN SECKETS </p>
<p>solely in the [[company]] of other Jews, thus upholding Jewish 
exclusivism and, as a natural consequence, reinforcing their Jewish 
chauvinism. Amounting to no more than 3 per cent of the US 
population, it would be impolitic of them to express openly their 
real attitudes toward non-Jews in the US. An exercise of their 
in[[flu]]ence in support of [[Israel]] as the ‘Jewish state’ compensates them 
for this constraint upon freedom of their expression. </p>
<p>Let me describe the current relations between [[Israel]] and the 
organized [[America]]n Jews. Yo’av Karni (Ha’olam Ha’ze, 
8 [[September]]) describes a new and important stage in these relations 
which began with the rise of the Rabin [[government]] to power in 
[[Israel]], but was prepared by [[America]]n sympathizers of Labor even 
earlier. Karni fully concurs with my assessment of chauvinism 
and, more importantly, of the totalitarian streak manifested by 
organized [[America]]n Jews. He quotes the words of Norman 
Podhoretz, the editor of the journal Commentary, to the effect that 
‘[[Israel]] needs criticism as much as the Sahara desert needs sand’. 
Karni treats this as descriptive of the opinion of organized US Jewry 
for years. Incidentally, Commentary is affiliated with the [[America]]n 
Jewish Committee, which in the US has the reputation of being a 
‘liberal organization’. I find it hard to imagine an [[America]]n liberal 
saying that any other state, and particularly the US, ‘needs criticism 
as much as the Sahara desert needs sand’. It is only if they belong 
to the ranks of organized Jewry and says it about [[Israel]] that their 
liberalism may remain unquestioned. But, as Karni notes, the 
same Podhoretz, first among the better-known organized Jews, 
began in [[April]] [[1993]] to oppose viciously the Rabin [[government]], to 
the point of casting doubt over whether this [[government]] ‘is loyal 
to the Jewish people’. It had obviously never crossed Podhoretz’s 
mind that [[Israel]]i [[government]]s are legally obliged to be loyal to the 
State of [[Israel]] and its laws, as [[Israel]]i ministers undertake in an oath 
they give upon taking office. In my view, there can hardly be a better 
illustration of the contrast between [[Israel]]i law, however grim are 
the discriminations it prescribes, and the expectations of Jewish 
chauvinists in the US. But why did Podhoretz change his attitudes 
about criticizing [[Israel]] in the first place? According to Karni, the 
reason was that ‘a criticism such as his, unlike that of the doves 
made against the Shamir [[government]], could not encourage the anti- 
Semites.’ While, in my view, Jews, like all other human beings, have 
an obligation to speak their minds with all candour, and without 
concerning themselves over whether a particular view of theirs 
may or may not encourage anti-Semitism, I also think that nothing 
I can imagine does actually encourage the anti-Semites more than 
the opinions of Norman Podhoretz. </p>
<p>With ‘the exception of the “Who is a Jew?” issue’, over which 
the Reform Movement shepherded a rather timid [[protest]] campaign </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS 127 </p>
<p>against the threat of enacting in [[Israel]] a law which would in effect 
define a large part of their movement as non-Jews, Karni cannot 
recall any other occasion when organized [[America]]n Jews would 
oppose any [[Israel]]i policies. He recalls how their support of the 
extremist positions of Golda Meir, Menachem Begin and Yitzhak 
Shamir surpassed in zeal all such manifestations in [[Israel]]. He finds 
it even more important to note that respectable [[America]]n organized 
Jews show no restraint in abusing not only, say, Jews who support 
the right of the Palestinians for self-determination and their state, 
but also faithful Laborites who oppose such self-evident rights. For 
evidence of this, he relies on the experience of an organization named 
Nishma [in Hebrew ‘We shall hear’] set up some years ago by 
Laborites to make their views legitimate in the eyes of the organized 
US Jews. Nothing can better illustrate the rabid militarism and total- 
itarianism of the latter than the methods resorted to by Nishma at 
Shamir’s time in order to publicize its views. For the most part it 
avoided expressing them directly. Instead, it invited [[Israel]]i colonels 
and generals in the reserves to lecture or write articles for its organ. 
One of generals in the reserves whom Nishma used extensively for 
the purpose, was the ex-commander of [[Israel]]i Military Intelligence, 
Shlomo Gazit, who advocated the toughest possible repression of 
the Palestinians unless they give in to [[Israel]]i demands; but who 
nevertheless did support the autonomy plan. Karni says that this 
recourse of Nishma to the cult of the military can be explained by 
‘the founders of Nishma’s sophisticated approach to grappling 
with the instinctive urges of US Jews’. Their last propaganda effort 
was a pamphlet displaying on its cover a photo of Rabin in the Chief 
of Staff's uniform against the background of a [[1967]] [[battle]]field. The 
caption under the photo claimed that ‘no one knows better than 
Yitzhak Rabin’ what [[Israel]] needs. It can be safely presumed that 
in [[Israel]] a photo with such a caption could only be an object of 
ridicule. </p>
<p>Karni, who is an [[Israel]]i Jew, scoffs at what he calls the ‘Yitzhak- 
is-always-right pamphlet’. He recalls that Rabin ‘is the man who 
24 years ago proposed to wipe out all [[Egypt]]ian cities located close 
to the [Suez] Canal from the earth’s surface; who 19 years ago did 
everything he might to encourage the growth of Gush Emunim; 
who twelve years ago foreclosed the chances of his own party’s return 
to power to make sure that Shimon Peres would not be Prime 
Minister; who eleven years ago supported the devastation of 
[[Lebanon]], and who five years ago virtually stupefied the friends of 
[[Israel]] in the US by ordering the [[Israel]]i army soldiers “to break the 
bones” [of Palestinian detainees]’. The enthusiasm with which 
Nishma tries to sell Rabin in the US can only arouse suspicion.’ 
Karni nevertheless notes that Rabin’s is the first [[Israel]]i [[government]] 
which is not only openly criticized but also abused amongst </p>
<p>128 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>organized [[America]]n Jews. An AIPAC leader, ‘a dealer in used 
cars in Florida’ by profession, went public by referring to [[Israel]]i 
Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin as ‘scum’, even though he 
was subsequently forced to resign as a result. Karni quotes some 
Jewish hate letters, all equipped with sender’s slips which the 
Nishma director, Tom Smerling, keeps in his office. One of them, 
while ‘returning the “Yitzhak-is-always-right pamphlet” reads: 
“Rabin in effect murders the Jews. The time has come to [[kill]] him.” 
A retired colonel of the US Army, now a lawyer in a [[New]] York 
Jewish neighbourhood, after placing on his stationery a 
pathologically abusive set of imprecations about some sponsors of 
the pamphlet, refers to Yossi Beilin as “that kind of filth”, and 
follows it by asking the Nishma directors: “Can you at all tell the 
difference between a rifle and a teaspoon?” And so on and so forth. </p>
<p>Let me here parenthetically add a personal recollection concerning 
hate letters which some [[America]]n Jews are capable of writing. In 
[[1974]], after I was invited by the [[Dutch]] Association in Support of 
Palestinian Rights for a speaking tour addressing only human rights 
issues, in Holland, I was attacked by Amnon Rubinstein (now a 
minister in the Rabin [[government]] on behalf of Meretz). He 
demanded, unsuccessfully, that I should be dismissed from my 
position at the Hebrew University for expressing my views within 
the limits of the [[Israel]]i law. After Rubinstein’s attack on me I 
received 1081 hate letters within two months. (They continued 
coming except that I ceased to count them.) Only 36 were in 
Hebrew and 3 in [[French]]: the remaining 1042 were in English. 
Almost all of their senders provided their US addresses and 
indentified themselves as Jews. They showed a complete ignorance 
of the matters at issue, confining themselves to calling me an 
enemy of [[Israel]] or of the Jews, or a ‘self-hating Jew’. All of them 
wrote, however, that they ‘were reliably informed’ that I was a 
Holocaust survivor and hence my ‘[[treason]]’ was particularly heinous. 
Some deplored that I had not been exterminated while others 
expressed a rather curious view that had I been exterminated, ‘a 
better’ or ‘more loyal’ Jew could have been saved instead of me. 
Obviously Smerling has much to learn about hate letters which 
organized US Jews are capable of writing. </p>
<p>Smerling claims that the letters he showed Karni ‘are more 
abusive than those his organization used to receive in the years he 
was criticizing the [[Israel]]i [[government]]’ under Shamir. Their 
vehemence took him by surprise since he had taken the trouble to 
publicize it widely that ‘Nishma was already supported by the 
[[[Israel]]i] [[government]]. What a delight now! Our relations with the 
[[[Israel]]i] embassy in [[Washington]] have dramatically improved. The 
embassy staff have become wonderful. They had campaigned 
against us in the Jewish community before, whereas now they are </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS 129 </p>
<p>first to appreciate our efforts to help the US understand the recent 
changes in the Middle East.’ Smerling says that he has always 
supported the right of diaspora Jews to criticize [[Israel]], but Karni 
qualifies it by observing that his attitude was dictated not by 
support of the freedom of expression as a principle, but by Jewish 
national interest: ‘When you see your Jewish brother injuring 
himself’, says Smerling, ‘you are duty-bound to help him by raising 
your voice.” Karni says that ‘the problem is that different Jews have 
different opinions about “injury to oneself”. Some believed that 
Yitzhak Shamir was injuring himself, while others claimed that he 
was doing his best to advance his own and other Jews’ cause. And 
the same goes for Rabin.’ For a long time I have believed, and I 
suspect Karni shares this belief, that the opinions of organized US 
Jews, whether they support Rabin or Shamir, are bound to remain 
anti-democratic as long as they are based solely on considerations 
of Jewish national interest. </p>
<p>As the formation of Nishma proves, the sages of the [[Israel]]i Labor 
Party anticipated long ago the troubles to be caused by the 
chauvinism of organized [[America]]n Jews. By [[July]] [[1993]] the Hebrew 
press was already quite apprehensive about the noxious impact of 
organized [[America]]n Jewry upon [[Israel]]i policies. Let me mention 
two writings in this vein. Orri Nir, then [[Haaretz]] correspondent in 
[[Washington]], reported (6 [[July]]) a frantic appeal of US Jews to ‘the 
[[Israel]]i [[government]]’ to open a campaign intended to ‘restore the 
harmony’ between that [[government]] and themselves, which was sadly 
upset of late. Otherwise, comments Nir, ‘they would continue to 
perceive Labor as an interlude between the two Likud [[government]]s.’ 
After recounting some scandals within AIPAC, like the forced 
resignation of its director, Tom Dine (which in Nir’s view was 
particularly detri[[mental]] because it was reported at length in the [[New]] 
York Times), and deploring ‘the plight in which AIPAC finds itself 
these days’, he proceeds to his main point: ‘A major part of the 
organized Jewish community in the US, including some activists 
who form the real backbone of AIPAC, have not yet accommodated 
themselves to changes in policies of the new [[[Israel]]i] [[government]]. 
After more than a year, many US Jews still disdain the Rabin 
[[government]] as deficient in displaying as much proper Jewish pride 
as they would expect. In their view this [[government]] is weak, and 
by making unnecesary concessions it betrays the sacrosanct interests 
of the Jewish people in their own patrimony. Through years of Likud 
rule the US Jews learned a sequence of Pavlovian reflexes: “Never 
withdraw, say no to any [[America]]n pressure on [[Israel]], no to any 
contacts with any [[representative]]s of the Palestinian diaspora, no 
to contacts with any Palestinian [[representative]]s from East Jerusalem, 
no to any improvement of US relations with any Arab state.” 
Official [[representative]]s of the Likud [[government]] kept telling Jewish </p>
<p>130 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>activists in the US day and night that [[Israel]]’s survival depends on 
making all these noes effective.’ Let me clarify that by saying ‘long 
years of Likud rule’, Nir also means the period of the ‘National 
Unity Government’ ([[1984]]-90), when Labor was an equal partner 
in the [[government]] and fully supported all these ‘noes’. </p>
<p>Nir approves the fact that ‘the [[Washington]]-based leadership of 
AIPAC accommodates itself to changes on the political agenda of 
the new [[Israel]]i leadership’, but, like a real Bolshevik, deplores 
AIPAC’s inability to impose its authority over ‘the 55,000 AIPAC 
activists scattered all over the US whose accommodation to those 
changes is much slower’. Unless the [[America]]n Jews so accommodate 
themselves, they can in his view damage [[Israel]] badly, when ‘an 
administration with a “Jewish connection” as firm as [[Clinton]]’s sits 
in the White House. Since [[Clinton]] feels so committed to the Jewish 
vote and even more to Jewish campaign donations, Jewish opinion 
has a great importance. A danger exists that the present US 
administration may stop heeding the voice of US Jewry as carefully 
as heretofore.’ In order to avert this danger, Nir proposes several 
measures closely resembling the Nishma methods, like sending 
‘people with authority in security affairs, plenty of generals’, to 
educate the US Jews, because their prestige in the eyes of US Jews 
remains intact, while that of the Rabin [[government]] sadly does not. </p>
<p>A deeper, but still unsatisfactory insight came from the pen of 
Meron Benvenisti writing for [[Haaretz]] (15 [[July]]). His opinions 
deserve to be quoted at length. After noting that ‘the Jewish 
[[America]]n community’ bears no less responsibility than anybody 
else for ‘the status quo’ in the [[Territories]], Benvenisti proceeds to 
describe this community’s ways of in[[flu]]encing US policies. He 
recalls that ‘when the [US] mission headed by Denis Ross came 
to Jerusalem, a Hebrew paper [Maariv] described it as “the mission 
of four Jews”, and gloated with pride while talking about the Jewish 
and even [[Israel]]i roots of all its members.’ Other papers did likewise. 
The ‘[[Israel]]i roots’ of those US diplomats comprising what went 
under the name of a ‘peace mission’ included the fact that a son 
of one of them was said to be studying in a Hesder Yeshiva, to receive 
military training there. He was also said to be a sympathizer of Gush 
Emunim and was awaiting the opportunity to serve in the [[Israel]]i 
Army in the [[Territories]]. Benvenisti’s comment is that ‘the ethnic 
origin of [[America]]n diplomats sent here to promote peace may be 
irrelevant, but it is hard to ignore the fact that manipulation of the 
peace process was entrusted by the US in the first place to [[America]]n 
Jews, and that at least one member of the State Department team 
was selected for the task because he represented the views of 
[[America]]n Jewish establishment. The tremendous in[[flu]]ence of the 
Jewish establishment upon the [[Clinton]] administration found its 
clearest manifestation in redefining the “occupied territories” as </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS 31 </p>
<p>“territories in dispute”. The Palestinians are understandably angry. 
But lest they be accused of anti-Semitism, they cannot, God forbid, 
talk about [[Clinton]]’s “Jewish connection”. After all, for its own 
purposes, the PLO wants anything as much as to keep its lines of 
communication with the Jewish community in the US open, because 
it perceives that community as so formidably powerful. Let it be 
recalled that Arafat chose in [[1988]] a delegation of [[America]]n Jews 
as a channel to publicize his decision to recognize [[Israel]], because 
he believed that only via them might he gain some legitimacy for 
himself.’ Like the rulers of Third World countries whom I 
mentioned earlier, Arafat seems to have firmly believed in the 
myth of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. </p>
<p>Benvenisti acknowledges that ‘[[Israel]] benefits from Jewish 
in[[flu]]ence’, but he also points to the resultant dangers: “The uncon- 
trollability of the [[America]]n Jewish establishment, together with its 
presumption that it represents [[Israel]]i interests “better” than [[Israel]]’s 
elected [[government]] does, should be a matter for concern because 
[[America]]n Jewish leaders tend to be more hawkish than the present 
leaders of [[Israel]] are.” Benvenisti observes that ‘their involvement 
in [[Israel]]i politics was recognized long ago as legitimate.’ He also 
discusses their increasing financial support for the [[Israel]]i parties 
and movements as a manifestation of legitimacy. Even more 
importantly, he indicates the difference between [[Israel]]i Jews and 
organized US Jewry: “The Jewish community in [[Israel]] is a sovereign 
body, its membership is determined by binding state laws and it 
bears full responsibility for its fate in every walk of life. US Jewry 
is a voluntary body, has power only over those who choose to 
accept its authority and even this power is limited in scope. Whoever 
wants to bear full responsibility should come and bear it here. Those 
who prefer to bear only a partial or marginal responsibility are free 
to choose so, provided they do not demand for themselves a status 
they do not qualify for.’ It is rather curious that after defining the 
[[America]]n Jewry as ‘a voluntary body’, Benvenisti deplores its 
‘uncontrollability’. But in Zionism such paradoxes abound. </p>
<p>It can be seen that for Benvenisti only Jewish citizens of [[Israel]] 
count as ‘the people of the state’, as it used to be said when the 
state religion was a condition for exercise of any political rights. 
Whatever their legal status, all non-Jewish [[Israel]]i citizens are in 
his eyes entitled to no more than toleration, such as accorded to 
the Jews before their emancipation. Needless to say, had anyone 
applied Benvenisti’s implicit assumptions about the [[Israel]]i non- 
Jews to the Jews in the US, he would be accused of anti-Semitism. 
A conclusion to be drawn from Benvenisti’s attitude is that the 
in[[flu]]ence of organized US Jews in [[Israel]] poses an insoluble problem 
as long as [[Israel]] remains ‘a Jewish state’. No palliative measures 
can have any effect. That in[[flu]]ence is going to last no matter how </p>
<p>ie 9 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>many [[Israel]]i generals are sent on propaganda missions to please 
US Jewish hawks. </p>
<p>The financial support of the US Jews 1s not distributed equitably 
among [[Israel]]i political parties. The nght-wing Tzomet (‘Junction’) 
party, for example, does not solicit money abroad as a matter of 
principle. By paring down its expenses and relying on volunteer 
labour, it manages to sustain itself only with the allowances that 
each party with seats in the Knesset has the legal right to receive. 
By contrast, Likud, the religious parties, Gush Emunim and other 
extremist groups depend primarily on financial support from Jews 
living outside [[Israel]]. To all appearances, most of that support 
comes from English-speaking countries, an exception being the 
Shass party which gets support from [[France]] and Morocco. The 
Hebrew press reported that after Netanyahu was elected as Likud 
leader, he used to spend most of his weekends on fund-raising tours 
in the US and other English-speaking countries. But however 
organizations under his direct control benefit from such tours, 
Likud gets less such money than the more extreme organizations. 
For most weathy right-wing diaspora-Jews, Likud is now not 
extremist enough, as a result of which they now prefer to contribute 
to other recipients. </p>
<p>Let me quote from a report by the Ferusalem Post [[New]] York 
correspondent Sue Fishkoff (1 [[August]]), the gist of which also 
appeared in the Hebrew press. Although her report reads as if 
borrowed from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, there 1s no reason 
to suspect its accuracy: ‘Convinced that mainstream [[America]]n 
Jewish organizations, notably the Conference of [[President]]s and 
AIPAC, have lost their effectiveness, an international group of 
powerful, af[[flu]]ent Jews has created a new organization dedicated 
to preserving [[Israel]]’s security and territorial integrity.’ It is named 
the World Committee for [[Israel]] (WCI) and ‘headquartered in 
[[New]] York’. Fishkoff named some of the richest Jews of the world 
as affiliated with the WCI, including the leaders of the Syrian, 
[[Egypt]]ian and Moroccan Jewish communities in the US, as well as 
some of the wealthiest Jews in [[Britain]] and other English-speaking 
countries. </p>
<p>One of the WCI’s founders, Dr Manfred Lehmann of Miami, 
told Fishkoff that ‘we are an af[[flu]]ent group. We are not looking 
for donations and we won’t be doing fundraising.’ He added that 
‘the organization was founded by Sephardic [that is, ‘Oriental’} and 
Ashkenazi leaders, marking the first time that both diaspora 
communities have joined forces to make a single, united statement 
to [[Israel]]: “We are saying that the Rabin [[government]] must 
understand that any decision about the Land of [[Israel]] must have 
the approval of Jews in the Diaspora. Shimon Peres, Shulamit 
Aloni, Yossi Sarid - they are falling all over each other in their rush </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS V53 </p>
<p>to offer Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and Gaza to the Arabs. But 
who has given them the legal, moral and historic right to give away 
Jewish land?’ Indeed, in terms of authentic Zionism, as also 
reflected in the [[Israel]]i ‘Law of Return’, Lehmann is certainly right. 
After all, the Zionist doctrine postulates that ‘the Land of [[Israel]]’ 
belongs to all the Jews, not only to those who happen to live on it. 
But, for a considerable time Likud has failed to stand by these 
sacrosanct principles, whether in deed or even in words. I cannot 
recall in the last 16 years a single speech by Begin, Shamir or 
Netanyahu that would reaffirm that ‘any decision about the Land 
of [[Israel]] must have the approval of Jews in the Diaspora’. </p>
<p>The WCI may thus be said to be a guardian of ideological 
traditions which in the early [[1970]]s were accepted unquestioningly 
both in [[Israel]] and in the Diaspora. While the bulk of [[Israel]]is have 
explicitly or tacitly transcended those traditions under the impact 
of the military stalemate of the [[1973]] war and the Lebanese debacle, 
many diaspora Jews have stood by them faithfully to this very day. 
The WCI may be therefore expected to donate money only to those 
[[Israel]]i groups with views according with those dominant in the early 
[[1970]]s, that is, to religious settlers and assorted Messianists, but 
not to Likud. It may be mentioned that the Shass Party’s spiritual 
leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, ‘has given his stamp of approval to 
the WCI. He offered a taped statement to them, indicating his 
growing dismay at the territorial concessions envisaged by the 
Rabin [[government]], and suggesting that Shass will not agree to them.’ </p>
<p>The publication of the Oslo Accord sparked a long-anticipated 
crisis in the Rabin [[government]]’s relations with the majority of 
organized US Jews. This was why on Friday, 10 [[September]], the 
Hebrew press devoted a huge amount of space to discuss the 
reactions of the US Jews to the news that the [[Israel]]i [[government]] 
violated all the taboos it had upheld until a short while earlier. For 
reasons of space, let me confine myself to a discussion of three 
articles published by [[Haaretz]] on that day. Emmanuel Sivan, a 
Hebrew University professor and an expert on Islam, who is on 
good terms with the [[Israel]]i establishment, begins his article by 
recounting two stories from his life which clearly bother him, but 
which in his view are descriptive of ‘the deep strain’ existing in the 
relations between [[Israel]] and organized US Jews. Let me quote these 
stories verbatim: ‘In mid-[[August]] I received a letter from Mr G. L. 
Greenberg of Seattle, [[Washington]] State, who apparently is a major 
donor to the institution in which I am employed. He enclosed a 
clipping from the [[New]] York Times quoting some criticism of my 
authorship of certain aspects of the “Accountability Operation”. 
“Tt is deplorable”, wrote Mr Greenberg, “that the Hebrew University 
is either unwilling or unable to inculcate its employees in an amount 
of pride and respect for the State of [[Israel]], sufficient to make them </p>
<p>134 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>realize that anything they may say might damage [[Israel]]. I have 
contributed to the Hebrew University for years, but from now I 
no longer will give it even ten cents to be used for a salary of 
someone petulant enough to besmirch [[Israel]]’s good name. I hope 
you will understand the reason of my decision to discontinue 
donations to your employer.” </p>
<p>‘In the process of replying to Mr Greenberg, I realized that the 
right wing [of the US Jewish community] has no monopoly in 
resorting to such methods. Years ago, Michael Lerner, the editor 
of a Jewish bimonthly journal [7zkkun] published in San Francisco, 
commissioned from me an article analysing some developments in 
the [[Israel]]i-Arab conflict. "wo weeks after I delivered my work, the 
editor phoned to tell me that the article was OK, provided it were 
supplemented by two or three paragraphs upbraiding the Shamir 
[[government]]’s response to the described developments. I told him 
I disagreed because the article was analytical and already contained 
parts critical enough. “But your critism is too tame”, argued the 
editor. “It must be more direct and emphatic. Do you know what 
we might do? You will add just one really juicy paragraph, and I 
will double your fee. Can we call it a deal?” I hung up the receiver.’ </p>
<p>Digressing for a moment from Sivan’s story, I have two 
observations. The first is personal: I have the honour to be the first 
Hebrew University professor whose ‘besmirchings’ have provoked 
a spate of letters of [[protest]] from organized US Jews to the university, 
even more hostile in their tone than the letter quoted by Sivan. Many 
such letters, or copies of letters written to the university, or vice 
versa, were also addressed directly to me. Unlike Sivan, I refused 
to answer any of them. I left the job to the university authorities, 
who persevered honourably to stand by my right (within the 
limitations imposed by [[Israel]]i law) to speak my mind, regardless 
of the financial losses incurred in their defence of this right of their 
employees. When letters from English-speaking countries [[protest]]ing 
my continuing employment by the Hebrew University rose to an 
avalanche, the University thoughtfully prepared a form letter to send 
to all such [[protest]]ers in reply. There was only one instance when 
I reacted personally. It was when some Jewish [[chemistry]] professors 
in the US, headed by the Nobel prize winner H. C. Brown, in 
addition to objecting to my employment out of their chauvinism, 
cast doubt upon my professional competence. I then asked some 
West German organic chemists not only to speak up in defence of 
my rights, but also to send letters to the Hebrew University and 
to H. C. Brown at[[testing]] to my qualifications for my job. The 
intended effect was achieved: the Jewish professors of [[chemistry]] 
in the US were thus silenced. </p>
<p>Sivan is undoubtedly right when he says that ‘liberals’ among 
organized US Jews have totalitarian leanings no less strong than </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS Moo </p>
<p>overt chauvinists. In this, my second observation, I would go even 
further than Sivan and say that, much as I abhor the journal 
Commentary, I abhor Tikkun even more for its sanctimonious 
hypocrisy and for its methodical mendacity about everything that 
concerns Judaism. I prefer to deal with the overt chauvinism of a 
Podhoretz who is at least intelligible, than with ‘the politics of 
meaning’ of a Lerner devoid of any meaning and therefore more 
dangerous. Sivan is right in pointing to an attitude shared by nearly 
the entire organized US Jewish community which most [[Israel]]i 
Jews find increasingly intolerable: namely to the former’s conviction 
that they can buy the latter, or even that they have bought them 
already. Sivan perceives the financial benefits derived by [[Israel]] from 
the donations of US Jews as ‘a necessary evil’, acceptable ‘during 
the first years of [[Israel]]’s existence or during the crisis in the 
aftermath of [[1973]]. But by now the volume of the [[United]] Jewish 
Appeal (UJA) collections 1s already smaller, not to mention the fact 
that about 60 per cent of its revenues are destined for local [Jewish] 
organizations.’ According to news items sporadically appearing in 
the Hebrew press, far less than the remaining 40 per cent ever 
reaches [[Israel]]. It is difficult to trace what happens to those funds. 
Sivan hints that ‘the sums which do reach [[Israel]] should not be 
downplayed because for the most part they are used to finance the 
fund-starved sectors of education, [[welfare]] and [[health]], with the effect 
that such [[[Israel]]i] budget increments can sometimes determine the 
survival of an institution. Still, after the [[America]]n guarantees, the 
value of the Appeal’s funding is declining steadily.’ This is at best 
a half-truth. Since [[1975]], [[Israel]]i [[government]]s, especially those of 
Labor, starve the sectors of education (particularly higher 
education), [[welfare]] and [[health]] on purpose, one of their motives 
being to maintain the discrimination of Palestinians who are [[Israel]]i 
citizens in those sectors. Only Jewish citizens (with a token addition 
of some Druzes) can benefit from UJA money. When the financing 
of education, [[welfare]] and [[health]] is to some extent entrusted to the 
UJA, the standard-of-living gap between Jews and Arabs in [[Israel]] 
can be preserved. The ‘Jewish state’ can thus remain ‘Jewish’, or 
at least Zionist. But it is true that the funds which [[Israel]] has been 
obtaining from the UJA have since long been paltry when compared 
to the amounts received from the federal budget of the US. The 
role of the UJA is political: it helps AIPAC and other bodies of 
organized US Jewry to force the 97 per cent of the non-Jewish US 
citizens to contribute to [[Israel]] indirectly through the medium of 
their federal taxes. This method is more efficient than relying on 
the goodwill of the organized half of 3 per cent of the Jewish 
citizens for voluntary donations. </p>
<p>Sivan expects peace to be immensely profitable to [[Israel]] in 
financial terms. Accordingly, he thinks that once peace is reached, </p>
<p>136 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[Israel]] could and should dispense with such methods of securing 
its revenues. This idea has nothing to do with discrimination 
against non-Jews, which he does not even mention. If anything, 
his thinking reflects the emotions of the new power elite in [[Israel]]. 
He strongly resents the humiliation, when ‘in order to get money 
from the Appeal, we need to display to them our wounds, our defects 
and the poorest among us. For that purpose, our most heroic 
generals need to recount stories of their deeds under personal 
danger, because otherwise the hearts of [[America]]n Jewish millionaires 
won’t be warmed enough. And the same goes when they address 
[Jewish] provincial audiences. We can only hope that those 
humiliations will be no more. The abolition of the UJA should be 
one of the dividends of peace.’ </p>
<p>Sivan waxes even more emotional about the conflict between the 
tenets of ‘quasi-familial’ (his term) Jewish unity and those of the 
free-market economy. (The latter is the only ideology which now 
begins to compete with Zionism in the hearts of the new [[Israel]]i 
power elite.) He considers ‘egoism, advantage seeking and treating 
other human beings as objects’ as preferential values, to be adhered 
to in economy and politics, but not in family relations. The latter 
need to be subordinated to the opposing values of ‘affiliation, 
affinity and unconditional obligations’. To Sivan’s sorrow, however, 
the financial relation between [[Israel]] and organized US Jewry rests 
upon the exploitation of emotions which perceive world Jewry as 
one big family. This is, according to him, acceptable only in 
situations of extreme emergency, and should now be dispensed with, 
‘especially when donors of Mr Greenberg from Seattle’s ilk perceive 
their donations as a means to become our owners’. Sivan supports 
emotion-based relations of US Jews with [[Israel]]i Jews, but not with 
the State of [[Israel]]. He proposes that groups of [[America]]n Jews 
contribute to specific institutions or for specific aims, provided they 
recognize that ‘the existence of the State of [[Israel]] is a precondition 
of their pursuit of Jewish secular way of life’. In my view, Sivan’s 
proposals are an instance of having your cake and eating it too. 
According to his cherished principles of free-market economics, 
human relations can be based either on pristine egoism or on its 
absence, but the two cannot be blended together. Relations which 
in his understanding ‘cannot revolve around dollars alone’, are by 
definition tainted by blending emotions with dollars, in dissonance 
with the principles which he cherishes. </p>
<p>So much about Sivan. I proceed to discussing two other articles 
published by [[Haaretz]] on 10 [[September]], one by its [[Washington]] 
correspondent Akiva Eldar and the other by the [[New]] York 
correspondent, Shlomo Shamir. They both deal with developments 
among US Jews in the immediate aftermath of the publication of 
the Oslo Accord. They both say that it was easy to persuade the </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS 137 </p>
<p>leaders of the organized Jews to toe the new [[Israel]]i line, but that 
their rank and file were less amenable to such persuasions, thereby 
posing the risk that in spite of all precautions against it, they may 
yet be able to publicize their views far and wide, thus revealing to 
Gentiles all their hostility toward the Rabin [[government]]. Shamir 
informs us how Sharon, who happened to be in [[New]] York when 
the Oslo agreement news was published, urged his Jewish friends 
to organize [[protest]] demonstrations before the [[Israel]]i consulate in 
[[New]] York and the embassy in [[Washington]]. His suggestion evoked 
utter shock and was rejected. It was in my view the same kind of 
shock that would have been felt if somebody suggested to some 
members of the [[America]]n Communist Party to organize a 
demonstration before the USSR’s embassy in [[protest]] against the 
memorable Khrushchev [[1956]] speech. Shamir also reports with 
satisfaction that ‘when some rabbis from the Association of 
Orthodox Rabbis proposed to name the coming Sabbath “a Sabbath 
of [[protest]]” and to make all the Association’s rabbis sermonize 
against the accord, in[[flu]]ential rabbis managed to prevent that 
proposal from even being discussed.’ He also says that ‘leading 
Jewish publicists’ were afraid to publish their views in opposition 
of the accord in the [[America]]n media. To illustrate this information, 
he has a story, clearly originating from behind the scenes of the [[New]] 
York Times. After that paper published ‘some reactions of prominent 
Jewish leaders enthusiastically supporting the Accord’, it wanted 
to publish a Jewish voice with opposite views. Among Jews otherwise 
acceptable to the 72mes, it could find only Ruth Wisse, a professor 
of Yiddish literature whose views are more extremist than of Gush 
Emunim. Sensing that Wisse was not [[representative]] enough, the 
newspaper turned to Norman Podhoretz. </p>
<p>Eldar provides more information. His article contains an interview 
with Gail Pressberg, the current president of Friends of Peace 
Now in the US, an organization which has clearly become charged 
with controlling the organized US Jewish community on behalf of 
the [[Clinton]] administration and the Rabin [[government]]: “Last week 
Pressberg was asked by the White House to draft a list of in[[flu]]ential 
leaders of Jewish organizations to be invited to the ceremony of 
signing the Accord. The idea was to exploit their in[[flu]]ence in 
favour of the peace process.’ Other Hebrew papers reported that 
the number of Jewish invitees amounted to over one thousand, out 
of the total of 3,300. Eldar writes that ‘the sympathizers of Friends 
of Peace Now are now holding many key positions in both regimes’, 
that is, the [[America]]n and the [[Israel]]i. Pressberg told Eldar that 
donations to her organization have soared, ‘reaching the magnitudes 
received in the good old days when we supported Begin after 
Camp David’. Parallel with this flow of money and the spectacle 
of Jewish leaders rapidly changing sides, the advancement of </p>
<p>138 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Pressberg to what could only be described as the post of White 
House superintendent of Jewish affairs has been achieved. She said 
with glee that ‘many Jewish leaders are leaving the organizations 
which used to support Likud in order to join us.’ But there are no 
indications that a comparable process of changing sides is occurring 
among the members of those organizations. On the contrary, other 
Hebrew papers report that many Likud supporters are now 
switching to more extremist organizations. Also, the White House’s 
stand has failed to move the US Jewish masses in the direction of 
Peace Now. Eldar reports that ‘a demonstration of support 
organized by Peace Now on the evening of 8 [[September]] in front 
of the [[Israel]]i embassy attracted no more than about two dozen rather 
bewildered participants.’ </p>
<p>In spite of her ‘present exultant feelings’, Pressberg shares Eldar’s 
assessment of the situation. She told him [[Israel]] can expect dangers 
on the part of organized US Jewry: “The greatest danger is that the 
[[[Israel]]i] extreme right may be capable of soliciting huge amounts 
of money from the [[America]]n Jewish community.’ To avert this 
danger she proposes the same remedy as Nishma’s, namely to 
invite [[Israel]]i generals or other ‘major figures’ to speak in [[America]]n 
synagogues. She is sure that ‘the majority of ordinary Jews will stop 
posing problems after hearing correct explanations from [[[Israel]]i] 
military figures and others.’ Eldar asked Pressberg to comment 
about another danger: Jewish columnists in in[[flu]]ential papers, 
‘such as Rosenthal’ [in the [[New]] York Times] who oppose the 
Accord. Pressberg agreed that ‘they are very dangerous.’ </p>
<p>The most important part of the interview, which I am going to 
quote im extenso, concerned Peace Now’s manipulation of the 
media, aimed at in[[flu]]encing the White House. Eldar: ‘Suppose 
[[President]] [[Clinton]], for whom Jewish support has its weight, comes 
eventually to the conclusion that the articles by [Jewish] opponents 
of the Accord do represent the authentic position of the Jewish 
community. Might it not deter him from persisting in supporting 
the deal? What are you doing to persuade the administration that 
its support for the Accord is not going to make the Jewish supporters 
of [[Clinton]] and his campaign contributors change their minds?’ 
Pressberg: “Che [[President]] knows that the responsible community 
leadership has published a declaration of support for the Accord. 
But we also run a campaign to let thousands of our supporters cable 
the White House or address it otherwise. We are using all our 
in[[flu]]ence to make the papers accept for publication lots of articles 
authored by both [[Israel]]is and [[America]]ns who support the [[Israel]]i 
[[government]]. We provide instructions to anyone willing to 
subsequently write letters to the editor.’ It can be presumed that 
Peace Now in[[flu]]ences the papers and to all appearances even more 
the television, not only in order to publish what it wants to be </p>
<p>ISRAEL AND THE ORGANIZED AMERICAN JEWS 139 </p>
<p>published, but also in order to conceal what it wants to be concealed 
from public knowledge. This is, after all, what all US Jewish 
organizations have done for years, with considerable success. </p>
<p>Two conclusions can, in my view, be drawn from the 
developments described in this report. The bulk of the organized 
US Jewish community is totalitarian, chauvinistic and militaristic 
in its views. This fact remains unnoticed by other [[America]]ns due 
to its control of the media, but 1s apparent to some [[Israel]]i Jews. As 
long as organized US Jewry remained united, its control over the 
media and its political power remained unchallenged. But right now, 
there have appeared clear indications of its vulnerability to splits 
in its ranks, in addition to a silent [[protest]] of many Jews who may 
not be ready to rebel outwardly, but who already refuse to support 
actively the [[Israel]]i [[government]] and its policies. Parallel with that, 
there have appeared indications of an unease within the [[Israel]]i power 
elite. These two new developments may yet lead to a major change 
in [[Israel]]i policies. Concretely, [[Israel]] may yet try to rely more on 
its own strength and less on the in[[flu]]ence of US Jewry upon 
[[America]]n politics. </p>
<p>12 </p>
<p>The Pro-[[Israel]]i Lobby in the US 
and the Inman Affair 
11 [[February]] [[1994]] </p>
<p>After Admiral Inman’s announcement that he would not serve as 
[[Clinton]]’s defence Secretary, the Hebrew press devoted a fair 
amount of space to the implications of that affair for [[Israel]]. The 
first responses expressed [[Israel]]i satisfaction. A good example is the 
comment of Yediot Ahronot’s [[Washington]]’s correspondent Haim 
Shibi, who wrote that ‘every [[Israel]]i in [[Washington]] could but sigh 
with relief at the news of Inman’s resignation’ (20 [[January]] [[1994]]). 
However, after a few days, deeper analyses of that event appeared, 
disclosing its implications for [[Israel]], in particular in so far as its 
[[nuclear]] policies were concerned. Some articles on that subject, 
however, also discussed [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence upon the US exerted via 
the Jewish lobby in that country. Most important were the articles 
by Amir Oren (Davar, 28 [[January]]) and Yoav Karni, published the 
same day in Shishi. Oren’s article stressed the incompatibility 
between Inman’s past policy recommendations and [[Israel]]i political 
aims, especially in regard to [[nuclear]] matters. Both authors, usually 
mildly critical of [[Israel]]’s policies but never of its [[nuclear]] build-up, 
were very hostile toward Inman. Furthermore, Oren discussed in 
depth Pollard and [[Israel]]i espionage in the US, as having something 
to do with [[Israel]]i objections to Inman as a person and to his policy 
recommendations. </p>
<p>At about the same time the Hebrew press reported on the 
contents of the recently published book Critical Mass by William 
FE. Burrows and Robert Windrem. Information contained in that 
book about [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power was assessed by Hebrew press 
commentators as accurate, even though its publication was 
attributed to the viewpoint of the US officials known for their 
objections to [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power and contingent policies. At the 
same time knowledgeable Hebrew press commentators discussed 
[[Israel]]i threats against [[Iran]], including those of using [[nuclear]] weapons 
against that country. After reviewing the Inman affair as perceived 
by the Hebrew press, I will discuss other articles discussing [[Israel]]i 
[[nuclear]] policies and the points where they clash with the avowed 
(but seldom acually pursued) [[nuclear]] policies of the US. </p>
<p>140 </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR 141 </p>
<p>Let me first express my view on the actual scope of ‘Jewish 
in[[flu]]ence in the US’ and its capability of bending US policies so 
as to suit [[Israel]]i interests, also in matters [[nuclear]]. Some of the best 
informed and most widely read Hebrew press commentators (who 
are quoted in this book), perceive the scale of that in[[flu]]ence as 
hardly limited by anything and as extending upon large areas of 
the world. One of the most prestigious of [[Israel]]i commentators, 
Yoel Markus ([[Haaretz]], 31 [[December]] [[1993]]) recently spoke of the 
‘courtship’ of [[Israel]] by various states, concluding that ‘this courtship 
has nothing to do with the peace process: its only reason is the 
entire world’s recognition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion 
as true. When the US is being ruled by an administration as 
favourably disposed to [[Israel]] as the present one, conviction spreads 
in every state that the only way to [[America]]’s purse leads via [[Israel]]. 
It is as if this accursed book were not written by an anti-Semite, 
but by a clever and far-sighted Jew.’ I myself would perceive the 
scope of that in[[flu]]ence as more restricted. Although it is obviously 
very considerable, and although [[Israel]] is doing its best to sustain 
and augment it, actual [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence upon the US still falls far 
short of the mythology of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Its 
scope cannot be measured exactly, but it can be estimated, albeit 
with the help of guesswork. True, any knowledge, no matter how 
approximate, of the extent of Jewish in[[flu]]ence upon the US policies 
is hard to obtain. The topic is taboo in the US (although not in 
[[Israel]]), with all major [[America]]n Jewish organizations exerting 
themselves to maintain the taboo, often with the help of 
philosemitic Christians, who delude themselves that by gagging 
discussion of Jewish affairs, and in particular about Jewish 
chauvinism and exclusivism, they ‘atone’ for the Holocaust. 
Reliable knowledge about [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence, as about any other taboo 
subject, can be arrived at only after the interdict is lifted and the 
subject is freely discussed. </p>
<p>Oren mentions a number of reasons why [[Israel]] loathed and 
feared Inman. The main reason he names is [[Israel]]i expectation that 
if Inman would be appointed the US Defense Secretary, he would 
be able to put into effect independent [[America]]n inspections of [[Israel]]i 
[[nuclear]] armaments and their production process in Dimona. It 
needs to be recalled that by virtue of a secret agreement with the 
US reached during the first year of John F. [[Kennedy]]’s term of office 
as president, the US to this day receives only such information about 
[[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power as [[Israel]] is pleased to convey. After the [[Bay]] 
of Pigs fiasco [[Kennedy]] needed the support of the ‘Jewish lobby’ 
and in order to get it, he sanctioned this curious agreement. Oren 
opens his article by drawing two horror scenarios which he regards 
as perfectly possible if US policies are ever in[[flu]]enced by Inman 
or somebody with similar views. In the first scenario a hypothetical </p>
<p>142 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>US Defense Secretary is, ‘in [[December]] [[1994]]’, gloating to his 
subordinates, that ‘after the US succeeded to force [[North]] [[[[Korea]]]] 
to limit its [[nuclear]] programme, and after its first success in 
negotiations with [[Iran]] concerning the same matter, “we must now 
concentrate all our attention on India, [[Pakistan]] and [[Israel]]. Since 
our dispute with the [[CIA]] is not yet resolved, I decided to instruct 
the Defense Intelligence Agency to begin gathering independent 
information about advances in [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] armaments, so that 
after subjecting the data to our analysis, we would provide the 
[[President]] with our well-informed assessment of the situation”. 
‘Then the former Admiral cleaned his glasses, laughing sardonically. 
“Although the person responsible for the conclusive Intelligence 
evaluation is their friend, we can at least show the [[Israel]]is that we 
have eyes and ears.’ It is fair to assume that had a US paper 
published such a caricature of a hypothetical [[Israel]]i Jewish defence 
minister, it would be accused, not without reason, of anti-Semitism. 
It is virtually certain, however, that no press commentator in the 
US will accuse Oren of being anti-Gentile. </p>
<p>The second horror scenario anticipates an [[America]]n attempt to 
use a [[spy]] aircraft to photograph the [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] installations in 
Dimona ‘in [[January]] [[1995]]’ and [[Israel]]i hesitations over whether to 
bring it down. If [[Israel]] does bring down the plane, it will be sure 
to antagonize the ‘Gentiles’ [Goyim], even worse than in the Liberty 
affair of [[1967]], when [[Israel]] [[bomb]]ed the US warship Liberty inflicting 
heavy casualties. The scenarios lead Oren to the conclusion that, 
due to Inman’s resignation, ‘the ghastly anticipations are not going 
to materialize’. The first scenario can no longer take place, because 
“by the coming [[December]] or at any other time the post of the US 
Defense Secretary can no more be held by the intelligence expert 
former Admiral Bobby Ray Inman.’ More significantly, at the end 
of his article Oren says that if the US administration ever ‘weighs 
the utility of Dimona against the utility of [[America]]n support of any 
other states, the [[Israel]]i [[government]] is sure to call up a general 
mobilization of all its friends in [[Washington]]. [[Israel]] will be pleased 
at such time about each of its enemies no longer in position to 
in[[flu]]ence the administration or the [[Congress]] but also feel sorry about 
each Pollard and each “Liberty” [affair] for which it has ever been 
responsible. It will not regret Inman’s absence, in spite of the fears 
that the latter may voice his views in the US media.’ </p>
<p>Let me proceed to Karni. He says that ‘Inman’s candidacy for 
the post of the Defense Secretary has raised the gravest 
apprehensions of the [[Israel]]is and the Jews.’ It is reasonable to 
suppose that when saying ‘the Jews’ Karni really means only those 
‘[[America]]n Jews’ whom I defined as ‘organized’. It is also reasonable 
to suppose that the organized [[America]]n Jews did not remain idle 
when they had their ‘gravest apprehensions’, but did something </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR _ 143 </p>
<p>concrete to relieve them, which means that they did play a role in 
events leading to Inman’s resignation. When discussing the role 
of the [[New]] York Times columnist, William Safire, whom Inman 
named his main enemy, Karni says: ‘Safire is but one in a group 
of Jewish columnists and publishers who wield enormous in[[flu]]ence 
over the [[America]]n media, and who are prepared to automatically 
defend every [[Israel]]i policy measure, except for the peace initiative 
of the Rabin [[government]] which they were quick to condemn and 
to consign to the grave.’ </p>
<p>Both Oren and Karni are nevertheless under no illusion that 
Inman is the only ‘enemy’ left in the US Defense and Intelligence 
establishment. Karni provides a whole list of US Defense Secretaries 
whom he defines as mischievously hostile to [[Israel]], among whom 
he names Caspar Weinberger as the most pernicious. He even 
attempts to draw a ‘sociological profile’ of an [[America]]n Gentile 
who in his view is likely to become an ‘enemy’. Apparently Karni 
is a unaware that in drawing such ‘profiles’ he follows in the 
footsteps of anti-Semites (and other xenophobes) who also used 
to draw ‘profiles’ of Jews with the same purpose in their minds. It 
can be nevertheless presumed that his ‘profile’ originates with 
sources close to [[Israel]]i Intelligence. It reads as follows: “The 
personal profile of Inman is from the [[Israel]]i point of view 
unpromising. He is a [[white]] Anglo-Saxon Protestant, graduate of 
the best universities, a member of the elite clubs. He represents 
the kind of personality more similar to George [[Bush]] or James 
Baker than to Ronald [[Reagan]].’ </p>
<p>Oren is more subtle than Karni in his description of Inman’s 
‘personality’: ‘In spite of the absence’of Inman in the future, 
[[Washington]] (and Texas even more) is still saturated with people 
born in provincial towns during the hard times. Such people tend 
to be motivated to rise up via the military services, most often via 
service in the Navy. Inman is merely one of such characters. Ross 
Perot is another, and one of their allies [he doesn’t say who] is 
similar. Inman and Perot are highly intelligent and sly, but they 
have inferiority feelings due to their failure to achieve anything of 
significance. Whenever an individual of this type becomes a 
candidate for the US presidency or for a position which in the scale 
of authority almost approaches the presidency, such as the position 
of Defense Secretary, the problem becomes not just an domestic 
[[America]]n one, but a global one. When an incumbent of either post 
perceives himself as a victim of an [[Israel]]i or Jewish plot, [[Israel]] cannot 
treat it as a joke.’ </p>
<p>We can see how certain [[America]]ns are a priori defined by [[Israel]] 
(and by organized [[America]]n Jews) as ‘undesirable’, or worse, at 
least when they occupy positions of authority. For a comparison, 
it is worthwhile to quote Oren about the biography of a ‘desirable’ </p>
<p>144 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[America]]n, namely William Safire: ‘William Safire loyally served an 
anti-Semitic president, [[Nixon]], because he was free to be most 
impressed by [[Israel]]i military might, long before he became a [[New]] 
York Times columnist. Safire’s best friend, the [[CIA]] Chief, William 
Casey, was at the beginning of [[Reagan]]’s administration forced to 
accept Inman as his Deputy ... Fortunately, Safire didn’t regard 
his [[New]] York Times columns as equivalent to a monastery. An [[Israel]]i 
who toward the end of the [[1970]]s served in [[Washington]] and was 
then year after year invited to Safire’s home for a meal ending the 
Yom Kippur fast, was surprised to discover that the number of 
Safire’s guests, all Jewish with high standing either in politics or 
Washigton’s media, was increasing each year. There was even talk 
that no one not born of a Jewish mother or converted to Judaism 
according to Halacha would be admitted to Safire’s table, even 
though it meant that Henry Kissinger, if invited, would have to 
choose between his wife [who is a Gentile] and Safire. Inman 
knew that Safire always worked in tandem with Casey and that 
Casey always worked in tandem with [[Israel]]. Casey’s relatively 
authoritative biography informs us that in the spring of [[1981]] he 
met Yitzhak Hofi, then Mossad Chief, for the purpose of making 
a deal. Casey undertook to provide [[[Israel]]] with satellite-derived 
information about the Iraqi [[nuclear]] reactor, in return for Hofi’s 
undertaking to restrain AIPAC in its opposition against the sale of 
AWACS planes to [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]]. Some time later Safire vociferously 
denounced the restrictions imposed by Inman on automatic 
transmission [to [[Israel]]] of [[America]]n intelligence information about 
Iraq and [[Libya]].’ Incidentally, the terms of the deal between Casey 
and Hofi conclusively prove that AIPAC (and presumably other 
[[America]]n Jewish organizations as well) operates under the command 
of Mossad, and that it could be used by the [[Israel]]i [[government]] just 
as it uses Mossad. </p>
<p>Yediot Ahronot’s correspondents Tzadok Yehezkeli and Danny 
Sadeh (30 [[January]]), write in their review of the previously mentioned 
book Critical Mass that ‘[[Israel]] solicits money from wealthy Jews from 
all over the world for financing its [[nuclear]] weapons programs. 
This fundraising drive is directed by a committee comprised of 30 
Jewish millionaires.’ As usual, Jewish exclusivism and chauvinism 
are here exploited by [[Israel]] as a major tool of its policies. The impact 
of this practice can be a matter for discussion, but denials of its 
very existence, let alone denials of the right to discuss this matter, 
are in my view not only intellectually and morally offensive, but 
also preclude any informed inquiry into both Middle [[Eastern]] and 
[[America]]n politics. </p>
<p>Karni clarifies that the mentioned restrictions imposed by Inman 
applied only to automatic sharing of all information. [[Israel]] could 
still make specific requests for information, however, which could </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR 145 </p>
<p>be either approved or rejected, but which seem to have in most cases 
been approved. What apparently irked Safire and his Jewish pals, 
was the very fact that [[Israel]] had to request information from the 
US. Karni nevertheless says that information about what was going 
on ‘within the radius of 250 miles from the [[Israel]]i borders continued 
to be automatically shared with [[Israel]]’. According to him, a problem 
appeared ‘in [[1982]] when Yasser Arafat moved his residence from 
Beirut to Tunis, thus leaving the area within which all information 
from the [[America]]n [satellite] cameras was to be instantly passed 
on to [[Israel]]’. This was the reason for [[Israel]]’s displeasure with the 
250-mile limitation. In all probability, this limitation was eventually 
rectified. Still, as long as it existed, the 250-mile radius meant that 
information was automatically conveyed to [[Israel]] about goings on 
in all of Jordan, hefty chunks of Syria, [[Lebanon]], Iraq and [[Egypt]], 
and part of [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]]. Nevertheless, countries like [[Libya]] or 
[[Pakistan]] lay outside the area in question, which worried the [[Israel]]is, 
especially since automatic transmission of intelligence from outside 
of the radius was discontinued after the [[Israel]]is destroyed the Iraqi 
[[nuclear]] reactor. Karni informs us, I believe accurately, that ‘what 
particularly worried Jerusalem was that Inman didn’t convey to [[Israel]] 
any information about the [[nuclear]] projects of [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]].’ 
In my view the anti-Iraqi posture of [[Israel]] was a momentary 
deviation from the consistent pattern of seeking to maintain good 
relations with Saddam Hussein, in recognition that [[Israel]]’s main 
enemies have been first [[Iran]] and, next in line, [[Pakistan]], for the 
simple reason that both states are bigger and stronger than Iraq. 
Let me again quote in this context Tzadok Yehezkeli’s and 
Danny Sadeh’s review of Critical Mass in Yediot Ahronot 
(30 [[January]] [[1994]]). ‘They write that ‘[[Israel]] is ever ready to launch 
its [[nuclear]] [[missile]]s on 60 to 80 targets. Those targets include sites 
in the Gulf, the capitals of all Arab states, some [[nuclear]] bases on 
the territory of the former USSR and some sites in [[Pakistan]].’ (I 
am convinced this is accurate.) It means that [[Israel]] must very 
much want to obtain US satellite information about the targeted 
area, a not-so-negligible part of the earth’s surface. ‘The existence 
of so formidable a [[nuclear]] power in [[Israel]]’s hands cannot be 
convincingly attributed to its own [[research]] and development efforts 
nor to its role as a tool of [[America]]n policies. On the contrary, a 
[[nuclear]] power of that magnitude must be presumed to run counter 
to US imperial interests. It is also doubtful, to say the least, if [[Israel]] 
by itself ever had the money for constructing [[nuclear]] power of this 
size, even when US financial help is taken into consideration. Nor 
can [[nuclear]] power of this extent be explained away by the usual 
excuse of “guarding against threats to [[Israel]]’s very existence’ or by 
nauseating misuse of the memories of the Holocaust. The only 
plausible explanation of the extent of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power is that </p>
<p>146 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>[[Israel]] acquired it with at least some help of its ‘Jewish friends’ in 
the US and of some Jewish millionaires all over the world. 
Yehezkeli’s and Sadeh’s information about ‘the [[nuclear]] bases on 
the territory of the former USSR’ fits well with what Geoffrey 
Aronson, relying on US State Department sources, reveals about 
the Pollard affair in the Christian [[Science]] Monitor (27 [[January]]). He 
writes that according to ‘unanimous response’ from these sources, 
what Pollard had betrayed were ‘this country’s most important 
secrets’, namely ‘information relating to the US targeting of [[Soviet]] 
[[nuclear]] and military installations and the capabilities and defences 
of these sites’. This seems in accord with [[Israel]]’s global aspirations 
based on the extent of its [[nuclear]] power. Aronson’s sources say that 
much of the intelligence passed on by Pollard ‘was unusable by the 
[[Israel]]is except as bargaining chips and leverage against the [[United]] 
[[States]] and other countries’ interests’. In view of this fact Aronson 
conjectures that Pollard’s intelligence was used by [[Israel]] for deals 
with Moscow consisting of ‘trading [[nuclear]] secrets for [[Soviet]] Jews’. </p>
<p>Oren, who is a firm believer in Jewish in[[flu]]ence on US policies 
(even if perhaps not as firm as Markus), provides some examples 
of its exercise that have to do with the person of Inman. Here, I 
quote him verbatim, interspersing the quotes with my own 
comments. ‘Although Inman behaved with fairness and propriety 
towards Mossad and the Central Gathering Unit of Military 
Intelligence [of the [[Israel]]i Army], the shadow of the Liberty affair 
could always be sensed in the background. In the early [[1960]]s, Inman 
had been a [[research]] and operation officer serving on behalf of 
[US] Navy Intelligence in the NSA [National Security Agency], 
which ran Liberty and its sister ships. The NSA was subordinated 
to the Pentagon and not to the [[CIA]]. It dealt with tactical intelligence, 
including the trailing of [[Soviet]] ships, but not with strategic 
intelligence. The US Navy has never reconciled itself to the closure 
of the Liberty file after its destruction by the [[Israel]]i Air Force, and 
has always perceived the timing of the [[Israel]]i attack as evidence 
that [[Israel]] did it deliberately, in order to conceal from the [[America]]ns 
its decision to [[conquer]] the Golan Heights before a cease-fire could 
be put into effect through an [[America]]n—[[Soviet]] agreement.’ (This 
appraisal of [[Israel]]i intentions strikes me as perfectly accurate.) 
“True, Rabin, the then [[[Israel]]i] Chief of Staff, learned about this 
decision only after Dayan suddenly changed his mind from opposing 
to supporting the plan of that conquest, and issued orders to this 
effect directly to the Commander of the [[North]]ern Command, 
passing Rabin by. But Inman also recalls how three years later [in 
[[1970]]] Dayan didn’t hesitate to threaten the [[America]]ns openly and 
directly, telling them that if they ever dared to send a photo-taking 
aircraft over the [[Israel]]i bank of the Suez Canal, he was going to 
order to down it.’ Let me comment, first, that I find Oren’s </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR_ 147 </p>
<p>information’s perfectly accurate, and second, that I find it most 
significant that the US, possibly due to the in[[flu]]ence of Safire and 
Kissinger over [[Nixon]], then gave in to Dayan’s threats so supinely. </p>
<p>‘During the Liberty affair and thereafter, including the tme when 
the [[CIA]] ship Pueblo was captured (but not destroyed) by the [[North]] 
[[[[Korea]]]]ns, Inman was chief of the Department of Current Intelligence 
of the Navy’s [[Pacific]] Command. He learned a lot there, enough 
to disbelieve in coincidences or at least in their frequent occurrence. 
This is why, while serving as a NSA chief during Carter’s 
administration he refused to attribute to coincidence two other facts 
he then learned about. He first learned that the Carter 
administration had agreed under pressure to the appointment of 
Colonel Shlomo Inbar as the [[Israel]]i military attaché in [[Washington]]. 
That Inbar — previously the head of [[Research]] and Development 
in the [[[Israel]]i] Security System, then Commander of 
Communication Division [of the [[Israel]]i Army] and finally 
Commander of the Central Gathering Unit of the Military 
Intelligence [of the [[Israel]]i Army] — told directly his [[America]]n 
visitors that providing [[Israel]] with any secret information it requests 
would lie in the best [[America]]n interest because “anything you 
would refuse to share with us we will steal anyway.” </p>
<p>“The pig-headed [[America]]ns didn’t then grasp the [[Israel]]i sense 
of humour. They understood it only when a Navy Intelligence 
employee, Jonathan Pollard, was caught red-handed while passing 
on to [[Israel]] precisely this kind of information which Inman had 
decided to withhold from [[Israel]]. Nevertheless, some [[America]]ns 
interpreted the link [between Inbar’s words and Pollard’s deeds] 
as purely coincidental. And interpreted likewise as coincidental were 
the links connecting Rafi Eitan, then the chief of the Office for 
Scientific Contacts (LEKEM), who employed Pollard, with the 
[[[Israel]]i] Defence Minister, Ariel Sharon, who had appointed Eitan 
and who rushed to [[Washington]] in order to complain against Inman 
and his orders.’ </p>
<p>Karni recounts two more curious coincidences. The first is that 
among those to whom Sharon ‘complained’ against Inman was no 
one else but Safire. The second is that shortly afterwards 
‘Lieutenant-Colonel Aviam Selah was sent to the US for a lecture 
tour sponsored by the [[United]] Jewish Appeal and the [[Israel]]i Bonds 
organization. He turned out to be one of the pilots who destroyed 
the Iraqi [[nuclear]] reactor, relying on [[America]]n satellite information 
in the process. Selah once delivered a lecture to a group of stock- 
market brokers, all of them Jewish, in the office of one such broker, 
William Stern. Stern was very impressed by Selah, in a way in which 
the [[America]]n Jews typically tend to be impressed by [[Israel]]is who 
posture as war heroes and have photogenic cheeks. He was so 
impressed by Selah, that he rushed in great excitement to tell his </p>
<p>148 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>cousin all about him. That cousin happened to be a junior officer 
in the US Naval Intelligence and his name was Jonathan Pollard. 
Pollard shared the excitement and asked to meet Selah.’ Karni is 
biased in favour of Pollard and willing to twist evidence accordingly, 
due to which the sequel of his story brings nothing new. Nevertheless 
his story of a quickly arranged meeting between an [[Israel]]i lieutenant- 
colonel on a busy tour and an [[America]]n Jew working for US 
Intelligence bears in my view all the marks of truth. </p>
<p>Oren continues: ‘But Eitan ran Pollard with the explicit approval 
of four Defence Ministers and Prime Ministers, concretcly Arens, 
Rabin, Shamir and Peres. The details of this affair must be known, 
among others, to General Danny Yatom [now the Commander of 
the Central Command], who at that time served as military secretary 
to Arens and Rabin and who in that capacity was drafting the 
minutes of their conversations with Eitan. All such individuals 
know how to use the rhetoric of the importance of the US support » 
for [[Israel]], but they also know what to do in order to risk the loss 
of that support. Of course, owing only to another fortunate 
coincidence, the [secret [[Israel]]i] Inquiry Committee headed by 
{the former Mossad Chief] Tzvi Tzur and Yehoshua Rotenstreich 
found it possible to absolve all [[[Israel]]i] politicians of all responsibility 
for the Pollard affair and to put all the blame on LEKEM 
functionaries.’ Tzur was subsequently appointed as the Chairman 
of the Directors of the [[[Israel]]i] ‘Aviation Industries’, owned by the 
[[Israel]]i [[government]], and considered one of the most desirable 
[[government]] jobs in [[Israel]]. Rotenstreich already then held the post 
of the Chairman of the Censorship Committee, where he always 
was siding with the [[government]]. Rafi Eitan was not forgotten 
either. After helping sell Iraqi oil all over the world, he now oversees 
[[Israel]]i [[trade]] with [[Cuba]] and some of its agricultural development. </p>
<p>This story shows that [[Israel]], by skilfully exploiting its in[[flu]]ence 
within the US, manages to steer very far from becoming an 
[[America]]n satellite. Sure, the fact that [[Israel]] has its value for 
[[America]]n imperial interests also contributes to the same effect. This 
explains why, in spite of [[Israel]]’s financial, and now lesser political 
dependence on the US, [[Israel]] can often afford to provoke the US 
in a manner that may be crude and arrogant. Oren understands 
that [[Israel]]’s relative independence should not be undermined by 
crass displays of [[Israel]]’s brashness but only because avoidance of 
such displays helps [[Israel]] maintain its independence more effectively. 
In his view, which, as will be shown below, is shared by the entire 
[[Israel]]i establishment, the extent of [[Israel]]i independence can be 
tested, indeed has already been demonstrated above: that if the US 
administration ever ‘weighs the utility of Dimona as against the 
utility of [[America]]n support of any other states, the [[Israel]]i 
[[government]] is sure to call up a general mobilization of all its friends </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR _ 149 </p>
<p>in [[Washington]]’. The two crucial areas which [[Israel]] wants to 
maintain its independence from the US are its [[nuclear]] power and 
its in[[flu]]ence within the US itself. </p>
<p>The Inman affair and the publication of Critical Mass has brought 
the issue of [[Israel]]i’s relative independence from the US into sharp 
focus. It would be instructive to review some past manifestations 
of this independence together with their impact upon regional 
politics. Let me begin with some quotations from what the Hebrew 
press wrote about [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power in [[1991]]. Even then, boasts 
about [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] power could be seen as a response to [[Bush]]’s 
attempts to somehow limit [[Israel]]’s options in [[nuclear]], and perhaps 
also [[missile]], development. That response was described by the chief 
political commentator of [[Haaretz]] Uzi Benziman (31 [[May]] [[1992]]). 
He attributed it, though, not straight to Shamir or Arens, but only 
to their ‘underlings’, who ‘vented all their wrath at [[[Bush]]’s] plan 
without even bothering to get acquainted with all its details ... 
[They] saw [[Bush]]’s initiative as dangerous, amateurish, reflecting 
[[[Bush]]’s] arrogance ... Laborites such as Rabin, were unanimous 
in unconditionally rejecting [[Bush]]’s initiative, differing at best over 
how their rejection should be phrased.’ Benziman explains it: “The 
fierceness with which the entire power elite of the State of [[Israel]] 
reacted to the new ideas of [[Bush]] cannot come as a surprise. [[Bush]] 
hit our softest spot. When he proposes to freeze the proliferation 
of weapons he is interpreted as trying to deprive us of our soul, of 
the last asset we have. When he proposes to prohibit installation 
of long-range ground-to-ground [[missile]]s he is perceived as 
threatening our very survival.’ </p>
<p>Out of the important articles published in mid-[[October]] [[1991]] in 
[[Haaretz]] let me quote from those by Ze’ev Shiff (15 [[October]]) and 
the [[nuclear]] expert Avner Yaniv (16 [[October]]). Shiff, admitting that 
he reflected the official [[Israel]]i viewpoint wrote: “Whoever believes 
that [[Israel]] ever will sign the [UN] Convention prohibiting the 
proliferation of [[nuclear]] weapons ... is daydreaming. There are no 
misgivings in [[Israel]] about the need to reject this convention with 
all firmness.’ Yaniv substantiated the same conclusion by recounting 
the [[history]] of [[nuclear]] negotiations between the US and [[Israel]] from 
[[Kennedy]]’s time. He wrote, ‘in so far as this subject matter is 
concerned the past is quite a reliable guide to prospects for the 
future.’ According to Yaniv, ‘[[Kennedy]] was no less determined to 
prevent [[Israel]] from acquiring [[nuclear]] weapons than [[Bush]] is now.’ 
But “both [[Kennedy]] and Johnson failed in all they wanted, to the 
point that in the end they found themselves, against their will 
helping lay foundations for the subsequent close and amicable 
cooperation between the US and [[Israel]].’ He concluded that as long 
as [[Israel]] follows the precedents of the past, the US, far from </p>
<p>150 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>imposing any [[nuclear]] limitations on [[Israel]], would be in the end 
bound to contribute to [[Israel]]’s [[nuclear]] strength. </p>
<p>[[Israel]]’s insistence on the independent use of its [[nuclear]] weapons 
can be seen as the foundation on which [[Israel]]i grand strategy rests. 
The Oslo process changed nothing in this respect. Yoel Markus 
([[Haaretz]], 1 [[February]] [[1994]]) quotes Rabin’s first open reference to 
the putative [[Iran]]ian threat ‘made on 20 [[January]] [[1993]], while 
answering in the Knesset a question of MK Efraim Sneh (Labor). 
Rabin said that “we are following with concern the [[Iran]]ian 
[[nuclear]]ization and attempts to develop long-range ground-to- 
ground [[missile]]s.” His operational conclusion was that “we should 
precipitate the peace process in order to create an international 
machinery capable of responding to the [[Iran]]ian threat.”’ Markus 
disapproves of what he interprets as [[Israel]]i threats to use [[Israel]]i 
[[nuclear]] weapons against [[Iran]] in the relatively near future. Obviously 
relying on the best [[Israel]]i Army and Intelligence sources rather than 
on his own understanding, he provides an estimate of ‘[[Iran]]ian 
political aims [which] can be assumed to be ordered in importance 
as follows: A. Systematic conquest of oilfields. B. Under[[mining]] the 
present Arab regimes in [[Egypt]], [[Lebanon]], Iraq, [[Algeria]], [[Saudi]] 
[[Arabia]], Jordan and of course, the subjugation of the Palestinian 
entity to itself with help of Hamas. [The absence of the Syrian regime 
from this list is conspicuous.] C. The ultimate unification of 900 
million Muslims of the world under its command, with a single 
[[theology]] imposed on all of them.’ The difference between Markus’ 
views and the policies [[Israel]] is now said by him to pursue is timing. 
In his view the time to fight [[Iran]] will come if and when the above- 
estimated [[Iran]]ian aims are achieved: ‘In the long range, if [[Iran]] ever 
comes close to fulfilment of its dreams to turn all Islamic states, 
from [[Algeria]] to Turkestan, into a single Khomeinistic [[empire]], 
[[Israel]] would have good reasons to feel keenly concerned.’ </p>
<p>There are good reasons for assuming that for the [[Israel]]i Security 
System in general and for Shimon Peres in particular the ‘peace 
process’ is conceived of primarily as a tool to promote such mad 
strategies. The best recent summary of Peres’ policies has been 
provided by Aluf Ben writing in [[Haaretz]] (23 [[January]] [[1994]]). 
According to Ben, Peres agrees with ‘the heads of the Security 
System’ that ‘at present there exist two main threats to [[Israel]]i and 
Middle [[Eastern]] security’, namely ‘funda[[mental]]ist Islam and [[nuclear]] 
weaponry, in particular when held by [[Iran]]. But’, continues Ben, 
‘unlike the heads of the Security System, Peres does not want 
[[Israel]] to rely on the defensive, deterrent and offensive power of the 
[[Israel]]i Army alone, but wants to overhaul the [[[Israel]]i] concept of 
security’. His idea is that in the coming era of peace ‘[[Israel]] should 
be recognized as a legitimate player on the Middle [[Eastern]] 
playground’, in the position to exploit its legitimacy for the sake </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR | 151 </p>
<p>of promoting its grand strategy. According to Peres, in the Middle 
East there is no room for [[nuclear]] deterrence as it was used in the 
Cold [[War]], because ‘the enemies of [[Israel]] are not as rational as the 
rulers of the US and the USSR were, to the point that under the 
in[[flu]]ence of the Ayatollahs they may court disasters for the entire 
world.’ Let me recall in this context how in [[1984]] Peres saved the 
career of that paragon of rationality, Ariel Sharon, and how he was 
sustaining for years that ultra-rational movement, the Gush 
Emunim. And he still maintains fairly good relations with both. </p>
<p>According to Ben, Peres proposes that [[Israel]] establishes ‘a 
regional [[alliance]] system which will operate as a single political 
entity’, and which ‘will be powerful’. But ‘in contrast to [[NATO]], 
which limited its aims to defending its members against the external 
[[Soviet]] threat, Peres’ regional [[alliance]] system is meant to defend 
the countries of the Middle East from themselves, that is from the 
internal seeds of destruction, instability, religious and ethnic zealotry 
and the economic competition between its constituent parts.’ 
Although Ben tends to agree with Peres’ ideas, still, for the sake 
of clarity he comments: ‘Only one question Peres let remain 
unanswered: what will be the future of the [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] arsenal 
which Peres has so often boasted he helped create?’ In my view 
there are many questions which ‘Peres let remain unanswered’, for 
example the obvious question about the geographical boundaries 
of the area to be included in his ‘regional [[alliance]] system’. Obviously, 
the states listed by Markus as threatened by [[Iran]] are planned to 
be included. But what about Syria and [[Iran]], even after the ‘regional 
[[alliance]] system’ settles its accounts with them? And what about 
[[Pakistan]] on which, as mentioned above, [[Israel]]’s [[nuclear]] [[missile]]s 
are now targeted? It would be instructive to recall in this context 
that toward the end of [[1981]], Sharon made a public speech in 
which he cheerfully proposed that [[Israel]]’s in[[flu]]ence extend ‘from 
Mauritania to Afghanistan’. When so defined, the area may include 
[[Pakistan]]. In my view it can be reliably assumed that strategic aims 
which Sharon defined in so brutal a manner are the same as those 
pursued by Peres though the ‘peace process’. </p>
<p>Ben doesn’t try to answer the question about ‘the future of the 
[[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] arsenal’. He says that in Peres’ view ‘the “fog” 
enveloping the [[[Israel]]i] [[nuclear]] plans is a factor strengthening 
[[Israel]]i deterrence.’ In my view there cannot be any doubt that plans 
for ‘Peres’ regional [[alliance]] system’ rest on the [[Israel]]i monopoly 
of [[nuclear]] weapons and has two aims, one offensive and the other 
defensive. The former is to fight [[Iran]] and its allies such as Syria, 
unless it passes over to the pro-[[Israel]]i camp. The latter is to preserve 
the status quo in the Middle East by protecting all regimes not 
labeled ‘funda[[mental]]ist’. Incidentally, since according to Peres, 
[[Israel]]’s strategic aim is to maintain the existing regimes intact, ‘the </p>
<p>152 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>abolition of the economic competition’ as envisaged by Peres can 
be presumed to be effected not through the mechanism of 
referendums and [[parliament]]ary elections, but through a diktat, in 
all probability backed by the [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] monopoly. </p>
<p>The plans of Peres imply a considerable [[Israel]]i emancipation from 
its dependence on the US (and marginally on [[Europe]]). In that 
respect they differ from the views of ‘the heads of the Security 
System’ and from [[Israel]]i foreign relations as pursued to date. Some 
implications of Peres’ views and of his disagreements with the 
[[Israel]]i commanders are clarified in another article by Amir Oren 
(Davar, 4 [[February]] [[1994]]). Oren claims that “by choosing the 
channel of Oslo’ as top priority for the pursuit of [[Israel]]i policies 
‘Peres gambled by staking a lot on the PLO’ as ‘against staking on 
the US’, because he expected the PLO to help establish the ‘regional 
[[alliance]] system’. According to Oren, this explains Peres’ indifference 
to the progress of peace negotiations with Syria, in defiance of US 
pressures to advance them. But the order of priorities of ‘the chiefs 
of the [[[Israel]]i] Security’ is quite different. Their top priority is ‘to 
sever Syria’s connection with all too many threats [to [[Israel]]] 
originating from [[Iran]]’. Oren quotes the commander of the Air Force, 
General Budinger, who last week said that the F-15-A warplanes 
which [[Israel]] had recently obtained from the US, in addition to ‘their 
ability to fly to [[Iran]] and back without refuelling’, could also “operate 
efficiently within 50 per cent of the radius of their maximal outreach’. 
As Oren admits, this means the F-15-A warplanes ‘will be able to 
penetrate deep into Syrian territory, and cruise there for quite a 
while in search of their targets, whereas lower quality warplanes 
could at best [[bomb]] a target upon reaching it and then be forced 
to quickly return to [[Israel]]’. But, continues Oren, ‘this capability, 
though important, is still not as important as the capability of a F- 
15-A warplane to reach Tehran and rain on it [[bomb]]s which can 
improve the hearing of [[Iran]]ian decision-makers.’ The [[Israel]]i 
generals, whose views Oren can be presumed to echo also ‘rely on 
security arrangements agreed upon with Jordan more than on any 
deals which could be made with a Palestinian entity’. Their criticism 
of Peres (described by Oren in detail but omitted here) and of his 
way of negotiating with Arafat is according to Oren attributable to 
much deeper differences over strategy, such as described here. </p>
<p>The idea of a ‘regional [[alliance]] system’ implies the exclusion of 
the US from it and [[Israel]]’s supremacy within it, backed by the latter’s 
[[nuclear]] monopoly. Its avowed goal ‘to secure peace in the region’ 
resembles all too closely similar claims of the imperial powers of 
the past, made for the consumption of the gullible. This is why Peres’ 
plan can be viewed as an extreme version of [[Israel]]i imperialism. 
The nature of the relations between [[Israel]] and other states of the 
‘regional [[alliance]] system’ is described in another article by Aluf Ben </p>
<p>THE US PRO-ISRAELI LOBBY AND THE INMAN AFFAIR _ 153 </p>
<p>([[Haaretz]], 11 [[February]] [[1994]]). Ben quotes the first director of the 
[[Israel]]i Institute for Development of Weaponry [RAFAEL], Munya 
Mardoch, that ‘the moral and political meaning of [[nuclear]] weapons 
is that states which renounce their use are acquiescing to the status 
of vassal states. All those states which feel satisfied with possessing 
conventional weapons alone are fated to become vassal states.’ A 
transparent implication of that view is that by insisting on its 
[[nuclear]] monopoly, [[Israel]] aims at reducing all other Middle [[Eastern]] 
states to the status of its vassals, probably hoping for approval of 
such a state of affairs by the US. </p>
<p>Apart from the question of whether all existing Arab regimes 
would want to join ‘an [[alliance]]’ so transparently stewarded by 
[[Israel]], one can also ask about the survivability of any Arab regime 
joining that ‘[[alliance]]’. I feel unable to answer this question. I am 
concerned, however, more with a third question: whether the US 
would be pleased by a unification of the Middle East under [[Israel]]’s 
command - it could then in[[flu]]ence this unified region only via its 
in[[flu]]ence on [[Israel]]. Let me recall that through such unification, 
entailing an [[Israel]]i hegemony, [[Israel]]i financial dependence on the 
US and thereby the US’s chances to in[[flu]]ence [[Israel]] would be 
diminished. It seems also doubtful whether the US (or indeed 
[[Europe]]) would be pleased with the abolition of ‘economic 
competition’ between states under ‘an [[alliance]] system’ powerful 
enough to accomplish it. This is why Peres’ plan can only be 
interpreted as assuming that [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence upon the US, exerted 
through the medium of organized [[America]]n Jews, is sufficient to 
outweigh US imperial interests. As I mentioned above, I do 
recognize the power of organized [[America]]n Jews as quite formidable. 
But contrary to some Hebrew press commentators, I don’t believe 
that it 1s sufficient to justify that tacit assumption of Peres. The 
organized [[America]]n Jewish community may, as Oren hopes, 
succeed in protecting the independence of [[Israel]]i [[nuclear]] policies 
but I doubt if they are capable of accomplishing much more. </p>
<p>I hope I have succeeded in showing that the role of ‘organized’ 
Jews in the US in the affair of Inman’s resignation touches on the 
deepest issues of [[Israel]]i grand strategy. I also hope I make it clear 
that the Peres’ plans are in my view not only immoral and crudely 
imperialist, but also downright unrealistic, no matter how 
enthusiastic western commentators are about him. They represent 
an [[Israel]]i expansionist’s utopia. In my view the plans of Peres are 
more morally reprehensible than the plans of the [[Israel]]i Security 
System: more nauseously hypocritical, and more pregnant with more 
disastrous consequences for the entire Middle East if any attempt 
is ever made to bring them about. I consider the imperial plans of 
the [[Israel]]i generals to be at least implementable, primarily because 
they pose less of a threat to the imperial interests of the US. Still, </p>
<p>154 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>those plans are also symptomatic in that they reflect two most 
cherished [[Israel]]i ambitions: the ambition to reduce its dependence 
on the US, especially in the [[nuclear]] domain, and the ambition to 
exploit their thus enhanced independence for the pursuance of [[Israel]]i 
grand strategies. Peres’ plans articulate those two ambitions in the 
most extremist manner possible. But what is most dangerous are 
the ambitions themselves rather than any of their articulations. </p>
<p>Part V </p>
<p>OSLO AND AFTER </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>The Real Significance of the Oslo Accord 
10 [[September]] [[1993]] </p>
<p>The Oslo Accord between [[Israel]] and the PLO has to be understood 
first of all in the context of the more than 26 years of [[Israel]]i 
conquest of the [[Territories]]. This conquest can be divided into two 
periods: before and after the outbreak of the Intifada in [[December]] 
[[1987]]. From the point of view of the [[Israel]]i establishment the first 
period can be defined as ‘an easy conquest’. During this time the 
average number of soldiers and other armed forces which [[Israel]] kept 
in the [[Territories]] was small, between 10—15,000. During the heyday 
of the Intifada, in mid-[[1988]], the number of troops was 180,000. 
After the Gulf [[War]] the number of troops declined and in spring 
[[1993]] the number rose again to about 100,000. The increase in the 
number of [[Israel]]i officials in the Military and Civil Administrations 
and of Shabak agents is unknown to me, but must have been 
proportionally much greater; much of the routine work of the Civil 
Administration which before the Intifada used to be performed by 
Palestinian clerks was afterward done by soldiers. </p>
<p>Equally important are two further changes which the Intifada 
introduced and which in spite of its decline, persist and impair 
[[Israel]]’s ability to rule the [[Territories]] easily. Before the Intifada the 
single instance of resistance which swept through all Palestinian 
society in the [[Territories]] occurred in [[1969]] in [[protest]] of the arson 
of al-Aqsa mosque. All other [[[[protest]]s]] were either geographically 
or socially limited. Many of them were limited only to the Gaza 
Strip refugee camps. Calls for strikes or other forms of [[protest]] were 
not widely observed. Many villages, which [[Israel]]i authorities 
described as ‘loyal’, never participated in [[[[protest]]s]] before the 
inception of the Intifada. Although the Intifada as an active force 
has declined dramatically, a considerable demonstration of national 
unity, as seen in joint actions, persists. </p>
<p>More important is the second change which has continued since 
the inception of the Intifada, since it is more visible to the [[Israel]]i 
Jewish public. Before the Intifada [[Israel]]i Jews enjoyed full freedom 
of movement within the [[Territories]], including places such as the 
Gaza Strip refugee camps where no [[Israel]]i will venture now, except 
on the rare invitation from an activist and accompanied by </p>
<p>IF </p>
<p>158 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Palestinian guides. Stone throwing was infrequent and quite 
unknown in most villages. It is hard to recall now, but before the 
Intifada [[Israel]]i Reserve soldiers would frequently celebrate the 
end of their service in the Gaza Strip by holding a party in a 
restaurant, even in a refugee camp. Obviously, many of the effects 
of the Intifada remain and cannot be eradicated by [[Israel]]. </p>
<p>The reason for the change is that before the Intifada [[Israel]] could 
always find Palestinian collaborators who could rule the [[Territories]] 
on its behalf. When using the term ‘collaborator’ in this context, 
I do not mean a [[spy]]. I mean, on the contrary, a person who was 
publicly known as one who has good relations with the [[Israel]]i 
authorities, and who could be employed by other Palestinians to 
obtain favours for them. In return, he used his social and political 
in[[flu]]ence in [[Israel]]’s interest. The method operated best in Dayan’s 
time, from [[1967]] to [[1974]], when the ‘notables’, that is the figures 
in[[flu]]ential in Palestinian society even before the conquest, were used 
in this role. The efficiency of the method declined to some extent 
under Sharon in [[1981]]-83, who demolished the power of the 
notables and put in their place his “Village Leagues’, often composed 
of the dregs of the society. But since the start of the Intifada this 
method has proved impossible to implement. The consequence is 
that [[Israel]] had to undertake the task of ruling the Palestinians on 
every level by its own manpower. This form of direct rule is much 
less efficient, and also more corrupt and burdensome. The [[Israel]]i 
establishment wanted for quite some time to restore the old method 
of indirect rule, especially in the Gaza Strip on [[Israel]]i terms. This 
is the meaning of the Oslo Accord as [[Israel]] perceives it: the PLO, 
or rather a part of Fatah with an absolute loyalty to Yasser Arafat 
is intended to fulfil the role which the notables performed under 
Dayan and Village Leagues, under Sharon, but more efficiently. 
It will be rewarded by a lot of money, by a much greater degree of 
honour than the notables enjoyed and by some verbal concessions, 
vaguely formulated so as to lead to further stalemates in negotiations. 
Neither side to the Accord intends to realize it as it stands. </p>
<p>Therefore, in order to explain in detail the real meaning of the 
Oslo Accord, as perceived by [[Israel]] and tacitly accepted by the PLO, 
I will not quote its text, which is purposely vague on issues of 
Palestinian rights while precise on issues of what powers [[Israel]] will 
retain. Rather I will quote the interpretations of the real [[Israel]]i 
intentions made by the most knowledgeable Hebrew press 
correspondents. Their opinions clearly come from the highest 
sources in the [[government]] and were not contradicted by anyone 
in [[Israel]]. (The fact that their opinions were not mentioned by the 
self-censored Arabic press in East Jerusalem and the [[Territories]] 
appears to me equally significant.) The most important of them 
were made by the chief political correspondents of Yediot Ahronot </p>
<p>THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OSLO ACCORD 159 </p>
<p>and [[Haaretz]], Shimon Shiffer and Uzi Benziman respectively. Both 
enjoy excellent connections with Rabin and Peres and can be 
considered as reliable informants. While Yediot Ahronot is the 
Hebrew paper with the largest circulation, [[Haaretz]] is the most 
prestigious. </p>
<p>Shiffer reports from [[Washington]] (2 [[September]] [[1993]]) that ‘in 
meetings held between [[Israel]]i delegates and personalities in the PLO 
it was decided to form a joint committee, comprising Shabak and 
PLO figures. The purpose of setting a joint committee 1s to reach 
cooperation in all matters concerning domestic security in the 
Gaza Strip ... [[Israel]] and the PLO, in recognition of their present 
interest in ensuring success of the peace process, will try to prevent 
all attempts by Hamas to sabotage it, also after the autonomy is in 
force.’ Shiffer then adds on his own, so that his readers will have 
no doubt about the nature of the cooperation, that ‘most of Shabak’s 
activities take place in the [[Territories]], where it prevents sabotage 
and captures wanted Palestinians.’ It can be safely assumed that 
Shabak is already helped to a considerable extent in those activities 
by the cooperation of the PLO, or of such forces within it which 
accepted this task. </p>
<p>The real purpose of the cooperation and of the Oslo Accord itself, 
is Clearly indicated by Benziman in two articles, published on 3 and 
5 [[September]] respectively. In the first article Benziman wrote, ‘A 
tacit understanding exists between [[Israel]]is and Palestinians who 
attended the secret negotiations [in Oslo] to the effect that no 
autonomy in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip can possibly 
materialize even if the Oslo Accord mandates it. Instead of the 
autonomy as mandated by the Oslo Accord, the PLO may at once 
begin to rule over the Gaza Strip and Jericho, exercising there the 
full authority of the Civil and Military Administrations except in 
foreign affairs, and thus be freed from the need to hold any elections 
and to compete over the votes with Hamas ... In spite of the fact 
that the Accord stipulates that elections to the Autonomy Council 
are to be held in [[June]] [[1994]], it is quite likely that negotiations 
preliminary to carrying out the elections may fail. This may happen 
due to a disAccord [sic] over the Council’s authority or, even more 
likely, yust because the PLO will prefer to have no elections. Instead 
of holding elections, the PLO is expected to make all the efforts 
to obtain in the remainder of the [[Territories]] the same authority it 
will have in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The expected result is that 
PLO jurisdiction in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as determined by 
the Oslo Accord, will gradually diminish the authority of the 
Military Administration over the Palestinians in the remainder of 
the West Bank. [[Israel]] may agree to this, provided the PLO 
jurisdiction does not ever extend to Jewish settlements, the Security 
Zone and Jerusalem. During the five years after signing the Oslo </p>
<p>160 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Accord, the interim Accord which defines the status of the PLO 
in the Gaza Strip and Jericho (the authority to administer domestic 
affairs, including the police) may yet turn into a permanent 
arrangement for the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip.’ </p>
<p>While the above quoted passages occurred in an article whose 
first part was devoted to the praise of Rabin and Peres for this 
achievement, in his second article of 5 [[September]], Benziman 
repeated the quoted argument independently of it. He first 
compared the deception involved on the [[Israel]]i side in the Oslo 
Accord, to the deception involved in the [[1982]] invasion of [[Lebanon]] 
and recorded that even the defenders of the Oslo Accord agree that 
it was achieved by the use of deceit. Benziman then admits that 
the distinction made by the defenders of the Oslo Accord, namely, 
that the first deception was intended to enlarge the war while the 
second to bring peace, is not really valid, since ‘the opponents of 
the [[1993]] peace can claim that the [[1982]] war was intended to bring 
lasting peace ... [While] negotiations in Oslo may bring about a 
result causing many victims in the future.’ Benziman’s opinion is 
that deceptions are permitted in a democracy, but he is uneasy with 
the deception underlying the Oslo Accord. His predictions deserve 
to be extensively quoted: “There is something in the peace of [[1993]] 
which disturbs also those who support it entirely, and which 
concerns the tacit meanings involved in it. There are indications 
that the Accord is built on a tacit assumption that it will never be 
carried into effect. Even now, before it was signed it is clear to its 
initiators (at least to the [[Israel]]i side) that the probability within nine 
months, of establishing the Autonomy Council to be elected by the 
Palestinians living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is very small. </p>
<p>“Even today all knowledgeable people in Jerusalem talk about a 
system of rule in which the interim settlement will be based on an 
increase of the authority which the PLO will be granted in the Gaza 
[Strip] and Jericho over the entire West Bank, not as a result of 
any elections but by an [[Israel]]i decree. The elections, if any, will 
come after this decree. Thus, the regime in the [[Territories]] will not 
be an elected autonomy but a PLO-appointed administration. If 
this happens, [[Israel]] supports a process which is intended to prevent 
any chance to form by its side a democratic Palestinian entity (or 
a state), and establishes instead an autocratic form of regime, 
similar to those existing in the Arab states. This is in spite of the 
[[Israel]]i claims that the democratization of its Arab neighbours is a 
basic condition for [[Israel]]i-Arab peace-making and for [[Israel]]’s 
readiness to make sacrifices for its sake. The probability that it is 
this autocratic regime which will be the outcome of Oslo Accord 
(and it was not I who invented this outcome) is the logical conclusion 
from the gap existing between the text of the many paragraphs in 
the Accord and the ability to realize the aims formulated in them. </p>
<p>THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OSLO ACCORD 161 </p>
<p>Those gaps will be expressed in difficulties in carrying out the Accord 
and also in other issues (the permanent Accord, for example). 
When this estimate is made by those who formulated the Accord, 
the question of whether it is based on deception is valid.’ </p>
<p>Let me first discuss the sanctimonious acceptance by Benziman 
of the official thesis that [[Israel]] is interested in a democratization 
of Arab societies. In my view it is just one of those sacrifices which 
I suppose an [[Israel]]i correspondent of his standing must make from 
time to time to appease his high-placed informants. (It reminds me 
of Voltaire attending a Mass occasionally for the same reason.) The 
easily ascertained fact is that [[Israel]] (and the Zionist movement) 
vigorously oppose democratization of Arab societies, and are 
mortally afraid of such a process. The more undemocratic, 
unpopular and corrupt an Arab regime, group or leader is, the more 
likely it is that [[Israel]] will either ally itself with it or support it. This 
could easily be seen during the period of the intense [[Israel]]i 
involvement in Lebanese affairs. In this policy [[Israel]] enjoys the full 
support of the US, whose customary policy is to oppose democracy 
in the Middle East. There are several reasons for following this 
policy. The most important is that the [[Israel]]i establishment knows 
that an Arab democracy will be much stronger than any Arab 
autocratic regime, even if such a regime happens to be temporarily 
popular. This is also true of the Palestinians. When the Intifada 
was more democratic it was also stronger. Its strength declined when 
its democratic character waned. It can be assumed that the reason 
why [[Israel]] is trying to prevent formation of ‘a democratic Palestinian 
entity’ and ‘will try to establish instead an autocratic form of 
regime’, as Benziman says, is because democracy will strengthen 
the Palestinians while [[Israel]] wants to keep them weak. </p>
<p>In addition to the greater social strength of an Arab democracy 
of which [[Israel]] is afraid, it should be recalled that an Arab democratic 
state will be able to form a much more efficient army than ‘an 
autocratic form of regime’. One reason for the weakness in numbers 
and training of all Arab armies is that dictatorship is always afraid 
of its own people. It therefore either does not arm them or, as in 
Iraq, it forms two armies, a big, badly trained, army augmented 
by well-paid and well-armed but small ‘guard units’. (The situation 
in this respect in [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] is rather similar.) The ignominious 
Iraqi military defeat in the Gulf [[War]] was due, first of all, to the 
dictatorial nature of the Iraqi regime. It may be safely assumed that 
the US opposition to the democratization of Arab states is also due 
primarily to the fact that it wants to keep them weak. </p>
<p>While a basic [[Israel]]i opposition to the democratization of Arab 
societies is common to all Zionist parties, it has been and is still, 
strongest among the Zionist ‘left’, that is the Labor Party and the 
groups to its left. The Zionist right wing, now represented mainly </p>
<p>162 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>by Likud, is basically uninterested in Arabs. It wants to keep the 
Arabs outside the Land of [[Israel]] behind the ‘iron wall’ of [[Israel]]i 
power (as Jabotinsky expressed it in the mid-[[1920]]s); those within 
the Land of [[Israel]] should be quiet and apathetic. In contrast, the 
‘left’ wants to ‘cultivate’ (to use its own expression) Arabs who will 
support [[Israel]]i policies. ‘Cultivation’ of pro-[[Israel]]i Arabs involves 
a greater degree of manipulation of Arab society and requires 
therefore stronger opposition to its democratization than a policy 
of simple domination and exploitation. During the period in which 
Labor was ‘in charge of Arab affairs’ (until [[1977]], [[1984]]—90 and since 
[[1992]]), ithas invariably supported the most feudal elements in Arab 
society and shown enmity to all progressive Arab groups, for 
example, to Palestinian feminists. This was the principle applied 
by Rabin as Defence Minister in [[1984]]-90 when he ‘cultivated’ 
Hamas. This is why Rabin and his henchmen consistently praise 
Mubarak for not allowing any democracy in [[Egypt]], and for ruling 
the country by emergency regulations. A few months ago Rabin 
said that [[Egypt]] is actually superior to [[Israel]] in this respect, citing 
this example: when new roads are being constructed in [[Israel]] 
people may appeal against them on the grounds of environ[[mental]] 
damage, even up to the Supreme Court, ‘while in [[Egypt]] Mubarak 
Just goes ahead and does not allow any appeals to courts’. There 
is NO reason to suppose that Rabin has now changed his approach. 
It can be assumed that his present ‘cultivation’ of Arafat is based 
on a similar approach. </p>
<p>The explanation of this crucial point, namely that Palestinians 
are to be given only strictly limited power in order to use it on [[Israel]]’s 
behalf is important in order to sway the [[Israel]]i Jewish public in favour 
of the Accord. For this reason, Rabin took good care to often 
reiterate this point. Let me quote one of his explanations, expressed 
with his customary vulgarity. After attacking Likud (Yediot Ahronot, 
7 [[September]]), he stated that ‘the four crucial issues around which 
negotiations with the Palestinians had revolved are: united 
Jerusalem, the fate of the settlements, the redeployment of the [[Israel]]i 
Army and the enforcement of domestic security in the Gaza Strip.’ 
He then boasted of his victories regarding all of them: “The entire 
united Jerusalem will be outside the autonomy. We ourselves 
obtained this concession from the Palestinians — from those with 
whom one should make such deals — without any [[America]]n 
promises, as in the Camp David Accords. Jewish settlements will 
be placed under an exclusive [[Israel]]i jurisdiction; the Autonomy 
Council will have no authority over them. The forces of the [[Israel]]i 
Army will be redeployed on locations determined only by us, unlike 
in the Camp David Accords which mandated a withdrawal of the 
[[Israel]]i Army forces. In the Accord we reached we didn’t consent 
to use the formula “withdrawal of [[Israel]]i Army forces” except </p>
<p>THE REAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OSLO ACCORD — 163 </p>
<p>when it applied to the Gaza Strip. In application to all other places 
the only term used is “redeployment”.’ </p>
<p>‘Discussing the issue of “Gaza [Strip] and Jericho first”, Rabin 
said: “I prefer the Palestinians to cope with the problem of enforcing 
order in the Gaza [Strip]. The Palestinians will be better at it than 
we were, because they will allow no appeals to the Supreme Court 
and will prevent the [[[Israel]]i] Association for Civil Rights from 
criticizing the conditions there by denying it access to the area. They 
will rule there by their own methods, freeing — and this is most 
important — the [[Israel]]i soldiers from having to do what they will 
do. All Gaza Strip settlements will remain where they are. The [[Israel]]i 
Army will remain in the Gaza Strip to defend them, and to guard 
all confrontation lines. It will also control the Jordan River end to 
end, and all the bridges on it”.’ It 1s quite clear that the most 
important point for Rabin is that Arafat’s faction in the PLO will 
become, or already 1s, a part of Shabak in order to perform its work 
better than [[Israel]] can by itself. (The main point is that the PLO is 
expected to be more [[immune]] to criticism than [[Israel]]. The parallel 
with the methods employed by the US in countries dependent on 
it, such as E] Salvador or Guatemala, in which the worst kinds of 
oppression are entrusted to local forces, is inescapable. </p>
<p>But if Arafat and his henchmen really hope that in recompense 
for doing efficiently the job which Rabin assigned to them they will 
get the same formal recognition as the rulers of El Salvador or of 
similar countries do, they are deluding themselves and their people. 
On this point, as on [[Israel]]i intentions in general, one can trust the 
countless declarations of Rabin, Peres and other [[Israel]]i figures of 
lesser importance, to the effect that [[Israel]] will never allow a 
formation of a Palestinian state, but only of ‘an entity’ which will 
lack all outward signs of [[sovereignty]]. Rabin had boasted of his 
superiority to Begin in his respect: while Begin allowed the 
Autonomy Council to sit in Bethlehem, close to Jerusalem and to 
other centres of Palestinian population, Rabin insisted on moving 
the Council to Jericho, the smallest and the most backward of all 
Palestinian towns. The express condition that ‘the Palestinian 
police will not have powers to detain any [[Israel]]i citizen’ in any part 
of the autonomy will remain as a visible sign of the inferiority of 
the autonomy’s powers compared with those of a nominally 
sovereign state. The police of El Salvador or even Antigua have 
the power, which they use in cases of [[America]]n drug users or 
drunken drivers, to detain US citizens. Arafat’s police will not 
have such powers. As Uzi Benziman put it in [[Haaretz]] (3 [[September]]), 
‘if Arafat wants to call the resulting entity “a state” it is his own 
business’, but it will not be a state. He may not be prevented from 
using stationery headed by empty titles, and people of the autonomy 
may be allowed to call him ‘His Excellency’, but he will not receive </p>
<p>164 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>the formal recognition granted to a [[President]] of Panama or of 
Antigua in his relations with [[Israel]]. </p>
<p>Another advantage which [[Israel]] will get from the Oslo Accord 
is lucidly explained by Danny Rubinstein in [[Haaretz]] (8 [[September]]). 
He points to the fact that under the present conditions the [[Israel]]i 
authorities are responsible, at least formally, for the living conditions 
and [[welfare]] of the [[Territories]]’ population. They have to worry about 
the increase in population which 1s ‘one of the greatest in the 
world’, and has increased even more because of ‘the in[[flu]]ence of 
the Intifada and the recent closure, which limit the freedom of 
movement of the inhabitants’. Once the [[Territories]] were separated 
from [[Israel]] such issues will not concern it. In Rubinstein’s view — 
with which I concur — the separation had already occurred with 
the imposition of closure, which can be assumed to continue under 
the autonomy: ‘Of course, [[Israel]] should make all effort to procure 
maximum international aid to flow to the Gaza Strip and other 
autonomous areas, So as to eradicate [[poverty]], unemployment and 
despondency. Otherwise, unrest will be inevitable, with outbursts 
bound to affect [[Israel]]’s security adversely.’ This is why [[Israel]] is 
prepared to allow some of the ‘Palestinians wishing to settle in the 
autonomous territories rather than in any other Arab country’ to 
do so, since ‘their problems will be theirs alone: to be solved by 
themselves or by the Palestinian Council to be set in the [[Territories]].’ 
The deeper intention of the Accord is to create an apartheid regime 
in which the Autonomy Council in the [[Territories]] will in effect 
relieve [[Israel]] from any duties towards the population. The efficiency 
of this apartheid regime will be assured by the PLO, on the one 
hand, and by the international financial aid which will be given it, 
on the other. </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>Analysis of [[Israel]]i Policies: ‘The Priority 
of the Ideological Factor 
12 [[May]] [[1995]] </p>
<p>At the time of this writing it can be seen that the [[Israel]]i [[government]] 
did nothing to make the majority of the Palestinians in the [[Territories]] 
support the peace process, although it could have obtained their 
support without sacrificing any major imperial [[Israel]]i interests. 
Commentators, including some well-intentioned ones, are wringing 
their hands imploring Rabin to refrain from taking another 
provocative step, for example, the further confiscation of land in 
East Jerusalem as decided on 30 [[April]] [[1995]]. Those commentators 
fail to perceive that Rabin’s policies have an internal logic and 
consistency based on the consensus of Labor Zionism as formed 
already in the [[1920]]s. It can be concluded that the analysis and 
prediction of those policies are very easy to make on the assumption 
that they constitute an application of the Zionist ideology which 
tends to override pragmatic considerations. The apparent exceptions 
to this rule, for example [[Israel]]i withdrawals from formerly [[conquer]]ed 
territories, are also explicable in terms of ideological factors, in this 
instance in terms of the loss of Jewish lives in unsuccessful or 
inconclusive wars and of the wish to avoid further losses of 
Jewish lives. </p>
<p>For instance, as pointed out by Tanya Reinhart in Yedior Ahronot 
(1 [[May]] [[1995]]), in all Rabin’s interviews to the Hebrew press 
published on the Passover Eve, 14 [[April]], he reiterated his ideological 
commitment to the principle that only the Jews ‘have the right over 
the entire Land of [[Israel]]’. Rabin didn’t bother to specify the exact 
borders of the Land in question: he only admitted that ‘it is also 
inhabited by two million Palestinians’ who constitute ‘a problem’ 
which only the Labor Party knows how to solve. This is a standard 
formula of Labor and centre Zionism which hasn’t changed for more 
than 75 years. On the same day ‘a senior officer of the Central 
Command of the [[Israel]]i Army’, which is in charge of the West Bank, 
was interviewed by Nahum Barnea for Yediot Ahronot. The officer 
defined ‘the official policy of the [[Israel]]i Army as providing every 
Jew in every settlement, whether of the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, 
with exactly the same degree of security and well-being as Jews of </p>
<p>165 </p>
<p>166 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Haifa and Tel Aviv have during all stages of the peace process and 
afterwards’. Needless to say, nothing was said about the security 
of the Palestinians who, more than before Oslo, are harassed by 
the settlers backed by the Army and by Arafat’s secret police forces 
backed by the Shabak. </p>
<p>The plan which the [[Israel]]i Army already implements in the 
[[Territories]] (known as ‘Rainbow of Colours’) was published in the 
Hebrew press in [[November]] [[1994]], but its crucial feature, the 
‘bypassing roads’ on which only the Jewish settlers, their visitors 
and the [[Israel]]i Army will be permitted to drive, was discussed by 
the press already in [[September]]. Reinhart notes that the plan had 
been ‘formulated already in the early [[1980]]s’ by the settlers, but 
under Likud and ‘national unity’ [[government]]s nothing much was 
done to implement it: ‘It is “the peace [[government]]” which opened 
new vistas for the plan’s implementation.’ The annual cost of the 
plan is one billion shekels [$330 million], to be continued for three 
years. Most of the cost, as noted by Meir Shteglitz (Yediot Ahronot, 
9 [[April]]) [[Israel]] expects to be covered by the US. Relying on an 
interview given by the commander of the Central Command, 
General Biran, to [[Haaretz]] on 28 [[April]], Reinhart described the plan 
as ‘envisaging the maximal defence of all existing Jewish settlements 
and the partition of the West Bank into enclaves containing Arab 
localities. Each enclave is to be surrounded by bypassing roads, 
settlements and [[Israel]]i Army fortresses. The situation will be then 
the same as in the Gaza Strip. If [[Israel]] ever decides to withdraw 
its troops from any downtown area of an Arab city [of the West 
Bank], the plan is to guarantee that the [[Israel]]i Army will continue 
to rule that city from outside.’ Indeed, ‘control from outside’ 1s a 
favourite term of Rabin and other Labor stalwarts, in use from before 
the [[June]] [[1992]] elections. </p>
<p>Actually the plan was formulated in [[1977]] by Ariel Sharon and 
it was then described in the Hebrew press in detail. At that time 
Sharon was still ‘only’ an Agriculture Minister. Rabin and Peres, 
fresh from their defeat in the [[1977]] elections didn’t object to the 
plan, but Begin and Weizman (Defence Minister [[1977]]-80) did, 
since they assigned a higher priority to making peace with [[Egypt]]. 
When Begin began to lose his sanity in [[1981]] and Sharon became 
Defence Minister, the highest priority was assigned to the invasion 
of [[Lebanon]]. To the best of my knowledge, the plan under current 
implementation has since remained the [[Israel]]i Security System’s 
‘preferable solution’ to ‘the problem’ of Palestinians in the 
[[Territories]]. According to information available in the Hebrew 
press, the plan began to be implemented in the Gaza Strip right 
after Oslo. Reinhart quotes press sources showing that in the West 
Bank the beginnings of its implementation date from [[July]] [[1994]] 
when, in an amicable meeting, Rabin agreed with Gush Emunim </p>
<p>IDEOLOGY AND THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 167 </p>
<p>leaders ‘who explained to him that construction of the bypassing 
roads lay in the common interest of both the [[government]] and the 
Jewish settlers. At the same time Rabin was told the same by [the 
then Chief of Staff] Barak’. The plan was welcomed by Gush 
Emunim leaders in internal writings, but attacked in public. 
According to General Biran the plan ‘was intended to give the 
settlers the full opportunity to live a normal life. I take this occasion 
to stress that no Jewish settlement whatsover will ever be removed 
from its place. In order to achieve this goal the [[Israel]]i Army is now 
implementing a number of plans, such as the construction of the 
bypassing roads and of separate electricity and water networks 
intended to guarantee that each Jewish settlement will have 
maximum security and [[welfare]].’ </p>
<p>Reinhart provides sophisticated but in my view insufficient 
explanation of why the apartheid-like ‘Rainbow of Colours’ plan 
was welcomed by most of the Jewish and Palestinian ‘peace camp’. 
All too clearly, the plan favoured the settlers and was intended to 
perpetuate the [[Israel]]i conquest of the [[Territories]] more effectually 
than before, by using ‘control from outside’. Yet Peace Now 
extolled this racist plan as ‘a positive sign of implementation of the 
peace process’, and its leaders rushed to convince Arafat in Gaza 
about its virtues. Noting that the settlers and the nght wing censured 
the “Rainbow of Colours’ plan as ‘selling out the Land to the 
Gentiles’, Reinhart observes that ‘the religious settlers and Likud 
had long ago discovered the panacea for neutralizing the left. As 
soon as they attack the [[government]], the doves of various persuasions 
stand to attention ready to help the [[government]] pursue the “peace 
process”. The result is that the supporters of a plan devised by the 
settlers can pass for “peace lovers”. The more one insists that the 
[[government]] speeds up carrying out this plan in the whole of the 
West Bank, the more reputation for “peace loving” he acquires. 
And whoever dares to oppose this plan is instantly censured by the 
doves for “sabotaging the peace” and branded as one of those 
“extremists from both sides” who by virtue of opposing Rabin’s 
policies is “objectively against peace”’.’ </p>
<p>This explanation is correct on a tactical level. It points out how 
the Oslo process in effect advanced the cause of the [[Israel]]i apartheid, 
by virtue of making it possible to brand Jewish or Palestinian 
opponents of [[racism]] as ‘enemies of peace’. Yet in my view Reinhart, 
like other Jewish leftists misses the main point. I agree with her 
prognosis of the effects of the ‘Rainbow of Colours’ upon the 
Palestinians. She writes, “The meaning of the plan is that we will 
solve the problem of two million Palestinians in the [[Territories]] by 
im[[prison]]ing them in ghettoes, starving them and turning them into 
beggars. But instead of calling it “an occupation”, we will present 
it as a step toward a Palestinian state. We will crush Palestinian </p>
<p>168 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>throats with our boots while smiling to them nicely,’ [a clear 
allusion to Shimon Peres]. But the point which Reinhart misses is 
that not only has Labor’s version of Jewish [[racism]] always been much 
more hypocritical and hence more dangerous than Likud’s, but it 
is also more noxious in terms of the actual oppression of its victims. 
I will return to this point below. </p>
<p>Meron Benvenisti’s presentation in [[Haaretz]] (27 [[April]]) is similar 
to Reinhart’s. He also derides the Zionist doves who support [[Israel]]i 
brutalities committed after Oslo in general and the ‘Rainbow of 
Colours’ in particular, while reassuring the Palestinians that these 
are means conducive to the Palestinian state, ‘at first only in the 
Gaza Strip’. Benvenisti says that ‘far from promoting justice, peace 
or progress, a world-view reduced to establishing a state as its 
single goal cannot but be empty, deceitful and conforming to 
[[Israel]]i interests. Now, when the Palestinian Authority has an 
autonomous authority in domestic affairs, its corruption and 
arbitrariness in the Gaza Strip forms a contrast to the ideals of 
human freedom and dignity, and the struggle against deprivation. 
Hence, even if [[Israel]] grants Arafat a semblance of a state, no relief 
can be expected in the conditions of oppression, control and 
exploitation. Such conditions were dictated by [[Israel]] to Arafat in 
the Oslo and Cairo Accords. This is why no conceivable change 
of labels may prompt the Palestinian population to identify 
ideologically with Arafat’s regime.’ Benvenisti says that [[Israel]] may 
agree to Arafat’s statehood, but only in order to present it as a 
‘seeming concession enabling [[Israel]] to demand from the Palestinians 
in return “more flexibility”, in acquiescing to the perpetuation of 
the [[Israel]]i colonial rule over the [[Territories]]’. I don’t think the 
Labor [[government]] will agree to an independent Palestinian state, 
even in the Gaza Strip alone. The talk about such a prospect was 
no more than a typical ploy by Shimon Peres, intended to extract 
from Arafat more compliance with [[Israel]]i demands. Had Labor 
intended to establish a Palestinian state, it would have exploited 
it in the fast-approaching [[Israel]]i election campaign. Moreover, 
Rabin would have sought to justify it in his numerous Passover Eve 
interviews. Yet the [[Israel]]i [[government]] has done nothing in order 
to explain and justify such a policy change to the [[Israel]]i public. </p>
<p>To describe the aims of the ‘Rainbow of Colours’ apartheid, 
Benvenisti speaks, in my view cogently, of ‘conceptual ethnic 
cleansing, 1.e. of erasing the others from one’s consciousness. It 
cannot be attributed only to chance that the so-called “peace 
process” with the Palestinians is in Jewish society accompanied by 
a high incidence of ethnocentrism approaching [[racism]], of tribal 
forms of morality and of the failure to distinguish between the moral 
right to exist and the moral obligation to behave decently.’ Among 
Benvenisti’s examples of such ‘incidence’, a particularly outrageous </p>
<p>IDEOLOGY AND THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 169 </p>
<p>act (at least in my view) was the imposition of a round-the-clock 
curfew on Palestinians of Hebron so as to let the visitors of Jewish 
settlers ‘hold a picnic’, and roam around the city in perfect safety. 
For a single day during the Passover week the city was for this 
purpose filled with troops: a circumstance which let the picnickers 
exult over Palestinians confined in their houses and throw stones 
at them, especially if they dared to look out from their windows. 
The whole thing was intended as a concession of Rabin to Gush 
Emunim. It nevertheless failed to prevent the latter to use the day 
for the grossest forms of abuse of what they call ‘the [[government]] 
of wickedness’, including public prayers to God to ‘abolish it 
quickly’. </p>
<p>Benvenisti concludes, rightly in my view, that ‘the Oslo process, 
the resultant ideology of segregation and the resultant security 
considerations are intended to cloak [[[Israel]]i] ethnic cleansing with 
an aura of respectability. Sure, my use of that term may be viewed 
as a manifestation of extremism compared to its usual use as an 
elegant term for expulsions and mass murders. But in my view ethnic 
cleansing may also be more limited in time. A closure of the 
[[Territories]] or a curfew intended to cleanse the public space from 
the presence of “others” are perfect examples of such conceptual 
ethnic cleansing limited in time.’ </p>
<p>Those developments could have been predicted by those who 
took the trouble to analyse the actual Zionist policies pursued 
since the [[1920]]s, and after [[1967]] in the [[Territories]]. Let me begin 
with [[Israel]] itself. The laws of the State of [[Israel]] pertaining to the 
use of land are based on the principle of discrimination against all 
non-Jews. The State of [[Israel]] has turned most of the land in [[Israel]] 
(about 92 per cent) into ‘state land’. After those lands are defined 
as owned by the State of [[Israel]] they can be leased for long periods 
only to Jews. The right to a long-term lease of such land is denied 
to all non-Jews without a single exception. This denial is enforced 
by placing all state lands under the administration by the Jewish 
National Fund, a branch of the World Zionist Organization, whose 
racist statutes forbid their long-term lease, or any other use, to non- 
Jews. Their lease to Jews, conditioned upon the prohibition of 
sub-lease to non-Jews, is granted for the period of 49-years with 
an automatic renewal for another 49-year period. Consequently, 
they are treated as [[property]] and are bought, sold and mortgaged, 
provided the party to the deal is Jewish. The small and decreasing 
number of cases of leasing state land to non-Jews for grazing is never 
for more than eleven months. A Jewish leasee of state land is 
allowed, often subsidized or otherwise encouraged, to develop the 
land and especially to build a house for himself there, but non-Jewish 
leasee is strictly prohibited to do so. Leasing state land to a non- 
Jew is accompanied by restrictive conditions, such as the prohibition </p>
<p>170 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>of construction or development, or of sub-leasing it to somebody 
else. By the way, membership of all kibbutzim and moshavim 
(whose supposed ‘socialist’ or ‘utopian’ character 1s so stridently 
advertised outside [[Israel]]) is strictly limited to Jews by virtue of their 
being all located on state land. Non-Jews who desire to become 
members of a kibbutz, even a kibbutz whose Jewish members are 
atheists, must convert to Judaism. The kibbutz movements, in 
cooperation with the [[Israel]]i Chief Rabbinate, keep special training 
facilities for preparing ‘easy’, (that is, in most cases fake) conversions 
to Judaism for such people. </p>
<p>As a consequence the Galilee can be described as the land of 
apartheid. Palestinian localities are bursting with population growth 
but are surrounded by state land which they cannot use it in order 
to expand. The town of Sakhnin in the Galilee, inhabited by about 
25,000 Palestinians, is surrounded by state land allotted to three 
kibbutzim founded in the [[1970]]s for the express purpose to ‘guard 
state land’ from ‘Arab encroachment’. Those kibbutzim are in 
every respect failures. The original members had long ago left 
them and so did their successors, but new Jewish volunteers (mostly 
from the ‘peace camp’) are being sent there all the time. Those 
kibbutzim receive huge subsidies from the [[Israel]]i [[government]] and 
from the Jewish Agency, that is, ultimately from tax-free 
contributions of Jews all around the world. No one proposes, even 
for the sake of efficiency or winning support of the Palestinians for 
the peace process, that even the tiniest part of state land around 
Sakhnin be allotted to non-Jews of that town. Obviously, an 
ideological consideration overrides all political considerations, as 
in religion the sacred always overrides the profane. </p>
<p>There are many states which in the past were systematically 
engaged in land robbery. The US, for example, robbed the [[Indian]]s 
of their land, transforming most of it into state land. Nevertheless, 
this land is now available for use by any US citizen. If a Jew were 
in the US prohibited to lease land belonging to the state only 
because he were Jewish, this would be rightly interpreted as anti- 
Semitism. But anti-Semitism is already considered in the US 
disreputable, whereas in [[Israel]] ‘Zionism’ is the official state ideology 
and is indoctrinated as a goal of public education. Of course, the 
land issue is no more than a single example of official discrimination 
against the non-Jews which pervades all walks of life in [[Israel]], 
victimizing mainly the Palestinians. Some Zionists recently want 
to alleviate its effects, but no Zionist party nor Zionist politician 
has ever proposed to abolish it or had second thoughts about its 
underlying ideology. ‘The whole discriminatory system is obviously 
intended to be practised in the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>It is easy to see that by the rigorous enforcement of such laws, 
also against the most loyal supporters of the state, [[Israel]] is </p>
<p>IDEOLOGY AND THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 171 </p>
<p>under[[mining]] its own imperial and military power. Let me give two 
instances of this. The first concerns the Druzes who serve in the 
[[Israel]]i Army, Police and Intelligence, often reaching high ranks in 
those services. They are nevertheless legally barred from use of the 
state land and as non-Jews they suffer from other discriminatory 
laws as well. The same can be said about other Palestinians who 
either serve in the above-mentioned security services or reach high 
ranks in various branches of civil service, for example as judges. 
[[Israel]] had appointed Palestinians to be consuls and other diplomatic 
[[representative]]s. It is now contemplating appointing the first 
Palestinian ambassador. But a Palestinian general, ambassador or 
judge is still subject to the discussed discriminatory laws. He still 
does not have the right to lease even a small plot of state land, 
whereas any released Jewish murderer has this right as matter 
of course. </p>
<p>Right now, Palestinians may or may not perceive themselves as 
victims of [[Israel]]i discrimination. Many of them are too mystified 
by their feudal mindset to perceive it clearly. If anything, that 
mindset dictates to them an almost exclusive concern with the loss 
of ancestral [[property]]. But their eventual modernization is inevitable. 
It is anticipated even by the [[Israel]]i ‘Arabist experts’ who are no 
fools. As soon as it comes, the Palestinians are bound to perceive 
themselves first and foremost as victims of [[Israel]]i legal 
discrimination, applied against them by virtue of their being non- 
Jews. When this occurs, [[Israel]]’s domestic and international position 
can be expected to become highly unstable. Some [[Israel]]i decision- 
makers can be presumed to be aware of it. It can even be presumed 
that a major reason of the Oslo process was the hope (common 
to both [[Israel]] and Arafat) to arrest the process of Palestinian 
society’s change by using force to refeudalize it. But the [[Israel]]i 
experts must know that the probability of arresting social change 
is very low, at least within [[Israel]]. In other words, [[Israel]] as an imperial 
power is not even contemplating adapting itself to changing 
circumstances in a way other than the way previous imperial 
powers did with success. To return to the Druze case: even if 
Brigadier-General (Reserves) Muhammad Kana’an, who performed 
to perfection the duties of military commander of the Gaza Strip 
during the Intifada and who yet, as a non-Jew is as discriminated 
against by [[Israel]] as any other non-Jew, is not aware of this fact, 
his sons and sons of other Druze are sure to be aware of it in a 
not-so-distant future. </p>
<p>The second example concerns the two Arab villages in Galilee, 
Bir’am and Ikrit. The inhabitants of both are Christians who didn’t 
resist [[Israel]]i forces in [[1948]], and who surrendered as soon as the 
[[Israel]]i Army was approaching. Their inhabitants were evacuated 
‘for two weeks only’, as was solemnly promised in the capitulation </p>
<p>C72 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>accord signed by the [[Israel]]i Army. After two weeks, however, the 
Army reneged on its promise. In [[1951]] the Supreme Court ruled 
in favour of the villagers’ return, but its verdict was soon overruled 
on the basis of the ‘Defence Regulations [[1945]]’. These regulations 
had originally been passed by the [[British]] to be used against the Jews. 
Before the creation of the State of [[Israel]] they were described by 
some of the most respected Jewish legal authorities in Palestine as 
“Nazi-like laws’, or as ‘even worse than the Nazi laws’, because they 
provided the [[government]] with almost unlimited powers on the 
condition of exercising them through the Army. Begin’s Deputy 
Prime Minister, Simha Erlich, quipped that ‘these Regulations let 
a general commanding the Jerusalem district or a Defence Minister 
surround the Knesset by tanks and arrest its members with perfect 
legality.” The State of [[Israel]] nevertheless kept them in force, 
applying them, however, almost exclusively against non-Jews. In 
the case of Bir’am and Ikrit, Ben Gurion’s administration was able 
to respond to the Supreme Court’s verdict by using the Defence 
Regulations [[1945]] to confiscate land belonging to the two villages 
and by ordering the Air Force to [[bomb]] both villages on Christmas 
Eve [[1951]]; the adult male villagers were rounded up and forced to 
watch from the nearby hill how their houses were being demolished. 
Only the churches were spared from destruction: they serve to this 
day as destinations for pilgrimage for the former villagers who 
retain their [[Israel]]i citizenship. The remainder of the land was 
allocated to kibbutzim and moshavim, with a ‘left-wing’ kibbutz 
(which even adopted Bir’am’s name) receiving the lion’s share. The 
Supreme Court ruled that these confiscations and demolition 
orders had been perfectly legal. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the inhabitants of the two villages have been 
campaigning up to this very day: particularly those of Bir’am who 
are all of Maronite religion and many quite right-wing politically. 
Rationally speaking, their campaign could have a good chance in 
succeeding, especially after they solemnly and repeatedly declared 
that they weren’t demanding their farmlands, but only the church, 
the neighbouring cemetery and a tiny plot nearby to be used as a 
museum. All pragmatic considerations would be in favour of 
accepting their modest request. After all, many of them serve in 
the [[Israel]]i Police. They have close connections with Maronites in 
[[Lebanon]] which [[Israel]] had exploited before and during its invasion 
of [[Lebanon]]. Their case is supported by the Catholic Church and 
other important international bodies. Yet there is no chance that 
their request may be accepted, least so by the current ‘peace 
[[government]]’. </p>
<p>For the analysis of [[Israel]]i policies in the era of the ‘peace process’, 
itis even more important to recall that by the time the Oslo Accord 
was signed [[Israel]] had already turned about 70 per cent of West Bank </p>
<p>IDEOLOGY AND THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 173 </p>
<p>land into ‘state land’ which, like in [[Israel]], could be leased only to 
Jews. (By further confiscations this percentage has after Oslo risen 
to 72 or 73 per cent but for the purpose of this report I will use 
the round figure 70 per cent.) All the West Bank settlements being 
built on this land, are intended only for Jews, who don’t even need 
to be [[Israel]]i. Jews from all over the world are entitled to settle on 
this land. Hence the [[Western]] media are wrong (possibly even 
deliberately) in their persistent use of the term ‘[[Israel]]i settlements’. 
The fact is that a non-Jewish [[Israel]]i citizen, like Brigadier-General 
(Reserves) Muhammad Kana’an, is denied the legal right to settle 
in these settlements; and so are Christians who fervently support 
‘[[Great]]er [[Israel]]’. If we suppose that one day the Spirit will command 
the Reverend Jerry Falwell or the Reverend Pat Robertson to leave 
their holy work in the US in order to settle in Kiryat Arba, they 
won’t be allowed to as non-Jews. But if we suppose that the Spirit 
will command them to convert to Judaism, they will become legally 
eligible to settle in any Jewish settlement right from the moment 
their conversion is finalized. This 1s not just a theoretical possibility, 
as groups of converts to Judaism from some obscure tribes in [[Peru]] 
and India have actually been brought and settled in the [[Territories]]. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Druze veterans (some of whom profess very 
hawkish views) have made several attempts of to apply for an 
allotment of West Bank state land in order to establish a Druze 
settlement there. All such requests were firmly denied, against 
best [[Israel]]i interest. Moreover, especially since the inception of the 
Intifada, Palestinian collaborators living in fear of [[death]] have 
persistently requested the [[Israel]]i authorities to let them settle in 
Jewish settlements of the West Bank, even temporarily. As some 
of them argued, this would be highly advantageous to [[Israel]]i 
Intelligence since they could live close to their former homes and 
be able to maintain to some extent their former contacts. Yet 
again, all such requests were firmly denied. After Oslo, [[Israel]] had 
to remove some collaborators from the West Bank and settle them 
in [[Israel]]. But even then, instead of allotting them any state land, 
it rented private land or private housing for the purpose. </p>
<p>Let me return to the West Bank land issue. Of the 70 per cent 
of its land which became state land, only 16 per cent has actually 
been allocated to Jewish settlements. The remaining 54 per cent 
stands empty. It needs to be acknowledged that removing Jewish 
settlements, perhaps even a single one of them, may well give rise 
to grave political problems, including the risk of armed clashes which 
may even escalate into a civil war. But the prospect of returning 
some of the 54 per cent of empty state land back to Palestinian 
peasants carries only minimal risks. It could have been done easily 
during the first months after Oslo. Since the attachment of the 
Palestinians (not only the peasants but of the entire nation) to the </p>
<p>174 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>land is profound, and the well-justified fear of being driven away 
from it palpable, one can easily imagine the effect of a partial 
restitution of the empty 54 per cent of the West Bank land on the 
Palestinian masses. A better way of binding Palestinian public 
opinion to [[Israel]]i interests served by the Oslo and Cairo Accords 
could hardly be imagined. </p>
<p>The same is true for the Gaza Strip. If anything, its case is more 
glaring because the number of Jewish settlers there — 5,000 when 
the Oslo Accord was signed and since increased to about 8,000 — 
is incommensurably smaller than the number of Jewish settlers in 
the West Bank — 130,000 when the Oslo Accord was signed, since 
increased to about 160,000, East Jerusalem excluded. Also, the 
proportion of Jewish settlers to Palestinians in the Gaza Strip 
(officially 800,000, in reality about million) is completely different 
in scale than the proportion of the West Bank Jewish settlers to West 
Bank Palestinians (officially about 1,200,000, in reality about 
1,300,000 excluding East Jerusalem). Yet about 28 per cent of the 
Strip’s area duly converted to state land, was allotted to Jewish 
settlers long before Oslo and after Oslo withheld from the 
autonomy’s jurisdiction. Also in the Strip no empty state land was 
restored to Palestinian ownership. In the case of the Gaza Strip I 
don’t know the proportion of the empty to the settled state lands, 
but I know that the former exist. In the case of settlement of 
Netzarim (whose residents are for the most part engaged in studying 
Talmud), detailed maps have been published in the Hebrew press 
(for example, [[Haaretz]], 10 [[April]]). The maps show a large land area 
attached to that settlement, necessarily empty but of course denied 
to the Palestinians. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Rabin hasn’t contemplated giving back to 
Palestinian peasants, or even to the Palestinian Authority, a few 
symbolic dunums of the state land around Netzarim. True, some 
Zionist ‘peaceniks’ are advocating the removal of the whole Jewish 
settlement of Netzarim saying that if they remain, they may be [[kill]]ed 
by Palestinians. As mentioned above, this is regarded as a factor 
which may temporarily override ideological considerations. But no 
Zionist ‘peace lover’ has as yet advocated the return of an empty 
state land for the sake of a political advantage. This can be 
generalized. The peace process was ‘sold’ to [[Israel]]i Jews not only 
as an effective means of guaranteeing their security, but also as 
potentially profitable from the [[trade]] with Arab states expected to 
expand in its wake. Nevertheless, no Zionist has ever proposed that 
the sacred ideology of discriminating against non-Jews be for once 
sacrificed for the sake of advancing the Oslo process and thus 
enhancing [[Israel]]’s power and wealth. To the best of my recollection, 
[[Israel]] (or the Zionist Movement before its inception) has never </p>
<p>PeOrpeGn Aew THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 175 </p>
<p>sacrificed its ideology on the altar of merely political considerations 
or economic interests. </p>
<p>In other words, empirical evidence (valid as anything in politics 
can be valid) shows that [[Israel]]i policies are primarily ideologically 
motivated and the ideology by which they are motivated is 
totalitarian in nature. This ideology can be easily known since it 
is enshrined in the writings of the founders of Labor Zionism, and 
it can be easily inferred from [[Israel]]i laws, regulations and pursued 
policies. Those who, like Arafat, his henchmen and most Palestinian 
intellectuals, have through all these years failed to make an 
intellectual effort to study seriously this ideology, have only 
themselves to blame for being stunned by all the developments in 
the 20 months after Oslo. Whoever after Oslo stopped denouncing 
[[Israel]]i ‘imperialism’ for the sake of a meaningless ‘peace of the brave’ 
slogan, showed that he learned nothing and forgot nothing. Their 
blunder is the greater since [[Israel]] is by no means unique In pursuing 
ideologically determined policies. Strict ideological considerations 
determine policies in plenty of other past and present states. In other 
cases an ideology underlying a given policy, however, is not only 
openly admitted by a state concerned, but also well-known and 
discussed beyond its borders. [[Israel]] is indeed unique in that the 
discriminatory Jewish ideology dictating its policies is hardly ever 
discussed beyond its borders, due to the fear of offending the Jews 
of the Diaspora and of being labelled by their powerful organizations 
as an ‘anti-Semite’ or ‘Jewish self-hater’. At the same time in [[Israel]] 
the ideology of discriminating against all non-Jews is not only 
openly admitted but also advocated as guaranteeing the character 
of [[Israel]] as a ‘Jewish state’ mandated to preserve its ‘Jewish 
character’. The Jewish supporters of [[Israel]]i discriminatory practices 
admit that they thus want to preserve the ‘Jewish character’ of [[Israel]], 
conceived of by them and by the majority of [[Israel]]i Jews, as the 
legacy of historical Judaism. Indeed, if we overlook modern times, 
there is sufficient truth in this claim. Until the advent of modern 
times all Jews firmly believed that non-Jews should be discriminated 
against whenever possible. It now turns out that the Jewish 
Enlightenment failed to change the attitudes of most Jews in this 
respect. Many irreligious Jews still believe that for the sake of 
Jewish religious law and tradition which commanded the 
discrimination of the non-Jews, the latter should be discriminated 
in the ‘Jewish state’ forever. This is professed in spite, or perhaps 
even because of the undeniable fact that this discrimination has the 
same character as that which the anti-Semites want to apply against 
the Jews. </p>
<p>In the light of the ideological impact upon actual [[Israel]]i policies, 
the critiques of the latter by the pragmatists of the [[Israel]]i left are 
valid, yet in one crucial respect inadequate. For all their superiority </p>
<p>176 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>to the ‘experts in [[Israel]]i affairs’ from the [[Western]] press, the [[Israel]]i 
leftists always seem puzzled by the policies [[Israel]] 1s pursuing. They 
never cease to offer the [[Israel]]i [[government]] ‘good advice’ on how 
it can gain in its relations with the Arabs by “being moderate’. 
Analysis and experience show that offering such advice amounts 
to an exercise in futility. Numerous historical analogies, including 
the recent collapse of communist regimes in [[Europe]], show 
conclusively that a real change 1s impossible as long as a party 
representing no matter how flexibly a state ideology stays in power. 
In [[Israel]], power is firmly in the hand of the Security System and 
of the Zionist parties whose deep commitment to Zionist ideology 
has not been challenged. On the other hand, those analogies show 
that once the power of a state ideology is challenged in public, it 
means that a real change is on its way. Eventually, such a change 
may materialize in a sudden disintegration of the state ideology and 
the state apparatus supporting it. This happened since the late [[1970]]s 
in [[Poland]]. KOR and Solidarity, which challenged the ideological 
basis of the state, were the true harbingers of the fall of [[Europe]]an 
communism; whereas the plethora of reforms imposed by the 
Polish Communist Party from above amounted to no more than 
palliatives which changed nothing. The [[Israel]]i ideology, which 
had been only slightly undermined in the period of [[1974]]-93, has 
been again revitalized in the aftermath of Oslo. Due to its great social 
cohesiveness, military and particularly [[nuclear]] power and the 
increasing support of the US [[Israel]] feels at present too strong to 
offer even palliative concessions to Palestinians. Under those 
conditions ideological considerations can remain to be predominant, 
except when Jewish lives are lost. </p>
<p>From high abstraction let me again pass to matters more concrete 
and show how the actual [[Israel]]i policies in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank draw from the ideology of continuous discrimination 
by means more effectual than beforehand. Let me first deal with 
the Gaza Strip. Detailed maps of the Strip often published by the 
Hebrew press (but never by the Palestinian press!) show how it is 
criss-crossed by ‘military roads’ which according to the Cairo 
Accords remain under [[Israel]]i jurisdiction. Those roads are 
constantly patrolled by the [[Israel]]i Army, either separately or jointly 
with the Palestinian police. The [[Israel]]i Army has the right to close 
any such road to all Palestinian traffic, even if it runs deep within 
the autonomy, and it actually uses this right after any Palestinian 
assault. For example, [[Haaretz]] (11 [[April]]) reported that the [[Israel]]i 
Army closed ‘until further notice’ two road sections deep inside 
the autonomy ‘to all Palestinian vehicles’ after two assaults which 
occurred two days earlier. Appended to the report was a map 
showing the Strip’s roads. One of them, called ‘Gaza city bypassing 
road’, traverses the entire length of the Strip, carefully bypassing </p>
<p>IDEOLOGY AND THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 177 </p>
<p>the cities and refugee camps. A military road and a narrow strip 
of land not included in the autonomy cuts it off from [[Egypt]]. A 
number of parallel roads traverse the Strip’s autonomous area 
from the [[Israel]]i border on its east side to the sea or a Jewish 
settlement block on the west. One such road is the Netzarim road. 
It begins at an authorized entry point to the autonomy at Nahal 
Oz. From there it runs westward, skirting all Palestinian localities. 
After crossing the ‘Gaza city bypassing road’ it reaches Netzarim. 
It does not end there, however, but continues to a military fortress 
on the sea. It thus cuts the Gaza Strip into two parts. All authorized 
entry points to the autonomy are located at the beginning of 
military roads. </p>
<p>The overall effect is that the autonomous part of the Gaza Strip 
is sliced into enclaves controlled by the bypassing roads. The role 
of the Jewish settlements is not only to guard state land, but also 
to serve as pivots of the road grid devised to ensure a perpetual [[Israel]]i 
control of the Strip under a new and more effective form. This 
‘control from outside’ allows the Army to dominate the Strip (and 
to re[[conquer]] it with a minimum effort if need be) without having 
to commit a large number of personnel for constant patrolling and 
pacifying the Strip’s towns and refugee camps ‘from inside’. The 
latter task is now being undertaken on [[Israel]]’s behalf by various 
uniformed and secret polices under Arafat’s command. </p>
<p>Turning to the West Bank, the task of the ‘Rainbow of Colours’ 
is to produce results similar to those already existing in the Gaza 
Strip. The conditions there may turn out even worse, due to a much 
larger number of settlers and to the extensive construction of the 
separate networks of roads, electricity and water supplies for the 
settlers which cannot but pass near or through the Palestinian 
enclaves. Moreover, the West Bank includes the ‘[[Great]]er Jerusalem’ 
area in which the apartheid is practised more strictly than elsewhere. 
‘[[Great]]er Jerusalem’ officially extends from Ramallah to the south 
of Bethlehem, but in the future it can be assumed to grow. To make 
the matters worse, the Palestinians from the [[Territories]] are to be 
forever barred from crossing to [[Israel]]. Their labour force is to be 
employed in ‘industrial parks’ exporting mostly to the US. Even 
at its worst, [[South]] [[Africa]]n apartheid was not as all-inclusive as what 
is planned for the West Bank and what already exists in the 
Gaza Strip. </p>
<p>Why do the experts of the [[Israel]]i [[government]] expect acquiescence 
to this situation on the part of the Palestinians (including the [[Israel]]i 
citizens among them, whose in[[flu]]ence in Knesset can be 
considerable) and on the part of international public opinion? 
[[Israel]]i experts and the [[government]] apparently anticipate to make 
those realities palatable for both parties as long as [[Israel]] confines 
itself only to ‘control from outside’, while leaving ‘control from </p>
<p>178 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>inside’ (that is, the job of actually enforcing order) in the hands of 
[[Israel]]’s Palestinian proxies who will be granted a semblance of an 
independent authority. (I am not going to discuss international 
public opinion because Latin [[America]]n and [[Africa]]n precedents 
make me convinced that the response of the world at large to the 
‘control from inside’ will be as acquiescent as in Palestine.) Much 
as I abhor the [[Israel]]i [[government]]’s plans on moral grounds, this 
anticipation strikes me as well-grounded. After all, a large majority 
of Palestinians have tamely acquiesced to the numerous violations 
of human rights committed directly by Arafat’s regime in the Gaza 
Strip and by his secret police in the West Bank. The potentially 
violent dispute between Arafat and Hamas is about power rather 
than about human or any other rights. </p>
<p>This is the place to recall that the standard of life in the Strip 
has decreased by about 60 per cent since Arafat arrived there. Of 
course, the main responsibility for this state of affairs is [[Israel]]’s, 
although Arafat’s contribution to it through his corruption and 
inefficiency shouldn’t be overlooked. But the point I am trying to 
make is not at all economic. To keep the Palestinians as poor as 
possible has always been an aim of [[Israel]]i policy, in my view also 
in order to arrest social change in their society. With Arafat’s 
complicity [[Israel]] now can achieve this aim without eliciting any 
strong [[[[protest]]s]], and without spending much of its manpower on 
suppressing such [[[[protest]]s]]. In other words, it can impoverish the 
Palestinians cheaply and effectively. Bureaucracies tend to believe 
that their successes can be stretched indefinitely, and the [[Israel]]i 
Security System is no exception. No wonder it believes that if a 
solution tested in the Gaza Strip has worked well there, it would 
also work well when the ‘Rainbow of Colours’ is implemented in 
the West Bank. Likewise, the Security System probably believes 
that if the Palestinian uniformed and secret police obey Arafat’s 
orders so faithfully, they will continue to do so when commanded 
by somebody else. </p>
<p>Those hypotheses about the [[Israel]]i Security System’s modes of 
thinking can be confirmed by facts. For example, while much land 
is now being confiscated in the West Bank for the purpose of 
constructing the bypassing roads, there have been few if any popular 
[[[[protest]]s]] against those confiscations. The [[[[protest]]s]] of the Palestinian 
Authority against the recent confiscations of land in East Jerusalem 
stand in glaring contrast to its silence in cases of the much more 
massive land confiscations currently going on elsewhere in the 
West Bank. Danny Rubinstein, writing in [[Haaretz]] (12 [[May]]), 
explains that in the case of Jerusalem Arafat is constrained to 
[[protest]] by the leaders of Arab and Muslim states, for whose publics 
Jerusalem is a particularly sensitive religious issue. The same 
leaders, however, couldn’t care less about the West Bank. Rubinstein </p>
<p>IDEOLOGY AND THE ANALY[[SIS]] OF ISRAELI POLICY 179 </p>
<p>reports that ‘many delegations from West Bank localities came 
recently to Arafat. Their grievances were many, but they particularly 
emphasized that their lands were being confiscated. Arafat did his 
best to mollify those delegations. For example, a delegation of 
inhabitants of [the town of] Al-Birah, located near Ramallah, who 
received land confiscation orders from [[Israel]]i authorities intending 
to build a road bypassing their town to serve the needs of the 
settlement of Psagot, recently requested Arafat to intervene to 
have these orders annulled. One delegate told me how stunned he 
was by Arafat’s response. Arafat told them: “Forget this matter. 
This is only a minor confiscation. It is preferable to have this land 
confiscated than Psagot settlers driving through your town and 
causing trouble. Owing to this confiscation, the settlers will at 
least be able to bypass your town.”’ Rubinstein says that Arafat is 
giving such ‘advice whenever he fears that his opposition to an [[Israel]]i 
measure may result in cancellation of his negotiations with [[Israel]]’. 
I can confirm Rubinstein’s view by information from my own 
sources, both [[Israel]]i and Palestinian. Moreover, Arafat’s ‘advice’ 
works, because it is backed by the people’s fear of his thugs. This 
is why most attempts to organize popular [[[[protest]]s]] against the 
confiscation of land have been stifled. [[Israel]] could not expect a more 
effective support for its apartheid policies than Arafat’s. </p>
<p>Yet in two factual points I differ from the [[Israel]]i Security Systemm’s 
assessments of Arafat’s role. First, they ignore the impact of Arafat’s 
behaviour on the Jewish public in [[Israel]]. In order to let Arafat serve 
[[Israel]]i interests effectively, [[Israel]] must salvage his dwindling prestige 
among the Palestinians, and for that purpose leaves him a 
considerable freedom of expression, never granted to Palestinian 
collaborators before. Arafat takes advantage of this privilege to 
indulge in the most outrageous lies and to make the most provocative 
attacks on [[Israel]]. As an example of the former, one can give his 
oft-repeated assertion that [[Israel]] (or [[Israel]]i Army officers, or 
Shabak’s agents) conspired with Hamas to carry out the Beit-Lid 
terror assault. As an example of the latter, one can give his frequent 
assertion that all of Jerusalem (not only its [[Eastern]] part) belongs 
to the Arabs or to the Muslims. While neither Rabin nor Peres dare 
to expose Arafat as a liar or to denounce his position on Jerusalem 
as incompatible with that of all Zionist parties (even Meretz supports 
the so-called ‘unification of Jerusalem’), the Hebrew press often 
does so, and so do the opposition’s politicians. Rabin’s dwindling 
credibility and popularity can be attributed to the Jewish public’s 
outrage at his condonement of Arafat’s lies and antics. To a much 
greater degree the same is the case of Peres and the entire [[Israel]]i 
‘peace camp’ which seem to be losing whatever political clout they 
once had. In other words, the advantages of the ‘control from 
outside’ are being neutralized by the domestic drawbacks of using </p>
<p>180 OPEN SECRETS </p>
<p>Arafat. As the [[1996]] elections are approaching, the latter factor can 
be assumed to increasingly outweigh the former in importance. </p>
<p>The second point where I differ from the [[Israel]]i Security System’s 
assessments concerns the ‘Rainbow of Colours’. The [[Israel]]i experts 
assume it can last forever, whereas I think it is bound to collapse 
eventually. Even if Arafat succeeds in smashing all opposition to 
his rule, I doubt if he can keep the Palestinian population inside 
their enclaves forever under his control. After all, the facts on the 
ground, including the deterioration of the economy and the 
increased apartheid will be all too tangible for the Palestinians and 
will be bound to undermine Arafat’s standing. At present it is 
mainly Arafat’s vestigial prestige and his use of brute force which 
keeps the ‘control from outside’ functioning. Once all his credibility 
is gone the [[Israel]]i alternative for exercising ‘control from outside’ 
would be by a naked Palestinian dictatorship, Arafat’s or somebody 
else’s. The oppression then unleashed is bound to surpass anything 
experienced in the period of ‘control from inside’. </p>
<p>I am fully conscious of the immense human suffering which such 
an oppression is bound to cause. Yet I do not attribute much 
political importance to the question of whether it can succeed and 
for how long. In any event, it will mark the failure of the ‘control 
from outside’ scheme as an easy and cheap method of domination, 
which can be ‘sold’, Peres-style, to the international public. In the 
last analysis the failure of the ‘control from outside’ cannot but 
mark the end of [[Israel]]i policies based on the absolute priority of 
Zionist ideology. </p>

<p>ISRAELI NUCLEAR AND FOREIGN POLICIES </p>
<p>‘Have you ever heard yourself uttering the cretinous 
liberal mantra “Think globally, act locally”? Read on, if - 
you wish to understand how a truly serious regime will 
put such a slogan into reverse.’ </p>
<p>In this remarkable book, veteran scholar and human rights campaigner 
[[Israel]] Shahak exposes [[Israel]]’s strategic foreign policy as it really is. 
Drawing solely on the Hebrew press, and working very much as an 
insider in the country, Shahak reveals that what [[Israel]]i Jews are told 
about their country’s foreign policy through the national media is 
entirely inconsistent with what the [[Israel]]i [[government]] is telling the rest 
of the world. Shahak demonstrates that, with the support of the US 
Jewish lobby, [[Israel]] is conducting a covert policy of expansionism and 
aims to gain political control, not just of Palestine, but of virtually the 
entire Middle East. </p>
<p>‘Shahak is a very brave man who should be honored for 
his services to humanity ...[He is] one of the most 
remarkable individuals in the contemporary Middle East.’ </p>
<p>[[Israel]] Shahak arrived in Palestine in [[1945]]. He is a retired Professor of 
Organic Chemistry and a life-long human rights activist, writing on 
aspects of Judaism in Hebrew and English. He is the author of the 
highly acclaimed Jewish History, Jewish Religion (? u'« 4) </p>
