<h1>WEF-Linked Bioethicist Called For Genetically Modifying Humans To Induce Meat Intolerance – NewsWars</h1>

<p>"We can use human engineering to make the case that we're intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins" to fight climate change, he says.</p>

<p><strong>A bioethicist linked to the World Economic Forum’s [[Great]] [[Reset]] called for human beings to be genetically engineered to become smaller in size and meat-intolerant to fight “[[climate]] change”.</strong></p>
<p>During a lecture at the [[2016]] World [[Science]] Festival, Dr. Matthew Liao, director of the College of Global Public Health’s Center for Bioethics at [[New]] York University, explained his vision of genetically modifying people in the name of saving the earth.</p>
<p>“People eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet,” Liao said.</p>
<p>Liao discussed making humans intolerant to meat through chemical and hormonal interventions while also admitting that he loves meat too much to give it up.</p>
<p>“But people are not willing to give up meat. Some people will be willing to, but other people – they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say ‘this steak is just too juicy, I can’t do that.’ I’m one of those by the way,” Liao admitted.</p>
<p>“So here’s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about — we have these intolerances,” Liao continued. “For example I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we’re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins.”</p>
<p>“There’s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat. So that’s something we can do through human engineering. We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering,” he added.</p>
<p>But Liao also wants to shrink humans through eugenics or hormone injections so they consume less resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It gets even better: make the people smaller in order to consume less energy. <a href="https://t.co/KD5pjmPptD">pic.twitter.com/KD5pjmPptD</a></p>

<p>In sum, Liao “believes that solving [[climate]] change starts with the individual. That’s why he suggests we turn humans into cat-eyed, meat-allergic, semi-genius, hobbit people,” <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/[[2016]]/12/15/five-ways-bioethicist-wants-change-our-bodies-fight-[[climate]]-change/">reported</a> <em>Marketplace</em> in [[2016]].</p>
<p>Liao’s elitist proposals might seem absurd and immoral, but globalist entities like the World Economic Forum (WEF) and Gates Foundation take his philosophies very seriously.</p>
<p>During the WEF’s 2021 Davos Summit, Liao’s <a href="https://www.smatthewliao.com/wp-content/uploads/[[2012]]/02/HEandClimateChange.pdf">[[2012]] paper</a> “Human Engineering and Climate Change” was brought up during its discussion of the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/[[2019]]/01/why-we-all-need-to-go-on-the-planetary-[[health]]-diet-to-save-the-world/">‘Planetary Health Diet’</a>, a globalist initiative to shift mankind towards plant-based diets and consuming alternative protein sources like <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/[[2020]]/12/pet-food-insect-protein-sustainable/">insects</a> and synthetic lab-grown meat tissue like the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/[[health]]/nutrition/bill-gates-wants-us-to-eat-100percent-synthetic-beef-he-has-a-point/ar-BB1dQ4Ic">Bill Gates-backed Beyond Meats</a>.</p>
<p>“Last year in [[December]], in preparation for this year’s virtual Davos Summit, the World Economic Forum unveiled its bioengineering framework in a presentation called <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/[[2020]]/12/3-scenarios-for-how-bioengineering-could-change-our-world-in-10-years/">‘3 Scenarios for How Bioengineering Could Change Our World in 10 Years’</a>,” <em>BioHackInfo</em> <a href="https://biohackinfo.com/news-wef-world-economic-forum-davos-klaus-schwab-bioengineering/">reported</a> in [[February]].</p>
<p>“Edible [[vaccine]]s grown in plants and <a href="https://biohackinfo.com/crispr/">CRISPR gene-editing</a> were some of the highlights of the framework. The presentation was based off a World Economic Forum sponsored academic paper called <a href="https://elife[[[[science]]]]s.org/articles/54489">Bioengineering Horizon Scan [[2020]]</a>. For this year’s Davos Summit, Liao’s human bioengineering paper was added for consideration as a possible add-on to the ‘Bioengineering Horizon Scan [[2020]]’ paper for both the World Economic Forum’s bioengineering framework and Climate Change framework as it tackles both topics.”</p>
<p>And the WEF claims if you don’t like the idea of eating bugs and lab-grown tissue as part of its [[Great]] [[Reset]] agenda, then it’s because you’re racist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/wef?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@wef</a>, refusing to eat bugs is now racist. If you work for a [[company]] that supports these nut jobs, it's time to apply pressure in the interests of terminating that support. <a href="https://t.co/RQ4BqdUkVy">pic.twitter.com/RQ4BqdUkVy</a></p>
