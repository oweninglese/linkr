<p>"This process has forever tarnished the image of the RCMP as a [[Canadian]] icon." </p>
<p>(The Honourable Michel Bastarache, Independent Assessor)</p>
<p>RCMP'S TOXIC CULTURE</p>
<p>[[Racism]], [[misogyny]] and homophobia - these are the characteristics of Royal 
[[Canadian]] Mounted Police (RCMP) toxic culture according to a new report released 
this week. </p>
<p>The report: Broken Dreams Broken Lives<a href="https://merlodavidson.ca/wp-content/uploads/RCMP_Final-Report_Broken-Dreams.pdf" title="link">3</a> was written by former Supreme Court of
[[Canada]] Justice Michel Bastarache, who had been engaged as an independent 
assessor to review the more than 3,000 claims of sexual harassment experienced 
by women who worked for the RCMP. He found that the experiences of these women 
in the RCMP were nothing short of devastating.</p>
<p>In addition to those women who suffered from violent sexual assaults by their 
male RCMP colleagues, many women have been left with deep psychological injuries
which range from major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder to
substance dependence and even suicide. Bastarache emphasized that “it is 
impossible to fully convey the depth of the pain that the Assessors witnessed” 
and that “no amount of financial compensation can undo the harm” these women and
their families experienced at the hands of the RCMP in all provinces and 
territories.</p>

<p>RCMP CULTURE EATS POLICY</p>
<p>The real tragedy is that none of this is news - not to the RCMP or the federal 
and provincial [[government]]s. All of them have known about this long-standing, 
widespread problem of [[racism]], [[misogyny]], homophobia and [[violence]] within the RCMP 
for many decades - through both internal and external reports and litigation. </p>
<p>The RCMP are a male-dominated, para-military organization whose powerful, toxic 
culture has prevailed despite internal policy changes. They are impervious to 
change because "Culture eats Policy every time". The RCMP are invested in the 
status quo and will not change.</p>
<p>“Indeed, there are strong reasons to doubt that the RCMP has this capacity or 
the will to make the changes necessary to address the toxic aspects of its 
culture.”</p>

<p>SEXUALIZED VIOLENCE</p>
<p>One of the most disturbing aspects of the Broken Dreams report is how male RCMP 
members and leaders saw women as "fresh meat" to be used and abused as they saw 
fit. Th</p>
<p>The stories told to the Assessors "shocked them to their core". In addition to 
"serious acts of penetrative sexual assaults", male RCMP from all over [[Canada]] 
engaged in horrific acts of sexual harassment and abuse including:</p>
<ul>
<li>unwelcome sexual touching,</li>
<li>men exposing their penises,</li>
<li>making degrading comments about women’s bodies, </li>
<li>humiliating name-calling,</li>
<li>spreading violent &amp; obscene pornography forcing women to watch it;</li>
<li>being handcuffed to men’s toilets and locked in cells,</li>
<li>leaving dildos and used condoms on their desks;</li>
<li>being accused of selling sex;</li>
<li>outing their sexual orientation without their consent; and</li>
<li>stalking and bullying by male RCMP demanding sexual favours from women.</li>
</ul>

<p>RCMP TARGETED INDIGENOUS WOMEN</p>
<p>The report details how the RCMP treated [[Indigenous]] women even more poorly than 
other women. </p>
<p>In addition to the humiliating and degrading behaviours experienced by other 
women in the RCMP, [[Indigenous]] women were also referred to as "squaw" and "smoked
meat" and “were, at times, forced to watch RCMP members treat other [[Indigenous]] 
people brutally.” </p>
<p>Their male RCMP colleagues took advantage of the fact that many of these 
[[Indigenous]] women were young and came from small or remote communities and were 
not accustomed to this type of toxic culture.</p>
<p>“[[Indigenous]] women, particularly those who had been abused as [[child]]ren, were 
preyed upon by their male colleagues for sexual favours.”</p>

<p>FEW BAD APPLES MYTH BUSTED</p>
<p>The RCMP has long relied on the "few bad apples" justification to protect their 
organization's status quo which has resulted in so much pain and suffering by 
women in the RCMP.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that RCMP members and leaders have long denied the systemic and
cultural nature of their [[racism]], [[misogyny]] and homophobia, this report found that
sexual harassment in the RCMP exists "at every level of seniority and in every 
geographic area of [[Canada]]" and is "deeply embedded in its culture". Even those 
members and leaders who are well-intentioned make choices to accept this culture
and stay silent on the injustices.</p>
<p>"The reality is, however, that even honourable members (and well-intentioned 
leaders) have been required to conform to (or at least accept) the underlying 
culture, which they have, for the most part, had to adopt in order to succeed in
their career. Those who do not accept the culture are excluded."</p>

<p>RCMP CANNOT BE FIXED FROM WITHIN</p>
<p>This report makes it very clear that the RCMP cannot be fixed from within. They 
simply refuse to acknowledge that there are significant problems that are 
systemic and deeply rooted within their culture.</p>
<p>Their toxic culture of [[racism]], [[misogyny]] and homophobia is "powerful and presents
an obstacle to change". Furthermore, “Financial settlements of class-action 
lawsuits will not change this culture”. The Assessors found that the RCMP "are 
invested in the status quo and will not likely want to make the necessary 
changes to eradicate this toxic culture".</p>
<p>In fact, many of the women that had been interviewed felt that there was no 
chance for reform within the RCMP and some suggested it was time that it be 
replaced. This is what many Black and [[Indigenous]] peoples have been saying for 
decades and why the calls for the RCMP to be abolished have grown stronger in 
recent years.</p>
<p>And finally, the report concluded that the RCMP are not able to either 
investigate or remediate these problems.</p>
<p>“These men were often not held accountable for their actions. Indeed, the 
Assessors were told that one tactic used by the RCMP to resolve complaints of 
sexual harassment was to promote and transfer these men.”</p>

<p>Inquiry Needed into Police Violence against [[Indigenous]] Peoples<a href="https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/inquiry-needed-into-police-[[violence]]-against-[[indigenous]]-peoples" title="link">19</a></p>
<p>WHAT'S NEXT?</p>
<p>It is clear from this report that the RCMP has neither the will nor the ability 
to address its toxic culture and its widespread sexualized [[violence]] within its 
ranks. </p>
<p>It must also be kept in mind that this is just one of many class actions against
the RCMP. The RCMP's toxic culture of [[racism]], [[misogyny]] and homophobia, together 
with widespread sexualized [[violence]], represents a major public safety issue for 
women generally, and especially for [[Indigenous]], Black and marginalized women and
girls.</p>
<p>We need [[Canadian]]s to call on [[Canada]] to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the books at the RCMP so we can hold those who preyed on women to 
  account;</li>
<li>Conduct an independent investigation into the RCMP's similar actions towards
  [[Indigenous]] peoples; </li>
<li>Make [[reparations]] to [[Indigenous]] peoples who have suffered from RCMP 
  harassment, over-arrests, [[racism]], brutality, sexualized [[violence]] and [[kill]]ings;
  and </li>
<li>Dismantle the RCMP once and for all.</li>
