<p>his friend, Wilson Price Hunt, he emphasized the fact that she rarely spoke.
"For you may rely upon it that nothing</p>
<p>can give greater comfort to a husband
than the satisfaction of having a wife
who is nearly mute."7 Women were also
expected to be pious, a trait that further</p>
<p>encouraged their submissiveness.
The behavior of the wives of laborers</p>
<p>came under particular scrutiny at this</p>
<p>time because working-class women</p>
<p>and [[Indian]]s were considered inher-</p>
<p>ently sexual. The common belief was
that they were capable of being virtuous
only if their activities were strictly regu-</p>
<p>lated. Consequently, Victorian society
exaggerated the importance of chastity</p>
<p>and virtue. A woman's chastity, and
hence her body, was not her own to con-</p>
<p>trol but the [[property]] of her father and
then her husband. The adherence of
women to the behaviors that identified

<p>The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company established Fort Nisqually as a fur-trading post in
[[1833]]. In [[1840]]-41 the [[company]] transferred the fort to the Puget Sound Agricultural
Company, which moved the post in [[1843]]. This map shows the two locations of the
fort and its outlying farms - Tlithlow, Old Muck, and [[New]] Muck - in relation to
