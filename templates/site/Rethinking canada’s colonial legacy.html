<p><strong>Abstract in English</strong><br />
The authors interrogate the geo-political power negotiations that<br />
contributed to the ideological construction of [[Canada]] as a nation. This<br />
article focuses especially on the connection with the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an<br />
colonial projects in the [[America]]s initiated over 500 years ago, along the lines<br />
of Latin [[America]]n decolonial thinkers. The myth of [[Canada]] as a benign,<br />
welcoming, generous, peace-keeping, multicultural nation and society is<br />
unsanitized and dismantled. [[Canada]]’s [[history]] is resituated in relation to<br />
the ideological organization of the world according to racialized, classist,<br />
and cultural Eurocentric colonial indicators, which have contributed to<br />
the historical realities of impoverishment, violent exploitation, racialized<br />
discrimination, and cultural genocide throughout the [[America]]s.<br />

<p>Present global migration crises, the volatile international<br />
environment of war and terrorism, growing tides of uninformed<br />
islamophobia, and the retrenchment of nationalist attitudes in<br />
the Global [[North]] signal a change in the seas in the ways peo-<br />
ples from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds relate to<br />
each other. Many in what is now [[Canada]] look to our neighbour<br />
south of the border and celebrate that the [[Canadian]] social<br />
context is not as politically or ethnoracially charged. Others<br />
contrast the [[history]] of Jim Crow law and segregation in the<br />
[[U.S.A.]] with the <em>Multicultural Act</em> , proudly and self-righteously<br />
claiming [[Canada]]’s attempt to incorporate ethnoracial cultural<br />
diversity as part of the nation’s identity and imaginary.<br />
It is our argument, however, that [[Canada]]’s ability to build<br />
a more inclusive society will depend on its capacity to accept<br />
responsibility for the ways in which [[racism]], xenophobia, and<br />
ethnocultural intolerance have shaped the national imaginary.<br />
We draw from the wisdom of decolonial scholars in the Global<br />
[[South]],^1 particularly from Latin [[America]], in order to interrogate<br />
how racialization continues to shape the way current social,<br />
cultural, political, and religious structures privilege the Euro<br />
Anglo sectors of [[Canadian]] society. Their work unmasks the<br />
fact that the colonial imperial projects initiated by [[Western]]<br />
[[Europe]]ans some five hundred years ago are responsible for the<br />
historical realities of impoverishment, violent exploitation,<br />
racialized discrimination, and cultural genocide throughout<br />
the [[America]]s. [[Indigenous]] scholars in what is now [[Canada]] have<br />
also confronted ideologies of [[multiculturalism]], for example,<br />
because of [[Canada]]’s failure to recognize the long-standing</p>
<p>(^1) It is important to note that many decolonial scholars are Latin [[America]]ns<br />
who reside and work in the [[U.S.A.]] but who emphasize that their place of<br />
enunciation is Latin [[America]]. It is also important to note that decolonial<br />
theoretical currents are part of a long-standing line of critical theoretical<br />
articulations in Latin [[America]] which include critiques to notions of devel-<br />
op[[mental]]ism, dependency theoretical frames, and [[liberation]] discourses.<br />

<p><code>[[history]] of [[colonialism]] which goes back five hundred years.
Their work has already made significant contributions to
exposing [[Canada]]’s racialized [[history]] of discrimination against
[[Indigenous]] communities. Our approach is to also highlight
how the [[Europe]]an project of imperial expansion and colonial-
ism has had direct implications for many of the communities
that have made [[Canada]] their home since contact. Our inten-
tion here is to build on existing critical work by exa[[mining]]
this [[history]] through the lens of this larger colonial project. We
also acknowledge that [[Canada]]’s role as colonial power is com-
plicated by the dual character of its colonial status; both as
a colonial power, an extension of [[Europe]], and as a colonized
nation, an object of [[Europe]]an and [[U.S.A.]] colonial desire.
At the outset, we argue that the complex and multiply
diverse ethnoracial and cultural contexts of [[Canada]] do not eas-
ily fit into the paradigms of postcolonial scholars, but are better
suited to decolonial frameworks. Let us consider why. Both
intellectual currents display orientations which emphasize and
discuss different locations, periodization, mechanisms, and
expressions of colonial power. With few exceptions, postco-
lonial thinkers focus geographically on Asia as the object of
the colonial imperial gaze and activity.^2 In contrast, decolonial
scholars focus on the [[America]]s as the location for the colonial
expressions with which they engage. Postcolonial scholars take
the Enlightenment as the point of reference for analyzing both
“modernity” and colonization, whereas decolonial thinkers
trace modernity and the emergence of [[colonialism]] as far back
as [[1492]]. In other words, there is a difference of periodization.</code></p>
<p>(^2) Fernando Coronil is a good example of a postcolonial thinker whose work<br />
focuses on Latin [[America]], specifically Venezuela. Similarly, Latina/o theo-<br />
logian [[May]]ra Rivera uses postcolonial theory and continental philosophy<br />
to engage her Latina/o context. Others who have engaged postcolonial<br />
scholarship, especially in the theological realm, are really reconfiguring lib-<br />
eration philosophy and [[theology]]. See (Rivera, [[2007]]) and (Coronil, [[2004]]).<br />

<p>Methodologically speaking, postcolonial scholars focus their<br />
attention on the colonial gaze; it is the colonial subject that<br />
figures prominently in their writings. Meanwhile, decolonial<br />
thinkers look to those outside of the colonial centres of power.<br />
It is the colonized, the others of [[empire]], that receive greater<br />
attention. In other words, there is a difference of orientation<br />
and directionality in each current. Similarly, postcolonial schol-<br />
ars, with notable exceptions, focus particularly on issues of<br />
representation and the imposition of [[Western]] imperial episte-<br />
mologies. They draw from [[Europe]]an post-structuralist thinkers,<br />
remaining circumscribed by the very [[Europe]]an intellectual<br />
frames which they critique.^3 In contrast, decolonial scholars<br />
aim at reclaiming the epistemic traditions of the colonized (See:<br />
Mignolo, [[2009]]). They undertake a rejection of epistemic tradi-<br />
tions rather than an interrogation of the epistemologies of the<br />
centre.^4 Finally, and more funda[[mental]]ly, postcolonial scholars<br />
zero-in on coloniality as encompassing cultural imperialism,<br />
while decolonial scholars emphasize coloniality as a force lead-<br />
ing to: the violent genocidal eradication of the peoples and their<br />
cultures; the enslavement of entire communities; and enormous<br />
people movements (migration) as mechanisms for colonization<br />
(Quijano, [[2000]]). Decolonial scholars also consider that colo-<br />
niality is part and parcel of the present multiple globalizing<br />
forms of capitalism. Coloniality is then manifested not only as<br />
an imposed cultural force, but as encompassing all aspects of<br />
human existence for all those involved; it embodies a colonial-<br />
ity of power (Quijano, [[2000]]) and imposes a critical apparatus<br />
within which the [[Europe]]an intellectual tradition is celebrated</p>
<p>(^3) For example, it is commonly known that postcolonial scholars draw from the<br />
work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, among others.<br />
(^4) We are well aware of the Eurocentric character of the language of epistemol-<br />
ogies. Among many decolonial scholars, there is a privileging of the notion of<br />
<em>saberes</em> which incorporates a wide range of approaches by which peoples con-<br />
struct knowledge that includes their wisdom traditions. See (Walsh, [[2007]]).<br />

<p><code>as the highest expression of human advance/achievement and
patterns of behaviour. These differences put on display a rich
conversation between these two currents that needs to be had
in greater detail at another time. But by contrasting postcolo-
nial and decolonial thinking, and while recognizing their crucial
points of intersection, we have begun to show how decolonial
thinking is more appropriate for our purposes.
[[Indigenous]] intellectuals, scholars, artists, and activists in
what is now [[Canada]] have already made enormous contributions
to these debates.^5 We are also well aware that there are many
initiatives, movements, and projects in [[Canada]] and elsewhere
that are not self-perceived as “decolonial” or self-described with
decolonial language along the lines of Latin [[America]]n decolonial
thinking, but which follow in the spirit of this thematic direction.
In what follows, then, it is our intention to complement these
perspectives by showing how decolonial thinking can bring cru-
cial insights to the context of [[Canada]]. In [[alliance]] with [[Indigenous]]
scholars and others, we begin by affirming that the construction
of [[Canada]] as a nation is directly related to the events that began
in [[1492]]. The ways in which colonial forces engaged [[Indigenous]]
communities encompassed: strategic attempts to dislocate them
from their lands, orchestrated moves toward their eradication
by way of military force (genocide), and organized attempts to
destroy their cultures and religious traditions (culturecide, e.g.
residential schools). The [[history]] of the First Nations, Métis, and
Inuit peoples is violently inscribed in [[Canada]]’s invader-settler
[[history]]. Secondly, [[colonialism]] in [[Canada]] introduced complex
power-plays beyond the moment of first contact, including in his-
torical conflicts between English- and [[French]]-speaking sectors of
the country as well as in subsequent waves of immigration, the
effects of which we continue to feel even today. In other words,
the construction of [[Canada]] as a nation is intrinsically connected to</code></p>

<p>the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an colonial project in the [[America]]s; [[Canada]]’s<br />
[[history]] and formation as a nation, in order to be understood<br />
properly, needs to be resituated within this [[America]]n continental<br />
experience of [[colonialism]]. In the context of [[Canada]], [[colonialism]]<br />
meant the domination of the colonized “other.” On one hand,<br />
[[Canada]] needs to come to terms with the very structures of col-<br />
onization which continue to disproportionately benefit specific<br />
sectors of the Euro-[[Canadian]] population. On the other hand,<br />
[[Canada]] will also have to confront its multicultural façade which<br />
claims that official [[multiculturalism]] celebrates diversity without<br />
prejudice when in fact it actually excludes those who do not fit<br />
the dominant/normative Euro-[[Canadian]] frame.<br />
Our work comes out of our experiences as a Latino-[[Canadian]]<br />
immigrant and a [[white]] [[Canadian]] settler. Our identities<br />
embody the complex strands of interwoven stories in relation<br />
to these histories and experiences of coloniality. Between us<br />
and in different yet interconnected ways we have experienced:<br />
the pervasiveness of [[colonialism]] in political, social and racial-<br />
ized realities; the destructive effects of [[colonialism]] as part of<br />
the long-standing [[history]] of the construction of [[Canada]] as a<br />
nation; and the hope of working across difference to build rela-<br />
tionship and community. We have engaged these issues in the<br />
academy, in the churches, in various community settings, and<br />
in a variety of artistic collaborations. It thus rises out of our<br />
communities of engagement and reflects the ongoing conver-<br />
sation between us about these issues.</p>

<p>[[Canada]]’s inability to deal with diverse cultural groups is<br />
certainly not new. There is a long-standing [[history]] of racialized<br />
and xenophobic attitudes in [[Canada]]. Such racialized atti-<br />
tudes, however, are part of a larger complex of international</p>

<p><code>and geopolitical colonializing power relations. To be able to
understand present racialized configurations and their con-
crete structures and expressions in [[Canada]], it is necessary to
situate them within the context of the global colonial project.
Such a move requires an unmasking of the geo-political power
negotiations that have contributed both to the construction
of the [[Canadian]] nation-state and the historical imaginary of
[[Canada]]. These constructions have by-and-large contributed to
the myth of [[Canada]] as a benign, welcoming, generous, peace-
keeping, multicultural nation, almost a utopic example for the
rest of the world to look towards. At the same time, [[Canada]]
has functioned and has seen itself, in many ways, as an exten-
sion of [[Europe]], as part of the [[British]] Empire. On both counts,
[[Canada]] has succeeded in postponing having to deal with its
own racist [[history]], and, as a result, [[Canadian]]s have not had to
deal substantively with the underside of their colonial past.^6
On the flip side, [[Canada]]’s trajectory as a nation may also be
clearly understood as one of the locations for the realization of
the colonial project. It is an object of colonial desire—its land
to be extracted and settled and its peoples to be invaded and
[[conquer]]ed as part of the story of the “discovery” and [[conquer]]-
ing of the [[America]]s (Medina, [[2017]]).
Latin [[America]]n decolonial scholars describe the con-
ceptual framework that subsumes the co-constitutive axes
of [[colonialism]], modernity and capitalism as coloniality.
They understand “coloniality,” including the modern/
colonial capitalist world-system, as the systemic residue of</code></p>
<p>(^6) One exceptional case which has taken centre stage recently is the Truth<br />
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) process in relation to residential<br />
schools for [[Indigenous]] peoples in [[Canada]]. It remains to be seen, however,<br />
how many of the recommendations from the TRC will be implemented.<br />
Furthermore, the TRC and the processes that led up to it have not led to<br />
the recognition of the broader [[history]] of exercising colonial power over<br />
other ethnocultural groups.<br />

<p>[[colonialism]] and its ongoing manifestation in present glo-<br />
balizing, neoliberal systems.^7 Decolonial scholars, along<br />
with some cultural theorists and anthropologists, insist<br />
that “modern” [[history]], and especially the “success” and<br />
“superiority” of [[Europe]]an culture/modernity, can only be<br />
understood if the conquest of the [[America]]s, [[plantation]]<br />
[[slavery]] and the emergence of globalizing forms of capital-<br />
ism are understood as co-constitutive.^8 In addition, they<br />
argue that the claim of modernity’s success and the self-<br />
proclaimed superiority of [[Europe]] must be interrogated<br />
from the perspective of the peoples upon whom moder-<br />
nity was built and [[Europe]]an “civilization” was imposed,<br />
in other words, from the perspective of the vanquished<br />
(Dussel, [[1995]]).</p>
<p>(^7) Nelson Maldonado-Torres distinguishes between [[colonialism]] and coloni-<br />
ality, asserting that “[[colonialism]] denotes a political and economic relation in<br />
which the [[sovereignty]] of a nation or a people rests on the power of another<br />
nation, which makes such nation an [[empire]]. Coloniality, instead, refers to<br />
long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of [[colonialism]],<br />
but that define culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge pro-<br />
duction well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations” (Nelson<br />
Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]], 70, 242).<br />
(^8) Decolonial scholars use Immanuel Wallerstein’s notion of the modern<br />
world-system, expanding it to include the reality of coloniality, thus “the<br />
modern-colonial world-system.” (Mignolo, [[2000]], 18). Decolonial perspec-<br />
tives also put forth similar arguments to those by cultural theorists like<br />
scholars Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, but they differ radically in their focus.<br />
Paul Gilroy, for instance, in <em>The Black [[Atlantic]]</em> , argues that Anglo Euro-[[North]]<br />
[[America]]n modernity and its capitalist systems and exploits cannot be<br />
accurately considered without acknowledging the essential centrality and<br />
barbarity of [[plantation]] [[slavery]] in modernity’s inception and fabric. (Gilroy,</p>
<p>[[1993]]. and (Hall, [[2000]], 184–227). By contrast, decolonial scholars empha-<br />
      size the [[Indigenous]] underside of [[Western]] [[Europe]]an “modernity” and<br />
      underscore more broadly the colonial foundation and character of [[Western]]<br />
      [[Europe]]an epistemologies. (See Dussel, [[1995]]).<br />

<p><code>We argue that [[Canada]], as a settler [[colony]]/nation which
emerged from the [[British]] and [[French]] invasions of the region,
is a product of this modern-colonial world-system. Despite this
reality, [[Canada]] remains largely outside theoretical post/deco-
lonial discourses; the issues, concerns and social implications
are still largely unengaged. The result has often been to view
[[Canada]] as not having any negative colonial [[history]], while [[Canada]]
itself continues to perpetuate an ongoing “denial and margin-
alization of [[Native]] people’s experience of [[colonialism]] as well
as of the invader-settler and immigrant experiences” (Brydon,
[[2004]], 173). Indeed, cultural realities in a [[Canadian]] context are
extremely complex, contested and [[flu]]id, shaped by a wide range
of dynamic, shifting and multiple identities often within the
same person or community. The resulting complexity is that
the “inherited identities as First Nations, Métis, [[Québec]]ois,
invader-settler, immigrant, or ‘ethnic’” are intricately interwo-
ven with the reality of coloniality (Brydon, [[2004]], 171).
Yet even these categories are problematic because they
are framed within the colonial understanding of identities as
finished products, which tends to undermine the complex pro-
cesses involved in the historical encounters of peoples. Identity
categories themselves function as mechanisms for population
control, aimed at keeping people within their identity silos,
which are organized hierarchically. Those people that stand
in-between ethnocultural traditions, because of pervasive
dominant colonial identity frameworks, are often forced to
deny the [[flu]]id and ambivalent ways in which they understand
themselves in public sphere. In the private sphere, however,
they continue to carve and negotiate creative, celebratory, and
often subversive social spaces which spill out into the public
sphere as well (Medina, [[2013]]).
Notions of national identity are no less contested, par-
ticularly in the context of [[Canada]] and its connections to the
[[Western]] [[Europe]]an colonial project. In the [[Canadian]] context,
the dominant imaginary denies [[Canada]]’s complicity with</code></p>

its connection to this colonial legacy. The colonial umbilical<br />
cord with [[Europe]] has not been severed. At the same time,<br />
there is a sophisticated ideological apparatus at play, by<br />
which [[Canada]] intentionally conceals its own colonial com-<br />
plicity through the creation of national myths.<br />
The preeminent myth that both perpetuates and hides<br />
[[Canada]]’s colonial legacy is the idea of [[multiculturalism]], as<br />
a utopic society and nation, in which the diversity of ethno-<br />
cultural identities is celebrated. Scholars range in the ways<br />
they understand-engage [[Canada]]’s policy of [[multiculturalism]].<br />
For example, Charles Taylor critiques the universal applica-<br />
tion of the idea of “human dignity” along with the idea of the<br />
universal worth of cultural traditions in [[multiculturalism]]. He<br />
claims that behind the affirmation of the universal worth of<br />
cultural groups is their homogenization under [[North]] [[Atlantic]]<br />
criteria (Taylor, [[1992]], 71). In contrast, Himani Bannerji cri-<br />
tiques the ideal of [[multiculturalism]] because it perpetuates the<br />
power differential between the official Euro-[[Canadian]] cultures<br />
and everyone else. As she puts it, [[multiculturalism]] advocating<br />
for “minorities” actually (re)inscribes their minoritized sta-<br />
tus (Bannerji, [[2000]]). From an [[Indigenous]] perspective, Glen<br />
Coulthard critiques the very idea of recognition politics as the<br />
basis for a transformation of the “colonial relationship between<br />
[[Indigenous]] people and the [[Canadian]] nation state.” He writes<br />
that “instead of ushering in an era of peaceful coexistence<br />
grounded on the ideal of <em>reciprocity</em> or <em>mutual recognition</em> , the<br />
politics of recognition in its contemporary liberal form prom-<br />
ises to reproduce the very configurations of colonialist, racist,<br />
patriarchal state power that [[Indigenous]] peoples’ demands for<br />
recognition have historically sought to transcend (Coulthard,<br />
2[[014]], 3). Other scholars also highlight the character of</p>

<p><code>[[multiculturalism]] as a tool to manage the population and struc-
ture [[Canadian]] society.^9
By perpetuating the myth of [[multiculturalism]] and its attend-
ing politics of recognition, attempts at unmasking ongoing
realities of [[racism]], xenophobia, and [[white]] supremacy are seen
as social maladies which [[Canadian]]s have already overcome.
As a result, people who raise concerns about these realities
are stigmatized as disgruntled and are accused of unearthing
issues that are part of a time long gone. Multiculturalism, then,
functions as the governing social imaginary which promotes
the idea that it is possible to construct a society where ethno-
cultural differences are welcome as long as minoritized people
learn to function within the scope of the dominant “[[white]]”
Euro [[Canadian]] (English- and [[French]]-speaking) culture(s),
including [[Indigenous]] peoples and all other “others.” Whiteness
remains the ubiquitous feature, framework, and point of
reference—though it is absent from the official rhetoric—and is
“synthesized into a national we,” which decides “on the terms of
[[multiculturalism]] and the degree to which multicultural others
should be tolerated or accommodated. This ‘we’ is an essential-
ized version of a colonial [[Europe]]an turned into [[Canadian]] and
the subject or the agent of [[Canadian]] nationalism” (Bannerji,
[[2000]], 42–43). The implication is that coloniality is constitu-
tive of [[Canada]] as a nation. Admittedly, [[Canada]] as a nation has
made some strides towards becoming a more hospitable nation
to [[Indigenous]] communities and diverse ethnocultural commu-
nities, including immigrants. Those changes, however, are not
the result of a commitment to the inclusion of different peo-
ples and cultures in the very fabric of [[Canadian]] culture, [[history]],
and imaginary. Rather, they have taken place because of the
struggles of [[Indigenous]] peoples and other ethnocultural com-
munities against the pervasive structures of discrimination.</code></p>

<h5>Unsanitizing [[Canada]]’s Legacy</h5>
<p>Re-situating [[Canada]], along the lines of Latin [[America]]n deco-<br />
lonial thinkers, within the broader colonial legacy affirms the<br />
fact that the [[British]] colonial impetus, English coloniality, is at<br />
the heart of the formation of [[Canada]] as a nation. The construc-<br />
tion of a positive self-understanding of [[Canada]] as proudly part of<br />
the [[British]] Empire, part of the [[British]] colonial commonwealth, is<br />
unmasked. Reestablishing [[Canada]]’s long [[history]] of colonial con-<br />
nections names the multiplicity of issues that come with its birth<br />
as a nation-state. It is rooted in the initial encounters with origi-<br />
nary peoples in the [[America]]s, post [[1492]], which became violent<br />
and resulted in the decimation of the [[Indigenous]] peoples, cul-<br />
tures, and traditions. Though first established as an outpost of<br />
colonial [[empire]], [[Canada]] was subsequently built and continues to<br />
be built by diverse and complex waves of immigration. These waves<br />
which continue even today have significantly impacted the ongoing<br />
formation of the country. However, along with the attempted eras-<br />
ure of the narratives of [[Indigenous]] peoples, the contributions of<br />
many of these groups remain absent from the dominant narrative<br />
of the nation building [[history]]. The retrieval of the multiple stories<br />
of the various waves of immigrants helps us see that [[Canada]] was<br />
not built by “[[white]]s” alone. It was and continues to be built on<br />
the backs of the “others” of the colonial project. Recognizing<br />
[[Canada]]’s multiple histories unhinges the [[Canadian]] story from<br />
the monocultural narrative of [[empire]].<br />
[[Canada]] as a nation did not really begin in [[1867]] with the<br />
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act. Rather, [[Canada]] is the result of<br />
long standing processes of colonization that date as far back<br />
as the arrival of the [[French]] and the [[British]] to the region and<br />
are connected to the larger [[Western]] [[Europe]]an imperial pro-<br />
jects initiated by the [[Spanish]] and Portuguese from [[1492]] on.<br />
Like the [[Spanish]] and Portuguese, although with marked dif-<br />
ferences, the [[French]] and the [[British]] imposed their ideas of<br />
civilization and cultural superiority upon [[Indigenous]] peoples.</p>

<p><code>On one hand, the [[Spanish]] and Portuguese used military
[[violence]] as strategies to annihilate and to displace [[Indigenous]]
peoples from their lands and to subdue [[Indigenous]] resistance.
On the other, the [[French]] and [[British]] began by negotiating
(though not without some acts of [[violence]]) and gradually
turned to systematic methods of cultural subjugation, includ-
ing but not limited to the violation of [[treaty]] agreements and
the residential school system. The relationship that the [[French]]
and [[British]] sought at first with [[Indigenous]] peoples was circum-
scribed by colonial structures. It was an uneven relationship; it
imposed the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an colonial rule-of-law to shape
the nature of the relationship in the form of [[treaties]], which
the [[Canadian]] [[government]] violated by reneging on its com-
mitment. Religion was a central part of the colonial project
throughout the [[America]]s as enculturated [[Europe]]an versions of
Christianity were forcefully imposed upon [[Indigenous]] commu-
nities. In [[Canada]], the civilizing thrust of Christianity eventually
contributed to the formation of the residential schools. The
complicity of the Christian religious establishment with the
[[government]]’s aim to control and civilize [[Indigenous]] peoples
cannot be overstated. All this is to say that the colonial project
reached into all dimensions of [[Indigenous]] life, including the
cultural, political, social, and the religious.
However, it would be a mistake to reduce [[Canada]]’s colonial
[[history]] to only the initial encounter with [[Indigenous]] people
and subsequent developments in policies of marginalization
and social exclusion like the [[Indian]] Act and the establishment of
reservations and the residential schools. What is now [[Canada]]
was also built and continues to be built by immigrants. Yet,
not all immigrants have been valued to the same degree, a fact
which is unmasked by considering the nation’s troubled [[history]]
in dealing with the diversity of its cultural groups. There are
many examples of discrimination including, among others: the
[[Chinese]] immigration Act ([[1923]]), also known as the [[Chinese]]
exclusion act; the use of indentured [[child]] labour from [[Britain]]</code></p>

<p>in the 19th century ([[British]] home [[child]]ren, the Bernardo chil-<br />
dren); the internment of Germans and Hungarian [[Canadian]]s<br />
during the first world war; the internment and confiscation of<br />
[[property]] of [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s during world war two; the dis-<br />
crimination against [[Africa]]n-[[Canadian]]s (Nova Scotia, [[1946]]);<br />
the rabid Jewish antisemitism in [[Quebec]] in the second half of<br />
the twentieth century; and the importing of domestic and tem-<br />
porary/seasonal workers from the Caribbean, the Philippines,<br />
and Latin [[America]] among other places from the [[1950]]s to the<br />
present day.<br />
Two important insights can be gleaned from this list.<br />
First, the notion of “[[white]]ness” does not point to a homo-<br />
geneous group as can be seen by the discriminatory policies<br />
directed towards “[[white]]” poor/orphaned [[British]] [[child]]ren<br />
and the internment of Germans, Hungarians and [[Italian]]s,<br />
for instance. Whiteness is a chameleon-like social, politi-<br />
cal, economic construction of ethno-cultural identity tied<br />
to the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an racialized colonial apparatus and<br />
designed to exclude and assimilate. Second, [[white]]ness oper-<br />
ates as a normative value system that establishes hierarchies<br />
among ethnic groups. As a result, people from groups who<br />
are racialized tend to fare worse in the long run. Furthermore,<br />
it almost goes without saying that [[white]]ness, like any<br />
other discriminatory structure, is compounded when other<br />
identity markers, like gender, class, dis/ability, education,<br />
nationality, sexual orientation, age, accent, and other factors<br />
are taken into account. Decolonial thinkers remind us that<br />
even these categories are marked by the fact that they have<br />
been constructed within [[Western]] [[Europe]]an epistemological<br />
framing.^10</p>
<p>(^10) Suffice it to say a fuller analysis of the implication of these questions is<br />
too large for discussion here. See for example (Walsh, [[2007]]) and (Medina,<br />
[[2018]]).<br />

<p><code>The ugly colonial [[history]] of [[Canada]] is intricately woven with
(cultural and ethno-racial) [[white]]ness as the preferred (predomi-
nant) Eurocentric norm for all its inhabitants. Set in place are
social structures and a historical imaginary designed to continu-
ally reinforce [[Canada]]’s colonial identity. As Celia Haig-Brown
argues, “simple binary distinctions... fail to address the range
of ways that people are a part of this country” (Haig-Brown, [[2009]],
14). Though all immigrants are implicated in processes of colo-
nization, they are not all implicated in the “same ways as those
who came with the clear intention of exploitation and profit.
Many people came for better lives, to escape war and famine, to
seek freedom, to start anew” (Haig-Brown, [[2009]]). People come
to [[Canada]] for a number of different reasons: as political and eco-
nomic refugees, as s[[kill]]ed labour, as investors. But [[Canada]] also
exercises its power to entice immigrants and temporary workers,
while preventing them from becoming actual residents in the
country. These dynamics are part of the way in which colonial
economic power is played out in and by [[Canada]].
Unsanitizing [[Canada]]’s [[history]] confronts this “historical con-
text of the founding and grounding [[violence]] of the [[Canadian]]
state—[[violence]] directed toward many immigrant and enslaved
peoples, as well as toward [[Indigenous]] peoples” (Shotwell, [[2015]],
65).^11 It unmasks our colonial legacy and exposes the utopic myth
of [[Canada]] as a benign multicultural nation. Everyone’s presence
in [[Canada]] is touched by coloniality. It is our collective [[history]].
And it is a [[history]] by which some of us have benefited greatly</code></p>
<p>(^11) For Shotwell, a process of “unforgetting,” especially for [[white]] Anglo<br />
[[Canadian]]s, who benefit from [[white]] systemic privilege, is necessary in order<br />
to combat the “colonial status quo [which] involves truly vast apparatuses<br />
and histories” (65). She notes that a “central feature of [[white]] settler colo-<br />
nial subjectivity is forgetting; we live [[white]]ness in part as active ignorance<br />
and forgetting” (58). She also notes that “unforgetting” is only effective<br />
when it is coupled with a commitment to action “to craft a future different<br />
than the horrific past we have inherited and live in the present” (58).<br />

<p>in terms of wealth and status, while others—those condemned<br />
( <em>damnés)</em> to the colonial underside—have experienced oppres-<br />
sion, impoverishment, [[racism]], [[violence]] and even [[death]] (Fanon,<br />
[[1963]]). Colonial power structures depend on a wide range of fac-<br />
tors, codes, and processes in which [[white]]ness has been one of<br />
the most salient features. More recently though, with the open-<br />
ness to immigration from countries of the Global [[South]], class<br />
and education have gained greater importance. The chameleon<br />
changes its colours to ensure that the colonial apparatus stays<br />
intact through coloniality, in whatever form it needs to take.<br />
This operative colonial power matrix which includes social<br />
and cultural [[white]]ness, among other things, shapes society and<br />
includes our sources of knowledge and ways of being which<br />
are part of what decolonial scholars articulate more broadly<br />
as a “coloniality of being” and “coloniality of knowledge”<br />
(Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]]; Walsh, [[2007]]). Nelson Maldonado-<br />
Torres writes that the interconnected forces of colonial power<br />
impact our intersubjective relations as we come to grips with<br />
the “effects of coloniality in lived experience and not only in<br />
the mind” (Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]], 242). In other words,<br />
coloniality shapes and prescribes the way individuals ought to<br />
behave in a society. He argues that a coloniality of being “is<br />
maintained alive in books, in the criteria for academic perfor-<br />
mance, in cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image<br />
of peoples, in aspirations of self, and so many other aspects<br />
of our modern experience. In a way, as modern subjects we<br />
breathe coloniality all the time and every day” (Maldonado-<br />
Torres, [[2007]], 243).<br />
Maldonado-Torres proposes a number of strategic possibilities<br />
for decolonization including: borrowing from Fanon—receptive<br />
generosity in which “racialized subjects could give and receive<br />
freely;” suspending one’s identity and offering “one’s life to the<br />
task of achieving decolonial justice;” dialogue and exchange;<br />
confronting the “racial, gender, and sexual hierarchies that were<br />
put in place by [[Europe]]an modernity as it colonized and enslaved</p>

<p><code>populations throughout the planet;” and opposing the paradigm
of war (Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]], 60–62). However, Maldonado-
Torres’ insightful proposal is less help in the context of [[Canada]]
where the notion of [[multiculturalism]] is deployed paradoxically
both as a tool to celebrate diversity and as a mechanism for rein-
scribing the inherited [[white]] Anglo [[North]] [[Atlantic]] mode of being
as normative. In our view, Nelson-Maldonado’s proposal runs
the risk of romanticizing the work of decolonization but leaves
unchallenged the subtle, complex and hard to detect mechanisms
of coloniality. Taking these factors into account, we argue that,
in the context of [[Canada]], coloniality of being not only affects our
sense of personal and community identity as we have articulated
them, but also impacts that way [[Canadian]]s understand them-
selves as a nation.</code></p>
<h5>[[Canada]] as the Subject and Object of Colonial</h5>
<h5>Desire</h5>
<p><code>[[Canada]]’s geopolitical position and status in the global mar-
ket allows it to become an instrument of colonial power both in
its internal and external capacity to act on smaller players, but
also to be acted upon, by the [[U.S.A.]] and [[Britain]], for example. It
is for this reason that any consideration of the present [[Canadian]]
context necessitates an evaluation of the ways in which [[Canada]]
aspires to function in the global scene imitating present global
economic and military powers. As we have been arguing, [[Canada]]
is marked by coloniality through and through and needs to be
understood as located in the [[America]]s, historically, geo-politically
and culturally. At the same time, we wish to show that while
[[Canada]] participates in the colonial project and benefits from the
present geopolitical configuration, it simultaneously occupies
an in-between identity space as a nation in which it displays
elements of being a colonized society as well. In the larger
interconnected web of historical and present-day colonial pow-
ers, [[Canada]] is both a subject and object of colonial desire.</code></p>

<p>[[Canada]] is the subject of colonial desire because it strategi-<br />
cally draws from patterns of behaviour by more powerful actors<br />
which continue the legacy of [[Western]] [[Europe]]an [[North]] [[Atlantic]]<br />
imperialism, especially the [[U.S.A.]] and [[Britain]]. It adopts colo-<br />
nizing strategies that seek to reproduce this behaviour in order<br />
to organize itself as a society and as a way to participate in the<br />
larger global theatre. It is not difficult to see how [[Canada]] tai-<br />
lors itself after these countries. For example, former [[Canadian]]<br />
Prime Minister Stephen Harper mimicked a [[U.S.A.]]-style<br />
presidency by limiting “his access to the media, keeping some-<br />
thing of a distance, [and] controlling what would be known<br />
and said,” making a show of his trip to Afghanistan, invoking<br />
the Christian God in a [[U.S.A.]]-style “God bless [[Canada]],” and<br />
staging the speech from the throne more as a media-hyped<br />
State of the Union-style address (Haberman, [[2006]]). According<br />
to Arthur Harberman, this behaviour of Harper’s in which<br />
he acted like the [[U.S.A.]] head of state violated the [[Canadian]]<br />
[[parliament]]ary approach in which he is rather the head of a<br />
party and a Member of Parliament, like all the other Members,<br />
responsible to the [[Crown]] as head of state. Of course, there is a<br />
significant irony in the fact that [[Canada]]’s head of state is still<br />
the [[Queen]] of England.<br />
This aspiration towards [[Britain]] is exemplified in recent con-<br />
troversies related to the required swearing of the oath to the<br />
[[Queen]] at citizenship ceremonies. In a Globe and Mail article<br />
which documents the legal case of three would-be citizens who,<br />
for ethical and religious reasons do not wish to swear such an<br />
allegiance, argues in its favour, concluding that “The [[Crown]] is<br />
a powerful and historic symbol. Far from diminishing [[Canadian]]<br />
citizenship, it enhances [[Canada]]” (Globe and Mail, [[2017]]). Emer<br />
O’Toole, another would-be-[[Canadian]], writes in an op-ed for<br />
the Guardian that his socialist beliefs make the allegiance<br />
“anathema to my political con[[[[science]]]]; I’m baffled by otherwise<br />
egalitarian people who are okay with aristocrats inheriting the<br />
position of head of state.” O’Toole continues by articulating the</p>

<p><code>coloniality behind this symbolic gesture. He writes “As an [[Irish]]
person, I’m aware of the historical oppression of my people and
culture by [[British]] [[colonialism]]” (O’Toole, 2[[014]]).
In both instances [[Canada]]’s complicity with coloniality is
exposed and problematized. The [[U.S.A.]] and [[Britain]] function as
an idealized double-optic which continues to shape [[Canada]]’s
self-perception inside and outside. [[Canada]]’s imaginary (social,
political, economic, cultural, etc.. .) is governed by a type of
coloniality of being which simultaneously imitates and imposes
colonizing social behaviours. Of course, a fuller discussion
of the dynamics at play and the factors contributing to these
dynamics go beyond the scope of this article. Our examples
merely touch the surface of a much more complicated network
of historical, social, political, cultural, and economic factors
and issues that continue to shape [[Canadian]] self-perception
and from which [[Canada]] and [[Canadian]]s benefit enormously;
ability to travel overseas, level of and access to education and
wealth, [[health]]care, etc. However, they serve to illustrate how
the dynamics of coloniality operate even at the highest lev-
els of [[government]]. They also illustrate the profoundly cultural
nature of coloniality which permeates all levels of society and
inevitably has detri[[mental]] effects on entire sectors of the pop-
ulation, especially racialized peoples, in some of the ways we
have shown.
Conversely, [[Canadian]]s also find themselves existing in a
liminal space, vulnerable to [[U.S.A.]] and [[British]] colonializing
whims. [[Canada]] is looked at paternalistically as being a young
nation when compared to its progenitor/motherland, [[Britain]],
and is bullied by its older brother to the [[South]], the [[U.S.A.]] Alan
Lawson describes this position as being “suspended between
‘mother’ and ‘other,’ simultaneously colonized and coloniz-
ing” (Lawson, [[2004]], 155) and Lee Maracle writes that “we
are the grand[[child]]ren of an abusive industrial [[British]] parent”
(Maracle, [[2004]], 206). We do not have to go too far to find
examples in the political realm. As a constitutional monarchy</code></p>

[[British]] Empire and it resides under the shadow of the present<br />

of these two nations. Caught between, [[Canadian]]s find them-<br />

<h5>The Implications of Reading Coloniality in</h5>
<h5>[[Canada]]</h5>
<p>In our view, coloniality operates as a range of expressions<br />
in which [[empire]] manifests its power in very concrete ways<br />
that we are still experiencing. The present configuration of<br />
[[Canada]]’s imaginary along with its systems of education and<br />
its social, political, and economic structures are predicated on<br />
inherited colonizing frames which perpetuate the exclusion of,<br />
discrimination against, and [[violence]] towards those who have<br />
been and are othered in ongoing processes that began 500<br />
years ago. We affirm a decolonial stance which involves the<br />
undoing and unlearning of the strategies, approaches, meth-<br />
ods and tendencies that wittingly or unwittingly reproduce<br />
this coloniality in all its manifestations. It also involves a sys-<br />
tematic interrogation of the wide range of power structures,<br />
consumption, and profit-making which govern all human rela-<br />
tions. With others, we dare to confront [[Canada]]’s coloniality<br />
with all of its attendant discriminatory hierarchies, practices,<br />
and systems ([[racism]], sexism, etc.. .) “not [only] as regretful<br />
by-products of modern [[Europe]], but as part of the conditions<br />
that made... [[[Canada]]]... possible (Lander, [[2000]], 525).</p>

<p><code>According to Roxana Ng, racist, sexist, and xenophobic roots
“underpin the construction of [[Canada]] as a nation. This [[racism]]
began in [[Canada]] with the interventions of [[Europe]]ans convinced
of their superiority to [[Indigenous]] peoples” (Haig-Brown, [[2009]],
8). Engaging this inheritance and facing the fact that colonial-
ity is constitutive of [[Canada]]’s [[history]], [[Canada]]’s formation as a
nation, [[Canada]]’s identity as a nation-state, as well as the way
[[Canadian]]s understand themselves and each other in relation to
these factors, would involve a decolonial turn towards those who
inhabit the underside of coloniality. Himani Bannerji articulates
such a move, stating that “the possibility for constructing a radi-
cally different [[Canada]] emerge only from those who have been
“othered” as the insider-outsiders of the nation... They serve
to remind us of the [[Canada]] that could exist” (Bannerji, [[2004]],
297). This “other” [[Canada]] goes beyond a liberal recognition of
the others of Empire to include a reclaiming and celebrating of
other epistemologies—the forms of knowledge of [[Indigenous]]
peoples and other ethnocultural groups, a process which is
already underway, as we have seen. It confronts the fact that the
very way [[Canada]] has constructed its epistemologies is based on
[[Western]] [[Europe]]an rationalist Enlightenment thinking.^12</code></p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p><code>[[July]] 1, [[2017]] marked the moment of [[Canada]]’s deeply con-
tested 150th anniversary since confederation first took place. A
rich diversity of voices merged in the public sphere to mark the</code></p>
<p>(^12) According to Catherine Walsh, in our present context of “shifting geo-<br />
political knowledges,” the decolonial turn will include “a renovation and<br />
reconstruction of critical thought in ways that take into account the present-<br />
day relations between culture, politics, and economy, [and that] challenge the<br />
hegemony of Eurocentric perspectives, and promote dialogues and <em>thinking<br />
with</em> thought and knowledge ‘others’, including that of Afro and [[Indigenous]]<br />
social movements and intellectuals” (Walsh, [[2007]], 233).<br />

<p>occasion. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, a group of<br />
five “[[white]]” military men, self-described as “Proud Boys” who<br />
are “[[Western]] Chauvinists” disrupted a peaceful [[protest]] on<br />
[[Canada]] Day by Mi-kmaq ([[Indigenous]]) women in [[Halifax]], Nova<br />
Scotia, by yelling “this is a [[British]] Colony.” The women, who<br />
were honouring [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women<br />
were “trying to help, heal, and mourn” (Lagerquist, [[July]] 3,<br />
[[2017]]).^13 Other voices ran the gamut from romantically declar-<br />
ing that “at 150, [[Canada]] is a far better place, in a far better<br />
space than ever before — in a world that grows only worse,”<br />
to those who confronted the painful reality of [[racism]] and the<br />
difficulty of fitting in to the normative [[white]]-Anglo expecta-<br />
tions of “[[Canadian]]” identity (Cohn, [[2017]]; Jackson et al, [[2017]];<br />
Paradkar, [[2017]]). In the wake of the Truth and Reconciliation<br />
Commission and its recommendations, many [[Indigenous]]<br />
voices and allies called for [[[[protest]]s]] against the celebrations<br />
noting that [[Indigenous]] communities have little to celebrate<br />
(Saganash, [[2017]]; Morin, [[2017]]).<br />
Significantly and hopefully, as we cross the threshold of<br />
this 150th anniversary, even those who are inclined to be sen-<br />
ti[[mental]] and romantic admit that it is necessary for [[Canada]]<br />
to acknowledge our racialized and gendered violent and trau-<br />
matic past. For instance, powerful and compelling voices are<br />
calling on [[Canadian]]s and their [[government]] to take concrete<br />
steps towards tangible reconciliation, daring to contemplate<br />
the possibilities of constructing another [[Canada]], “for all of us,<br />
our first people and our most recently arrived people and those<br />
[[Canadian]]s yet to come” (Keenan, [[2017]]). We argue that this<br />
“other” [[Canada]] requires a task of decolonization which engen-<br />
ders the development of new attitudes towards all “others” of/<br />
in [[Canada]] and depends on building movements of solidarity,</p>
<p>(^13) Subsequent reports indicate that the military will remove the men from<br />
duty and training pending an investigation and called their actions deplor-<br />
able. (Lagerquist, [[July]] 4, [[2017]]).<br />

<p><code>[[alliance]], and resistance between [[Indigenous]] peoples, immi-
grants, racialized people, and allies. The ethnocultural mosaic
that “makes [[Canada]] great,” and was widely celebrated as the
nation turned 150, also has, as part of its historical narrative,
a legacy of exploitation, oppression, and genocide. The pres-
ence of such a rich ethnocultural diversity forces us to rethink
inherited forms of social and political organization that privi-
lege a small racialized sector of the country. It invites us to
reinvent social, political, intellectual, and economic structures
in ways that counter the various forms of coloniality while
seeking ways to make [[Canada]] accountable for its complic-
ity in the present forces of globalizing neoliberal capitalism.
Recognizing [[Canada]]’s rich diversity also means uncovering
the rich range of sources of human knowledge as well as cul-
tural and social resources with which to construct a national
intercultural imaginary of [[Canada]] as a welcoming home for
the many. It is time for [[Canada]] to confront the skeletons in its
closet, abandon the relics of imperialism and colonization, and
to decolonize itself by truly embracing all its peoples.</code></p>
