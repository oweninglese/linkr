<p>SETTLEMENT OF THE CLAIMS IN WASHINGTON OF
THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY AND THE PUGET'S
SOUND AGRICULTURAL COMPANY</p>
<p>The claims of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company and the Puget's</p>
<p>Sound Agricultural Company were first recognized by the [[United]]
[[States]] in the [[Treaty]] of [[1846]]1 between [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the [[United]]
[[States]], as negotiated and arranged by James Buchanan, Secretary
of State for the [[United]] [[States]], and Right Honorable Richard Pak-</p>
<p>enham, member of the [[British]] Privy Council and Envoy Extr
ordinary and Minister Plenitrotentiary to the [[United]] [[States]]. A
ticles II, III and IV are those in which the [[companies]]' claims ar
recognized by the [[United]] [[States]]. The articles are in substance
follows :</p>
<p>Article II. Free navigation, to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Cmpany, of</p>
<p>the Columbia River and its tributaries from point where the 49th
degree of latitude crosses the Grand Eddy, the great northern bran
of the Columbia, to the [[Pacific]] Ocean.</p>
<p>Article III. Confirmation of the possessory rights of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company south of 49°, within the territory of the Unite
[[States]].</p>
<p>Article IV. Confirmation to the Puget's Sound Agricultura</p>
<p>Company of farms, lands and other [[property]] belonging to the com</p>
<p>pany, north of the Columbia River and to the [[United]] [[States]] t</p>
<p>right to take it at a proper valuation to be agreed on between the
two parties concerned, if the [[property]] becomes of "public and po
litical importance to the [[United]] [[States]]."</p>
<p>From [[1848]] to [[1863]], when a [[treaty]] was made with England for
the settlement of the claims,2 many requests were made to Congre
to buy these possessory rights of the two [[companies]]. On [[July]] 10
[[1848]], Sir George Simpson, on behalf of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Compan
let it be known/ to [[Congress]] that the [[company]] was anxious to se
because of England's fear of disputes over the rights, which migh
lead to differences between the nations; hence, the [[company]] was
willing to sacrifice its rights for $l,000,000.3 In the same year, in
answer to a resolution of the Senate, on [[July]] 31st, [[President]] Polk</p>

the [[United]] [[States]] Government and the [[British]] [[Crown]].6 On [[October]]</p>
<p>11, [[1850]] Sir William Pelly wrote to Daniel Webster, Secretary of
State, to the effect that seizure by [[United]] [[States]] military officers
of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's vessel and store at Nisqually (really
the [[property]] of the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company, a [[company]] subsidiary to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company and often included
under the term Hudson's! [[Bay]] Company7) hastened the necessity for
transferring possessory rights to the [[United]] [[States]]; that part of
the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company's land was already occupied by [[United]] [[States]]' troops, so was of public and political importance to the [[United]] [[States]] ; that the purchase price was not so important and that it would be advisable to leave the price to the judgment of two parties, - one appointed by the [[United]] [[States]] and one</p>
<p>by the Hudson's [[Bay]] and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies,
who should call in a third party as umpire should they not agree.8
It is interesting to note that this was the plan later provided by the
[[Treaty]] of [[1863]].*
Twice the Legislature of Oregon Territory, on [[July]] 20, [[1849]]
and again [[January]] 6, [[1851]], sent memorials to [[Congress]] to purchase
the claims since the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company was resisting the efforts of [[America]]n settlers to locate on the unenclosed
lands10 to which the [[company]], according to the legislature, had no
right.11</p>
<p>The report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
[[November]] 26, [[1851]], mentioned the necessity of the Surveyor Gen-</p>
<p>eral of Oregon's obtaining from the [[companies]] evidence of the
rights they may claim to be protected by the [[Treaty]] of [[1846]] and evidence of the original localities and boundaries of the same, which

they held at the time of the [[treaty]]. The report recommended that
provision be made by [[Congress]] for "prompt summary and final adjustment of the said claims in order that all within the purview of
the [[treaty]] may be respected ; and the [[United]] [[States]] protected from
any not within its stipulations."12</p>
<p>The memorial of the [[Washington]] Legislature to [[Congress]] in
[[1854]] asked [[Congress]] to ascertain the rights of the [[company]] and to
purchase them, since the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company had
commanded [[America]]n settlers to vacate unenclosed lands over which</p>
<p>the [[company]]'s herds occasionally roamed, although these same
settlers had improved this land.13</p>
<p>[[Governor]] I. I. Stevens of [[Washington]] Territory, in [[1854]], said
that the [[company]] claimed the right of felling timber in the forests,
of grazing large tracts of unenclosed pasture and prairie land with
immense herds of cattle and flocks of sheep.</p>
<p>In his third annual message to [[Congress]], [[December]] 31, [[1855]],
[[President]] Franklin Pierce mentioned misunderstanding as to the extent, character, and value of the possessory rights of the Hudson's</p>
<p>[[Bay]] and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies and, to terminate
the question, advocated cession to the [[United]] [[States]] of the rights
of both [[companies]], which could be obtained at reasonable terms. He
asked for [[Congress]]' attention to the subject.14
On, [[August]] 14, [[1864]], A. G. Henry, Surveyor General of [[Washington]] Territory, evidently not having received news of the negotiating of the [[treaty]] of [[July]] 1, [[1863]], in a letter to J. M. Edmunds,
Commissioner of the General Landi Office, [[Washington]], D.C., called
attention to the necessity for a survey of the lands of the Puget's
Sound Agricultural "Society," at that time occupied by more than
one thousand settlers, many of whom had made large and valuable
improvements in the land. He added that the whole Territory was
annoyed by conflicts between the [[America]]n settlers and the [[company]]</p>
<p>and asked for prompt and decisive interference by the [[United]]
[[States]] [[government]].15</p>
<p>In answer to these many requests, came the [[treaty]] of [[July]] 1,
[[1863]], between [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the [[United]] [[States]], providing, since</p>
<p>it was desirable to transfer the [[companies]]' claims to the [[United]]
[[States]], for the appointment of commissioners by each country with12 Executive Documents 32nd C. 1st S. p. 7.

III. Possessory rights were of the value stated in the memorial.
IV. That the [[United]] [[States]] not only had failed to protect the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's rights but [[United]] [[States]] officers and citizens under authority of [[United]] [[States]] [[government]] had violated and
usurped them.
V. That the [[United]] [[States]] was now liable to the Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company for the highest value of the rights at any time between
[[1846]] and the producing of the claim in [[1865]], and that this value
ought to be the right amount to be awarded.22
After due consideration Commissioner Rose declared that he</p>
<p>was bound to adopt the conclusion that, since the functions of the
commissioners were limited to the third and fourth articles of the</p>
<p>[[Treaty]] of [[1846]], any right of navigation secured by article II of the
Oregon [[Treaty]] was beyond the jurisdiction of their commission.28
This left; only the question of the trading rights and the value of
the posts and establishments, for consideration by the Commission.
There was a great divergence in the acreage also in the valuation of the possessory rights as figured by the [[companies]] and by the
witnesses for the [[United]] [[States]], as well as differences in the valuation given by the [[companies]] at different dates. For example, the
Earl of Berens in a letter to the Earl of Clarendon in [[1857]], stated
that the assessor's books listed the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company's [[property]] at $670,000 ;24 in [[1865]] the [[company]] was claiming
$l,168,000.25 The possessory rights of this [[company]] principally included, according to its memorial to the Joint International Commission, a tract at Nisqually of 167,000 acres and a farm at Cowlitz River of about 3,572 acres. [[Governor]] I. I. Stevens of Washing-</p>
<p>ton Territory in a report, in [[1854]], to Secretary of State Marcy
valued the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company's rights, which included, according to the claims of the [[company]] in [[1854]], enclosed</p>
<p>and unenclosed pasture and prairie land to the amount of 8,000
acres for Cowlitz farm and 800 square miles for Nisqually territory,
at $180,000 and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's rights at $120,000 of</p>
<p>$300,000 for the entire claim.26 The $1,168,000 for the Puget's
Sound Agricultural Company, as quoted above, included $50,000 for

litz, Chinook, Okanagan, Colville, Kootanais and Flat-Heads were
still, in [[1865]], in the hands of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company.33</p>
<p>As to offers made before [[1865]], the [[United]] [[States]] offered to
pay $1,000,000 for the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's rights, including
the right to navigation of the Columbia. This was expressed in a</p>
<p>convention prepared by Daniel Webster in [[1852]].34 On the other
hand, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, through Mr. Lyons, in [[1860]]
agreed to accept $500,000 in full of their demands.34
Since the evidence of the claimant's witnesses made claims con-</p>
<p>siderably in excess of the sum the [[company]] was once ready to accept, and the evidence adduced by the [[United]] [[States]] reduced the
claims to an insignificant sum,34 Mr. Rose, anxious not to prevent
settlement,34 made the award $450,000 for the Hudson's [[Bay]] Com-</p>
<p>pany and $200,000 for the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company,
or $650,000 in all. The same award was made by Mr. Johnson.
The sum of $650,000 was to be paid by the [[United]] [[States]] to the
[[government]] of [[Great]] [[Britain]] as specified in the [[Treaty]] of [[1863]].
Before payment, or at the time of, each [[company]] was to deliver
to the [[United]] [[States]] a sufficient deed or transfer and release, the
form for which was annexed to the award. Thus the award was</p>
<p>made by the Joint International Commission on [[September]] 10,
[[1869]].35</p>
<p>On [[December]] 6, [[1869]], [[President]] Grant notified [[Congress]] of the
award, of the extinguishing of the titles and rights of the [[company]]
to territory in the [[United]] [[States]] and of the delivery of the deeds
for the [[property]] of this [[company]]; and asked for an appropriation
by [[Congress]] to meet the award of $650,000.36</p>
<p>On [[March]] 24, [[1870]], Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State called
the attention of George Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury, to the
fact that the first installment of the award would become payable on
[[September]] 10, [[1870]], according to the [[Treaty]] of [[1863]].37 Two days
later, the Secretary of the Treasury in a letter to James G. Blaine,
Speaker of the House, asked for an appropriation to pay this part
of the award.37 This was accordingly appropriated and the first installment paid by the [[United]] [[States]] as stipulated.38
