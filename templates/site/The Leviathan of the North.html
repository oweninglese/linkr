<p>"The Leviathan of the [[North]]"
[[America]]n Perceptions of the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, [[1816]]-[[1846]]</p>
<p>In the summer of [[1833]], while touring the Upper Missouri coun
try as a guest of Pierre Chouteau and the [[America]]n Fur Company
(AFC), the German prince Maximilian witnessed a series of extraor
dinary events. At Fort McKenzie, in the heart of Blackfeet country,</p>
<p>he was present when David D. Mitchell, the chief clerk at the fort, intro</p>
<p>duced Ninoch-Kiaiu, the Bear Chief of the Blackfeet Nation, who,
Maximilian recorded in his journal, "had always been very faithful and
devoted to the Whites and the Fur Company." Ninoch-Kiaiu wore "a new
uniform, half red and half green, with red and green facings, and trimmed
with [[silver]] lace; a red felt hat, ornamented with many tufts of feathers; in</p>
<p>short, a complete dress, and a new double-barrelled percussion gun."
Maximilian continued:
Mr. Mitchell wished particularly to distinguish this man [Ninoch-Kiaiu], because he
had never been to the north to [[trade]] with the [[Hudsons]] [[Bay]] Company. When he had
equipped himself in his new uniform, which was worth 150 dollars, and entered the
assembly of the chiefs in the court-yard of the fort, it immediately became evident</p>
<p>that the distinction conferred upon him made no favourable impression on them;
some chiefs who had made presents to Mr. Mitchell, and had not yet received any
thing in return?for instance, Mehkskehme-Sukahs, could not conceal their feelings;
the latter hid his head behind the person who sat next to him, while others hung down</p>
<p>their heads, and seemed lost in thought. When Mr. Mitchell perceived this, he caused</p>
<p>it to be intimated to the chiefs, that "they saw how the [[America]]n Fur Company</p>

<p>Astoria is depicted here in [[1813]], the year the [[America]]ns lost the fort to the [[British]]. Gabriel
Franch?re, who witnessed the transfer of Astoria to the [[North]] West Company, published the
sketch in his Narrative of a Voyage to the [[North]]west Coast of [[America]] in the Years [[1811]],
[[1812]],[[1813]], and [[1814]]. Astoria was restored to the [[United]] [[States]] in [[1818]].</p>
<p>distinguished its faithful friends; that they, on the contrary had generally taken their</p>
<p>beaver skins to the English; that he, therefore could not give them much now, but
would make every chief a present. That it would be [in] their interest to deal with him</p>
<p>in future, like Ninoch-Kiaiu, and then it would be in his power to make them more</p>
<p>considerable presents."1</p>
<p>Mitchell's strategy of favoritism exacerbated long-standing rivalries
and recent tensions among the [[Indian]]s who were present at Fort McKenzie
in the summer of [[1833]]. In [[August]], after a number of "violent disputes" had</p>
<p>erupted among [[Indian]] [[trade]]rs as well as among the hired engag?s, a [[white]]</p>
<p>employee named Martin was accidentally shot with a pistol by a Blood
[[Indian]] who had, "till that time, always conducted himself well," according</p>
<p>to Maximilian. The incident pitted [[Indian]] against [[Indian]]. Ninoch-Kiaiu
sided with the [[white]]s, who decided to execute the accused murderer. This</p>

<p>further embittered the Bloods, who determined
to seek vengeance at the appropriate time.2</p>
<p>For the remainder of the summer, [[Indian]]</p>
<p>bands of twenty to forty lodges each ?represent</p>
<p>ing the Blood (Kainai), Piegan (Pikuni),
"Sikesekai" (Siksikai or Blackfoot proper), and
their allies, the Gros Ventre ? appeared before
Fort McKenzie.3 As he struggled to keep [[violence]]</p>
<p>to a minimum, wooing Blackfoot [[trade]] away</p>
<p>from Hudson's [[Bay]] Company ([[HBC]]) hands,
Mitchell came to appreciate how little power the
[[America]]ns held in Blackfoot country. On [[August]]
14, a "half [[Indian]]" named The Bird arrived to find
only twenty-three lodges of Blackfeet remaining
at the fort. Maximilian described him as "a tall,
The seal of the [[North]] West</p>
<p>Company</p>
<p>strong man, with a brownish complexion,
[&amp;] thick black hair" who "spoke the language of</p>
<p>the Blackfeet perfectly and lived constantly
among them." He judged him to be a "treacherous, very dangerous man,
who had great in[[flu]]ence among the Blackfeet." The Bird had [[trade]]d with
and cheated both the AFC and the [[HBC]], and by then was a free agent who
"lived by catching beaver, and hunting, for his own account."4</p>
<p>Several days later, upon learning that the Bloods had ambushed and
[[kill]]ed his nephew while he was looking for his stolen horse near the fort,</p>
<p>the Bear Chief sent the corpse to Mitchell as a present and asked him "to</p>
<p>revenge his kinsman." After consulting a "sensible old [[Indian]]" who "ad
vised that this matter should not be treated as a concern of the whole tribe,</p>
<p>but as a private affair," Mitchell did nothing beyond properly seeing to
burial by Blackfeet custom.5 Maximilian recalled:
As the murder of the [[Indian]] was a consequence of the offence which Ninoch-Kiaiu
had offered to the Blood [[Indian]]s, on the occasion of Martins [[death]], the present could
not well be refused, and we were obliged to be very cautious how we left the fort, as the</p>
<p>Blood [[Indian]]s were hostiley [sic] disposed toward us.6</p>
<p>Mitchell feared the worst. In desperation, he requested The Bird to inter</p>
<p>cede in hopes of avoiding a blood bath. Maximilian would later record
this as a misjudgment:
many unfavourable reports were spread of the hostile disposition of Ninoch-Kiaiu
and his adherents toward the Whites, which had, doubtless, been excited by the
pernicious in[[flu]]ence of the treacherous Bird, who was prejudiced against the Com</p>

<p>pany. An [[Indian]] told us that his countrymen would demand double the usual price
for the beavers, and, if that were refused, they would [[kill]] all the [[America]]ns.7</p>
<p>What followed is the well-known incident that precluded a Piegan
Blood-White war at Fort McKenzie. On [[August]] 28, the twenty or so re
maining Piegan lodges outside the fort were surprised at daybreak by
around six hundred Assiniboins and [[Cree]]s. Men, women, and [[child]]ren fell</p>
<p>in their lodges, and both sides suffered casualties. Mitchell opened the
doors of the fort to take in the Piegan wounded and, in so doing, improved</p>
<p>his diminishing reputation and enabled the [[America]]n Fur Company to
remain in Piegan country. Plains [[Indian]] ethnologist John C. Ewers ana
lyzed the implications of the affair:
This [[battle]] brought to an end the Piegan-Assiniboin peace McKenzie had negotiated
at Fort Union less than two years before_Fearing the defection of the Piegans, the</p>
<p>Hudson's [[Bay]] Company had built Piegan [Peagan] Post on Bow River that very
summer. They hoped its more southerly location would attract the Piegans and
prevent the more northerly Blackfoot tribes from carrying their furs south to [[trade]]</p>
<p>with the [[America]]n on the Missouri.8</p>
<p>The [[HBC]] plan failed. After a short trial run, Peagan Post, located west
of present-day [[Calgary]] and also known as Old Bow Fort, was abandoned,</p>
<p>it being an "abundance of trouble and expense," in the words of Chief
Trader J.E. Harriott. More to the point, as historian Hugh A. Dempsey
has summarized, "the Blackfoot soon made it clear that they wanted the
[[white]] man's [[trade]] goods but they did not particularly want him. Peagan
Post survived a couple of hectic years, but by [[January]], [[1834]], it was evident</p>
<p>that the [[trade]]rs were not welcome, so they retreated to the muskegs of</p>
<p>Rocky Mountain House."9
Meanwhile, the [[America]]n Fur Company suffered a short-term loss
from increased international and inter-tribal strife. While [[HBC]] craftsmen</p>
<p>refitted old Rocky Mountain House for the much safer and more reliable
[[trade]] with the Blood [[Indian]]s, Kenneth McKenzie, Supreme Agent of the</p>
<p>Upper Missouri Outfit of the [[America]]n Fur Company, penned a letter
from Fort Union to Mitchell on [[January]] 21,[[1834]]:
Your beaver [[trade]] has certainly fallen very short of my expectations, but I will give you</p>
<p>the credit of getting every skin that could be obtained respecting the course you
pursued when the fort was attacked. I look to the motives which prompted you. They</p>
<p>were noble 8c evinced the purest &amp; strongest devotedness to my interest, what the
eventual result may be only time can determine but it is more than probable had I</p>
<p>been in your situation I should have done as you did. We can only regret that the
Leviathan [[company]] of the north have means so extensive &amp; goods so cheap [,] but</p>

<p>they will not drive me from my purpose, industry &amp; perseverance will overcome

<p>CKENZiE?a scot by birth and a former [[North]] West
Company clerk who had been released by the [[HBC]] in [[1821]]
at the time of the great merger of those two [[companies]] ?
was at the peak of his power in [[1834]]. Twelve years earlier,
this "[[King]] of the Missouri," as he became known, had struck out on his own
and entered the [[trade]] on the upper Mississippi.11 In [[1822]], while in St. Louis,</p>
<p>McKenzie became an [[America]]n citizen, a practical decision that gave him
legal license to compete with his "fellow [[America]]ns." Soon thereafter he</p>
<p>joined as a partner in Joseph Renville's Columbia Fur Company (also
known as Tilton and Company) and helped make it a success both in the
upper Mississippi country and on the middle stretches of the Missouri
River.12 By [[1826]] it had become apparent to the recently formed [[Western]]
Department of the [[America]]n Fur Company that McKenzie held the key to
expansion upriver into the potentially lucrative [[Indian]] [[trade]] of the north
ern Plains and Rockies.13
Affairs on the upper Missouri went fairly smoothly for McKenzie and</p>
<p>for the [[America]]n Fur Company up to [[1834]], but by year's end [[company]]
owner Pierre Chouteau, Jr., ordered him to return downriver. Both</p>
<p>McKenzie and the newly reorganized AFC needed a cooling-off period.
McKenzie had jeopardized the Company's license in the [[Indian]] [[trade]] for
distilling liquor at Fort Union, something he claimed he had to do to
compete successfully with the [[HBC]] after the [[1832]] [[congress]]ional ban on
dispensing alcohol to [[Indian]]s in their own country. In a letter to Chouteau
in [[March]] [[1834]], McKenzie explained:
After 20 years experience in the [[Indian]] [[trade]] I can safely declare that an entire prohi
bition of liquor if rightly enforced would be an almost incalculable relief to the [[trade]]r,
but you well know that the [[Indian]]s of this district from their proximity to the trading</p>
<p>establishment of the H.B.C. have always been accustomed to the use of liquor, &amp; it is</p>
<p>by no means extraordinary that they should seek to be supplied therewith when
making their [[trade]] on this side of the line. I am well convinced that if I had liquor I
could extend the [[trade]] very considerably but having none I do the best I can.14</p>
<p>McKenzie left the [[trade]] for a vacation in [[Europe]] and other business
pursuits. Although he lost the inertia of personally competing with his old
rival, the [[HBC]], events of the [[1830]]s proved him right on the need for high</p>
<p>quality, relatively inexpensive [[trade]] goods and sufficient liquor, guns, and
ammunition where tribes demanded such. McKenzie also understood, as</p>

<p>most diplomats did not, that international boundaries or trading agree
ments drawn by and for Euroamerican nations mattered not to [[Indian]]
hunters and their families. What counted was receiving full measure in
goods and proper protocol for delivering furs and robes. In the trading
year of [[1834]]-[[1835]], only a year removed from Martin's [[death]] and the as
sault by the [[Cree]]-Assiniboin war party, Fort McKenzie's returns amounted
to 9,000 buffalo robes, 180 wolves, 200 red foxes, 2,800 muskrats, 19 bear
skins, 1,500 prairie dogs, and 1,020 beaver pelts.15 Fort McKenzie remained
an active post wedged in the heart of Blackfoot country until [[1844]], when it</p>
<p>was abandoned and later burned. During its fourteen-year tenure, only
four [[America]]n Fur Company personnel were [[kill]]ed by local Blackfeet, and
those men, John Ewers believed, "may have deserved their fate because of
their own misconduct."l6</p>

<p>Historians of the fur [[trade]] were quick to pick up the two themes that
surface from the incidents at Fort McKenzie in [[1833]] and [[1834]]. Hiram M.</p>
<p>Chittenden, an engineer who spent much of his career with the Army</p>
<p>Corps designing dams and locks on the Missouri and Columbia rivers,
turned historian in his spare time and wrote the seminal study in the field.</p>
<p>In his in[[flu]]ential, The [[America]]n Fur Trade of the Far West, published in</p>
<p>[[1902]], Chittenden devoted an entire chapter to "The Liquor Traffic" and
another to "The Stress of Competition." E.E. Rich's comprehensive [[history]]</p>
<p>of the [[HBC]], published in i960, contains a parallel chapter on [[America]]n
opposition. Paul Phillips, LeRoy R. Hafen, and David J. Wishart repeated</p>
<p>these highlights to the point that competition for trading spheres and
in[[flu]]ence among the Blackfoot and the Assiniboin became stock subjects
in surveys of western [[North]] [[America]]n [[history]]. Most surveys also include</p>
<p>sections on the Blackfeet "threat" or "menace" to trappers and [[trade]]rs
active in the northern Rocky Mountains. Occasionally, this resistance is</p>
<p>attributed to [[America]]n trespass, but more commonly Blackfeet opposi
tion to [[America]]ns is interpreted as [[British]]-induced [[violence]] to protect</p>
<p>market-share and [[trade]] territory. Recently, Eugene Y. Arima and David
Smythe, ethnohistorians with Parks [[Canada]], independently revisited the</p>
<p>subject, providing valuable international context for [[Indian]]-[[white]] rela
tions, and historian John C. Jackson has recast the story of the Blackfeet in</p>
<p>the nineteenth century as "a culture under siege." v
What has been neglected in these discussions is a consideration of Ameri</p>
<p>can attitudes toward the [[HBC]] during the height of its expansion in the
region the [[British]] and [[Canadian]]s called "Columbia." Despite shared Anglo
and [[French]] heritage, [[America]]ns ? even those deeply involved in the fur
[[trade]] ? knew little about their northern neighbors. The exceptions were
businessmen whose livelihoods were directly affected by monetary or dip
lomatic agreements, but even then sensationalism during this age of ex</p>
<p>pansionist rhetoric conditioned popular opinion.18
In addition to Kenneth McKenzie, [[New]] Yorker John Jacob Astor and
[[New]] Englander Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth were notable examples. Astor used</p>
<p>connections and in[[flu]]ence on both sides of the international boundary
and was pragmatic in using combinations with foreign [[companies]] to op
erate a truly [[North]] [[America]]n, international enterprise. The [[South]] West</p>
<p>Company ? a joint [[America]]n and [[Canadian]] venture ? was organized
for this purpose in [[1811]] and was very successful in the [[Great]] Lakes up to
[[1816]]. His plan was set back by the [[War]] of [[1812]] and the loss of Astoria in [[1813]]</p>
<p>to the [[British]]. In [[1818]], after three years of closed-door discussion in Lon
don, Astoria was restored to the [[United]] [[States]] on the technicality that it</p>

<p>OrHi54</p>
<p>had been taken by a [[British]]
naval expedition during the
recent war, therefore quali
fying it for restitution under</p>
<p>the [[Treaty]] of Ghent. Despite
Astor's persistent efforts for</p>
<p>restoration through his</p>
<p>friend Albert Gallatin and</p>
<p>many in [[Congress]], the
[[America]]n Fur Company
flag was not to fly again over
the site because Astor's men</p>
<p>had openly sold the fort
prior to its formal seizure.
In [[1832]], two years before re</p>
<p>tiring from the fur [[trade]],
Astor reflected on his deci
sion to sell out to the [[North]]</p>
<p>West Company and to
abandon the Columbia
country. He wrote his old
friend Wilson Price Hunt:
"Had we succeeded in keep [[New]] Yorker John Jacob Astor was a pragmatic</p>
<p>businessman who used his connections and in[[flu]]ence to</p>
<p>ing Astoria, ere now we make his [[Pacific]] Fur Company an international</p>
<p>should all have made great</p>
<p>fortunes there, and even</p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>more and much more than the Hudson [[Bay]] Company now do."19
In the wake of the [[War]] of [[1812]], international policy shifts necessitated</p>
<p>new paradigms in [[America]]n fur-[[trade]] interests throughout the West. The
[[1794]] [[Treaty]] of London (Jay's [[Treaty]]), which had allowed [[British]] and Ca
nadian agents to continue the [[Indian]] [[trade]] on [[America]]n soil, was rescinded
by the U.S. [[Indian]] Trade and Intercourse Act of [[1816]]. The act, which Astor</p>
<p>guided through [[Congress]], stated that "licenses to [[trade]] with the [[Indian]]s
within the territorial limits of the [[United]] [[States]] shall not be granted to any
but citizens of the [[United]] [[States]], unless by the express direction of the
[[President]]... "20 Even this protectionist measure was not seen as sufficient
to the interests of many [[America]]ns. Since [[1815]], several plans to garrison
the [[Canadian]]-U.S. border had been proposed to [[Congress]]. In [[1818]], Secre</p>
<p>tary of [[War]] John C. Calhoun wanted to establish an army post at the
mouth of the Yellowstone River and sent an expedition to "extend and</p>

<p>protect our [[trade]] with the [[Indian]]s." In his instructions to the expedition</p>
<p>leaders, Calhoun wrote:
... English [[trade]]rs ... have great advantages in controuling the savages thro' their
commanding station on Red river, and as our contemplated establishment at Yellow
Stone, will greatly curtail their [[trade]] towards the head of the Missouri, we must expect</p>
<p>every opposition from them. No pains must be spared to counteract such efforts_21</p>
<p>The Yellowstone Expedition never reached its goal. Logistical prob
lems with steamboats and, most significantly, [[Congress]]'s withdrawal of
support in the wake of the Panic of [[1819]] led to abandonment of the original</p>
<p>purpose. A permanent military presence on the Missouri was established
near Council Bluffs at Missouri Cantonment (later Fort Atkinson), where
over eleven hundred U.S. soldiers were stationed in [[1820]]. But this was little
noticed in Whitehall or at York Factory, where the [[North]]ern Council of
the [[HBC]] convened for its annual directors' meeting to discuss Lord Selkirk's</p>
<p>[[colony]] on Red River and the Company's expansion in Athabasca, the
Columbia District, and [[New]] Caledonia.22</p>
<p>he rhetoric in [[congress]] and among military men set a
tone in foreign policy that contrasted sharply with the diplo
macy of shared occupation evident in the Convention of [[1818]],</p>
<p>which provided that the territory "Westward of the Stony
Mountains, shall, together with its Harbours, [[Bay]]s, and [[Cree]]ks, and the
Navigation of all Rivers within the same, be free and open, for the term of
ten years ... to the Vessels, Citizens, and Subject of the Two Powers."23 Dur</p>
<p>ing the First Semin?le [[War]] in [[1818]], for example, a brash Andrew Jackson
executed two [[British]] subjects in [[Spanish]] Florida and recommended to his</p>
<p>superior, General Henry Atkinson, that all [[British]] [[trade]]rs caught on
[[America]]n soil be hanged.24 From that time to the signing of the Oregon
[[Treaty]] of [[1846]], [[America]]ns exhibited mixed views about the political geog
raphy of Oregon but most agreed on the potential benefits it might bring
to the nation.25 Those same [[America]]ns and many of their elected officials</p>
<p>also had a difficult time making up their minds about the international
legal rights of the London-based [[Bay]] Company. Few understood that Par
liament had granted monopoly charter to the behemoth, with power to
regulate and control the fur [[trade]] of Rupert's Land as well as to build posts</p>
<p>and establish farms and other enterprises, without relinquishing Royal
claim of the lands within the Company's domain. Prior to [[1813]], all Com

<p>Artist Joseph Drayton, who traveled with the Wilkes Expedition, depicted this scene of fur</p>
<p>trappers at Fort Walla Walla in [[1841]]. The fort had been named Fort Nez Perces when the
[[North]] West Company first established it in [[1818]] at the fork of the Walla Walla and</p>
<p>Columbia rivers.</p>
<p>posts through its merger with the [[North]] West Company in [[1821]]. Fort Nez
Perces, built by the [[North]] West Company in [[1818]] and renamed Fort Walla</p>
<p>Walla in [[1825]], was one such prize, as were Spokane House and the Flathead</p>
<p>Post in Montana.26</p>
<p>Much of the confusion stemmed from conflicting signals sent from the</p>
<p>nation's capital. Under the U.S. law of [[1816]], the [[President]] and his desig
nates could grant licenses to foreigners to [[trade]] on [[America]]n soil. By [[1817]],</p>
<p>exceptions were made in the upper [[Great]] Lakes where [[Governor]] Lewis
Cass of Michigan allowed foreigners to enter agreements with all Ameri</p>
<p>can trading [[companies]], notably David Stone and Company, a Detroit
based rival of the AFC's [[North]]ern Department. An ardent champion of
free enterprise, Cass opposed the U.S. factory system established by Con</p>

<p>gress in [[1790]], hoping to keep liquor and unethical [[trade]]rs out of [[Indian]]
country, and was instru[[mental]] in its demise in [[1822]]. Describing the system</p>
<p>as "radically incorrect," Cass gained supporters in the administration and
[[Congress]], looking for any means of trimming the federal budget after the
business downturn of [[1819]].27</p>
<p>In the meantime, the opportunity for most [[America]]ns to hire Cana</p>
<p>dian [[trade]]rs ended under [[President]] Monroe, who in [[November]] [[1818]] re
voked all licenses granted by James Madison. The political friends of Stone</p>
<p>and Astor, however, combined interests and persuaded Monroe to allow
[[America]]ns to hire [[Canadian]] boatmen and interpreters. [[America]]n private
fur-[[trade]] interests also clamored for military and legislative protection of</p>
<p>their capital and human investments in the West. [[Eastern]] financiers re
sented the loss of opportunity on the [[Pacific]] Coast and in the [[North]]west
generally, and Astor faulted the [[government]] for its inaction in exploring,</p>
<p>policing, or garrisoning the Far West.28</p>
<p>Many St. Louis-based merchants and fur [[companies]] knew it was in
their best interest to keep settlers, soldiers, and [[government]] agents out of</p>
<p>[[Indian]] country, but the complications and challenges inherent on the
Missouri and in the Rockies prompted requests for federal intervention.</p>
<p>Most tribes, but especially the Teton Sioux, Arikara, Gros Ventre, and
Blackfeet, were not disposed to allowing [[white]] trappers to displace their
own hunters or to pass freely through their territories and regions where</p>
<p>they had secured status as middleman-[[trade]]rs. They insisted on doing
business with [[white]]s in the same manner that had become customary in
trading with other tribes, with [[trade]] often overlapping sporadic fighting
and counting coup through theft of horses, furs, and other personal ef
fects. Fur-[[trade]] merchants in St. Louis were slow to understand these dy
namics, and [[white]] lives and [[America]]n dollars were lost when their field
personnel circumvented proper [[Indian]] protocols and [[sovereignty]].29
This is a familiar story in the succession of St. Louis-based fur compa</p>
<p>nies from the formation of the Missouri Fur Company in [[1809]] to the
consolidation of several smaller concerns into the Upper Missouri Outfit
of the [[America]]n Fur Company in [[1827]], an oligopoly up to its final dissolu
tion in [[1865]]. Both [[Congress]] and the [[British]] were blamed. High tariffs set</p>
<p>by [[Congress]] on [[British]] and [[French]] imports ? especially firearms and
[[trade]] goods of metal, glass, and woolens ? meant that [[America]]n fur
[[trade]]rs paid dearer prices on imported [[trade]] goods than did their Cana
dian neighbors. From [[1816]] through the [[1830]]s, fur men blamed [[Congress]]
and asked for relief, finding some on specific goods but suffering a general</p>

<p>increase.30 In [[1830]], William Clark, superintendent of [[Indian]] affairs at St.</p>
<p>Louis, wrote:
... the [[America]]n Trader is not only dependent upon his competitor for the very
articles themselves, but has to pay his own Government an average duty of about 60</p>
<p>percent for the priviledge of importing them;... in addition to the advantages al
ready enjoyed by the [[British]] Trader, he is priviledged to land &amp; find a market for his
furs &amp; peltries ... in the [[United]] [[States]], free of duty (which is not reciprocated by G.
[[Britain]]), it will be seen at once, that no Enterprise, talent, or industry can successfully</p>
<p>compete in this Trade, under such disadvantages.31</p>
<p>Some [[America]]ns were also convinced that the [[British]] promoted
[[America]]n losses by encouraging [[Indian]]s to steal or confiscate [[America]]n
procured furs in the field.32 Ultimately, the [[Bay]] Company bore the brunt</p>
<p>of a jealous and expansionary [[America]]n citizenry that wanted its share of
[[British]] good fortunes in the Oregon Country and along the international
border. This was especially characteristic after the [[North]] West Company</p>
<p>merged with the [[HBC]] in [[1821]], a consolidation perceived as a conspiracy</p>
<p>against [[America]]n interests along the border as well as in the joint
occupancy area. In [[1822]], the St. Louis Enquirer [[editorial]]ized:
Since the abolition of the [[United]] [[States]]' factories, a great activity has prevailed in the</p>
<p>operation of this [[trade]]. Those formerly engaged in it have increased their capital and
extended their enterprize, many new firms have engaged in it, and others are prepar</p>
<p>ing to do so. It is computed that a thousand men, chiefly from this place, are now
employed in this [[trade]] on the waters of the Missouri, and half that number on the</p>
<p>Upper Mississippi. The Missouri Fur Company, which alone employs upwards of
300 men, have reached the mountains, and will soon be on the Columbia River.
Others have the same destination, so that the rich furs ofthat region will soon cease
to be the exclusive [[property]] of the Hudson [[Bay]] Company... ,33</p>
<p>Government officials, fur merchants, and [[trade]]rs sided with victims of</p>
<p>[[Indian]] depredations. A survivor of a well-publicized attack on the Mis
souri near the Arikara villages in [[1823]], in which twelve [[white]] trappers died</p>
<p>and an equal number were severely wounded, expressed the exaggerated
view of many [[America]]ns:
The hostility of the Ricarees, Black-feet, Snake, Chiaus [Cheyennes], and Assiniboines,</p>
<p>is entirely owing to the in[[flu]]ence of the [[North]]west or Hudson [[Bay]] Company._
From the English they can get what liquor they want, and the distance is nothing to an
[[Indian]], when he has in view the gratification of his passions. Among the Ricarees I saw</p>
<p>several English medals, and some of [[British]] manufacture_The [[government]] must
remedy these abuses; she must divest herself of that appalling slowness that attends</p>
<p>all her operations_The risque is too great for individual enterprise when unaided
and unassisted by the [[government]].34</p>

<p>The U.S. responded by sending a retaliatory expedition against the
Arikaras, not the purported [[Bay]] Company "instigators" to their north.</p>
<p>After an inconclusive [[battle]] against several hundred [[America]]n soldiers,
sixty armed trappers, and seven hundred Sioux allies, the Arikara agreed
to parlay and then slipped out of their villages during the night to avoid
further retribution.35
[[America]]ns did not conceal their envy or their admiration of the suc</p>
<p>cesses of the [[Bay]] Company on the other side of the Rockies. St. Louis
newspapers alerted the public to the success of William H. Ashley's first
Rocky Mountain Rendezvous of [[1825]], noting that
Ashley has indemnified himself for all the losses occasioned by the murderous attack</p>
<p>of the Arikaras in the summer of the year [[1823]]_In the course of his expedition,
Geni. Ashley fell in with a party in the service of the Hudson [[Bay]] Company, who are</p>
<p>believed to have 1,000 men in their employment west of the Rocky Mountains. The
riches which this [[company]] are carrying out of the territory of the [[United]] [[States]] are</p>
<p>immense, and beyond all calculation_36</p>
<p>Ashley's information came directly from twenty-nine men "who had
recently withdrawn [by desertion] from the Hudson ['s] [[Bay]] Company" as
well as from his business partner, Jedediah Smith, who had visited Flat
head Post along Clark Fork in western Montana in the late fall of [[1824]].
Ashley was especially impressed with the reported eighty thousand beaver
coming out of "that district called the Snake country, which Mr. Smith
understood as being confined to the district claimed by the Shoshone In</p>
<p>dians." Most of the [[HBC]] deserters were [[Eastern]] Iroquois ? "intelligent
men, who were formerly attached to the [[British]] trading [[companies]], and
who have resided many years with the Flat Heads" ? and they became the
subject of a strong [[America]]n defense of the right to engage in free enter</p>
<p>prise in the joint occupancy area. Shoshone, Nez Perce, and Crow also
came to be viewed as friendly in the [[America]]n [[trade]] sphere of the inter
mountain West and were defended in print and before [[Congress]] as inde
pendent of [[British]] in[[flu]]ence. Even Ashley feared [[British]] motives, however,</p>
<p>stating in [[1827]]: "We know... that it is the interest of the [[British]] [[trade]]rs to</p>
<p>poison the minds of the [[Indian]]s in the region of the Rocky Mountains
against us."37
That same year, the Missouri Observer reported Ashley's returns from
the third annual rendezvous as "probably worth 60 or $70,000." The edi</p>
<p>tor of this in[[flu]]ential newspaper repeated the familiar accusation that
[[America]]n citizens were constantly endangered "from the Black Feet and</p>
<p>other [[Indian]]s, who are instigated to rob and murder our people by the</p>

<p>[[British]] [[trade]]rs, who have almost exclusive possession of our territories at</p>
<p>and beyond the Rocky Mountains...." The writer estimated the number</p>
<p>of foreign interlopers on [[America]]n soil to be a thousand men and sur
mised "their annual depredations upon us perhaps about a million of
dollars in money, besides exciting our own [[Indian]]s against us."38</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>N [[1831]], a presidential fact-finding committee deter
mined to set the record straight in an eighty-six-page report that
included assessments of [[America]]n [[trade]] throughout the West. Will
iam Gordon, a former Missouri Fur Company [[trade]]r, claimed that</p>
<p>"five or six hundred men," "fitted out partly from Missouri and partly
from Santa Fe" and "exclusive of the [[British]], who also hunt constantly west
of the mountains and [who] did hunt to the east of them until the Ameri</p>
<p>can hunters became numerous there," were scouring the West trapping
beaver. The [[British]], he claimed, "come to our side of the line, and mean to
exhaust it first: so that the [[treaty]] privilege to hunt and [[trade]] on our side is</p>
<p>of great value to them."39 William H. Ashley provided further testimony:
Hunting is the only way our citizens have to contend with the [[British]] on our ground</p>
<p>in and beyond the mountains, their advantage in trading being so great as to put</p>
<p>competition out of the question. They bring their goods from Hudson's bay, and
from the mouth of the Columbia, without paying any duties, while ours, being
imported through the [[United]] [[States]], are subject to heavy duties, perhaps an average
of 50 or 60 per cent. These goods are of the same kind, being made in England, and the
[[Indian]]s are good judges of their quality and price, so that the difference of 50 or 60 per</p>
<p>cent in their cost puts it out of the power of the [[America]]n [[trade]]r to compete with the</p>
<p>[[British]] [[trade]]rs. The [[British]], besides their permanent posts along the line of our
frontiers, have temporary winter establishments on the [[America]]n side of the line,</p>
<p>where they [[trade]] with our [[Indian]]s, and nearly monopolize the [[trade]] on account of</p>
<p>their advantages.</p>
<p>As for [[America]]ns, Ashley continued,
It is universally considered unsafe to go on the country claimed by the [[British]]; and no</p>
<p>[[America]]n has ever ventured to do it and I have no doubt would loose [sic] his life and
his [[property]] if he did. They [the [[British]]] have spread over the whole region west of the</p>
<p>Rocky mountains, quite to the [[Mexican]] territory, while no [[America]]n has gone north</p>
<p>of 49 degrees, nor even north of the Columbia, nor often to it_the Hudson s [[Bay]]
Company may.... be considered the sole occupants, as they are the only persons
who have any pretensions to a regularly settled system of business, or who have any
establishments in that country.</p>
<p>Ashley concluded with a perspective [[Congress]] seldom heard: "Both the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company and citizens of the [[United]] [[States]] engage in trap</p>

<p>ping, and each suffer occa
sionally from the attacks of the</p>
<p>[[Indian]]s ... [however,] I saw
nothing to justify the opinion
that they excited the [[Indian]]s
to [[kill]] and rob our citizens."40</p>
<p>[[Congress]] continued to
collect testimony on valua
tion of the fur [[trade]] and dep</p>
<p>redations on [[America]]n prop
erty. The Astor firm claimed</p>
<p>that its fur operations in
[[North]] [[America]] were worth
slightly more than one mil
lion dollars a year, and Will</p>
<p>iam Gordon calculated an</p>
<p>annual return of $150,000 on</p>
<p>furs brought into St. Louis</p>
<p>alone. [[Indian]] Agent John
Dougherty tabulated total
valuation for the fur [[trade]] of</p>
<p>Sir George Simpson ([[1876]]-[[1860]]) served as the</p>
<p>the Upper Missouri and [[Hudsons]] [[Bay]] Company's governor-in-chief from [[1821]]
Rocky Mountains from [[1815]]</p>
<p>to i860.</p>
<p>through [[1830]] as $3,750,000, a</p>
<p>profit of $1,650,000 to fur
[[companies]].41 Another inquiry revealed that 234 [[Indian]] depredations had
occurred in the contested area since the [[Treaty]] of Ghent, leaving at least
150 [[America]]ns dead and $149,374 m loss of [[property]], a shocking total that</p>
<p>led Dougherty to recommend building "a small military post, say two
[[companies]]" to protect the fur [[trade]] in the U.S.-[[Canadian]] border region
of the Upper Missouri.42</p>
<p>The forced removal of tribes to [[Indian]] Territory and resistance to
[[America]]n expansion during the Black Hawk [[War]] in [[1832]], however, di
verted presidential and [[congress]]ional action from the Far West. By [[1833]],
large and small fur [[companies]] alike determined to strike bargains with the .</p>
<p>[[Bay]] Company if offered the opportunity. Through its general manager,
Ramsay Crooks, the [[America]]n Fur Company charted the way, accepting a
proposal from [[Governor]] George Simpson to receive ?300 per year in re
turn for a promise not to interfere with [[Indian]]s or the [[Indian]] [[trade]] to the</p>
<p>north or to the west of Lake Superior.43 This little-studied agreement ben</p>

<p>[[British]] Columbia Archives, PDP 05241</p>
<p>In [[1845]] or [[1846]], [[British]] army officer Henry James Wane painted this watercolor of Fort</p>
<p>[[Vancouver]], a trading post on the Columbia River established in [[1825]] to oversee the Columbia</p>
<p>Department of the [[Hudsons]] [[Bay]] Company. Wane, who was twenty-five years old when he
traveled to the West in [[1844]], compiled a rich pictorial record of the [[HBC]]'s western operations.</p>
<p>efited both [[companies]] in that the AFC was able to guarantee fishing rights
on the north side of the [[Great]] Lakes, which was the largest profit sector for</p>
<p>the [[company]] in the late [[1830]]s and [[1840]]s. The agreement was extended
every two to three years, with minor modifications until [[1847]].44</p>
<p>The [[America]]n Fur Company also worked with the [[HBC]] by sharing
market information on furs through the listening post of broker Curtis M.</p>
<p>Lampson in London. Lampson entered the [[trade]] as a Yankee fur pedlar for
Astor, who sent him to London in [[1824]] to buy furs at auction from [[HBC]]
sales. He founded his own [[company]] in [[1830]] and became London agent for
the [[New]] York office of the AFC in [[January]] [[1835]], a relationship that contin</p>
<p>ued through the [[1860]]s.45 Once furs reached [[British]] warehouses, neither
[[HBC]] nor AFC planned to lose the opportunity to sell at the highest price.
Lampson seldom offered furs from both [[companies]] simultaneously in large
lots to furriers based in [[Britain]] or on the Continent. In fact, in the interest</p>
<p>494 OHQ vol. 104, no. 4</p>

<p>of avoiding a glut on the market of any single species of animal, Lampson
often sent catalogues of upcoming sales as well as marked ones of previous</p>
<p>sales to his clients. This level of "friendly competition" meant that com
pany managers in [[North]] [[America]] were instructed to get along with the
opposition as best they could in order to maintain a workable, mutually</p>
<p>beneficial arrangement abroad.46 Once Lampson's information was in
house, both [[companies]] guarded it from the opposition. For example, in
[[February]] [[1838]], William Brewster of the AFC's Detroit office received a
duplicate copy of Lampson's "dear opinion of the prospects for Furs and
skins," with the admonition, "Mr. Lampson's observations you will keep
entirely to yourself." Ramsay Crooks predicted: "If Hudson's [[Bay]] Co. will
only sell stock and leave a clear market, prices must be low, the cheapness
will make skins more generally used, and the market will return to a [[health]]y
state."47</p>
<p>Based on the infrequency of letters to and from London as well as the
repetition of Lampson's reports to the [[North]]ern Department and to part
ners in the St. Louis-based [[Western]] Department, it appears that manag
ers in the interior received their market news directly from [[New]] York and</p>
<p>mainly from Ramsay Crooks, part owner and operations manager of the</p>
<p>Company. The [[Western]] Department often negotiated with rival compa
nies, but no record exists of any formal compact for [[trade]] or agreements
on trading spheres with the [[HBC]]. After [[1833]], friendly posturing and some</p>
<p>assistance in supplying remote opposition posts or [[trade]]rs-in-transit per
meate an otherwise rather sterile documentary record.</p>
<p>^T^he final part of this story takes us back to the Or</p>
<p>1 egon Country, where several diplomatic and economic probes
1 were tested from [[1834]] to [[1846]]. Nearly all explorers, [[trade]]rs, mis</p>
<p>.JIL sionaries, prospective settlers, and U.S. [[government]] agents who
visited the region found it to their liking. Company post managers, espe</p>
<p>cially Dr. John McLoughlin, impressed people as exceptionally helpful
and kind. These same chroniclers raved at the productivity of [[Bay]] Com
pany enterprises ? in furs, [[crops]], fisheries, and livestock. As public offi
cials wrestled with diplomatic matters, private citizens provided contra
dictory views of the [[Bay]] Company's largess.48
Negative voices were few, but they were loud. Hall J. Kelley's was the
most widely heard. His earliest tract in [[1830]] reveals deep admiration for
[[British]] accomplishments in the [[North]]west. A year later, in his General
Circular to all ... who wish to Emigrate to the Oregon Territory, Kelley called</p>
<p>upon [[Congress]] to grant [[America]]n citizens the same rights in Oregon en</p>

<p>joyed by the [[HBC]] under [[parliament]]ary authority, arguing that the [[HBC]]
was a "Colonial Government," not a trading [[company]]. In the two decades
that followed, however, his remarks became vitriolic as he painted a con
spiracy against his [[America]]n Society for the Colonization of Oregon. The
chief purpose of the [[HBC]], he charged, was "to cheat and [[kill]] [[Indian]]s, and
get gain." He claimed that McLoughlin had treated him "with every dem
onstration of inhumanity" and labeled him a "persecuting monster," a "ly</p>
<p>ing spirit... busily engaged in spreading falsehood and calumny among
the settlers and strangers."49</p>
<p>Ironically, a second sour view was offered by one of Kelley's critics. On</p>
<p>the streets of Boston and in print, W.J. Snelling directly challenged the
logic of Kelley's plans, doubting that half the emigrants who wanted to
leave the East for Oregon would make it as far as St. Louis. The way west,</p>
<p>Snelling warned, was full of danger, aridity, and hostility, and the object</p>
<p>? land, timber, fisheries, and good soil ? was obtainable in the state of
Maine with far less trouble. Snelling wryly concluded: "the fur [[trade]] has
been over-done, done to [[death]], for twenty years; especially in Oregon."50</p>
<p>Most eyewitnesses of [[HBC]] operations did not agree. Guests at Mc
Loughlin's table were astonished at their remarkable progress in so short a
time. Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, the Boston ice-cutter who had been in[[flu]]</p>
<p>enced by Kelley's Oregon Colonization Society, struck out to make his
fortune in fish and furs in the joint occupancy area. His description of his
reception at Fort [[Vancouver]] in [[1832]] is typical of other first-hand accounts
of the time:
Here I was received with the utmost kindness and Hospitality by Doct. McLauchland
the acting Gov. of the place_Our people were supplied with food and shelter from</p>
<p>the rain which is constant_I find Doct. McLauchland a fine old gentleman truly
philanthropic in his Ideas he is doing much good by introducing fruits into this
country which will much facilitate the progress of this settlement ([[Indian]] [[corn]] 3000

<p>education deportment and talents-The Co. seem disposed to render me all the
assistance they can they live well at these posts they have 200 acres of land under
cultivation!;] the land is of the finest quality.51</p>
<p>There were some who fared less well. Prior to Wyeth's venture, Gover
nor Simpson had received two independent offers from [[America]]ns active
in the [[North]]west. Jedediah Smith had agreed to give up plans to trap the
Snake River country in [[1828]] in exchange for the Company's purchase of his</p>
<p>horses and furs. He also requested [[HBC]] assistance in retrieving the re
mains and effects of eleven of his men who had been slain following the
disastrous fight with the Umpquas along the Oregon coast in [[July]] of that</p>

<p>year.52 A second proposal in [[1829]]
was tendered by former Missouri</p>
<p>Fur Company partner Joshua
Pilcher, who offered to lead a party</p>
<p>of trappers into Blackfoot coun
try on behalf of the [[Bay]] Company.</p>
<p>Simpson refused the offer, fearing
it would set a precedent of trespass</p>
<p>across international boundaries
that would eventually escalate fric
tion with [[America]]ns.53</p>
<p>Capt. Benjamin Bonneville
made no proposal to the [[Bay]]
Company, but he also became a
casualty of the fur-[[trade]] diplo
matic war. Born in [[France]], Bonne
ville had immigrated with his par</p>
<p>ents to the U.S. and graduated
from West Point. In [[1831]], he took a
leave of absence from the army and
entered the [[trade]] as a private agent,</p>
<p>Nathaniel J. Wyeth, who led expeditions in</p>
<p>writing to his superiors that he in</p>
<p>[[1832]] and [[1834]] in an effort to establish his own</p>
<p>of the [[Indian]] tribes and their hab</p>
<p>[[Vancouver]] Chief Factor John McLoughlin had

quainted with their manner of [[trade]] and intercourse with the [[Indian]]s,
finally, endevour [sic] to develop every advantage the country affords and</p>
<p>by what means they may most readily be opened to the enterprise of our
citizens." Financially backed by Alfred Seton, a [[New]] York merchant and
former Astorian, Bonneville struck out for the Green River with no men.
In [[1832]], he built a fort named for himself near present-day Pinedale, Wyo</p>
<p>ming. For the next three years, he made Fort Bonneville his headquarters

Bonneville arrived at Fort Walla Walla in [[1834]], Chief Trader Pierre Pambrun</p>
<p>suspected espionage and was faced with a serious diplomatic dilemma.
The [[America]]n writer, [[Washington]] Irving, gained access to Bonneville's
private journal and recast the story to a wide reading audience in [[1837]].

<p>This map shows Oregon Territory in [[1838]], during the period when [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the</p>
<p>[[United]] [[States]] jointly occupied the region and [[companies]] from each nation were attempting
to control the fur [[trade]].</p>
<p>The worthy superintendent, who had extended to him all the genial rites of hospital</p>
<p>ity, now suddenly assumed a withered-up aspect and demeanor, and observed that,
however he might feel disposed to serve him, personally, he felt bound by his duty to</p>
<p>the Hudson s [[Bay]] Company, to do nothing which should facilitate or encourage the
visits of other [[trade]]rs among the [[Indian]]s in that part of the country.55</p>
<p>Immediate physical needs were seldom denied weary travelers, but it is
clear that [[Bay]] Company officers carefully weighed the motives of the itin
erant tourists and likely spies who passed through the Columbia. Bonneville</p>
<p>was denied supplies and given an "unkind reception of the [[trade]]rs," who
entreated him to return to the [[States]] as quickly as possible, forcing him to
subsist, he claimed in a letter to Secretary of [[War]] Lewis Cass, "on horses,</p>

<p>dogs, roots &amp; occasionally a salmon." He concluded: "the Hudson [[Bay]] at
present have every advantage over the [[America]]ns."56
The highest praise for the [[Bay]] Company came from those seeking in</p>
<p>formation, protection, supplies, or a good meal. Missionary Jason Lee
reported that post manager Pierre Pambrun at Walla Walla had received
him with "great civility" and that Dr. McLoughlin "has treated us with the</p>
<p>utmost politeness, attention, and liberality." In an [[1838]] letter to her par</p>
<p>ents, Narcissa Whitman described McLoughlin as "our excellent friend</p>
<p>and kind benefactor" and elsewhere described Fort [[Vancouver]] as the "[[New]]
York of the [[Pacific]] Ocean."57
Early Oregon settlers and even military [[representative]]s of the [[United]]
[[States]] reinforced these sentiments. John Ball, a graduate of Dartmouth
College and one of the earliest [[America]]n farmers in Oregon, sent a series of</p>
<p>letters home during his trek with Nathaniel Wyeth's party in [[1832]]. The
letters were published in the [[New]] York Commercial Advertiser. While on
the Columbia, he wrote: "Mr. M'Laughlin encouraged a few men (some of
whom came out here with Mr. Astor's concern) to settle on the Multnomah,
where ... I intend to settle. He has liberally engaged to lend me a plough,
an axe, oxen, cow, &amp;c."58
As the political [[climate]] to take over Oregon intensified in [[Washington]],</p>
<p>all seemed peaceful on the Columbia. Both Lt. Charles Wilkes in [[1841]] and</p>
<p>Capt. John Charles Fremont in [[1843]] met McLoughlin, who cooperated
with their respective surveys of the region. McLoughlin provided Wilkes
with a large bateau, nine of his boatmen, and camp equipment from Fort
[[Vancouver]]'s stores to facilitate the [[America]]n scientific expedition. Fremont</p>
<p>later wrote: "Dr. McLaughlin [sic] ... received me with the courtesy and
hospitality for which he has been eminently distinguished, and which makes</p>
<p>a forcible and delightful impression on a traveler from the long wilderness</p>
<p>from which we had issued." McLoughlin also helped [[America]]n settlers,
Fremont reported: "I found many [[America]]n emigrants at the fort; others
had already crossed the river into their land of promise ? the Walahmette
[Willamette] valley. Others were daily arriving; and all of them had been
furnished with shelter... ."59</p>
<p>Capitalists with an eye on land, furs, or commercial opportunities
seldom shared the world views of preachers, soldiers, and ploughmen, but</p>
<p>they also exercised caution in not wearing out their welcome in the [[HBC]]
dominated [[North]]west. Wyeth in particular planned to take full advantage
of the spirit of joint occupation by moving directly into [[HBC]]-controlled</p>
<p>parts of the Oregon Country. His early favorable remarks about the
Company illustrate his diplomatic acumen in gaining a foothold within

<p>Dr. John McLoughlin, chief factor at Fort [[Vancouver]] from [[1824]] to [[1846]], was charged with the</p>
<p>oversight of the Columbia District of the [[Hudsons]] [[Bay]] Company. He posed here with George</p>
<p>[[War]]ren Hyde and Dan O'Neil and his granddaughters Margaret Rae Wygant and Louisa
Rae Myrick.</p>
<p>the Columbia District. As H.M. Chittenden put it, "Wyeth's indomitable
pluck won for him the admiration of every one and particularly of the</p>
<p>philanthropic Hudson [[Bay]] Company factor at Fort [[Vancouver]], the
venerable Dr. John McLoughlin. These two men formed an earnest and
lasting attachment for each other with which the necessities of business
competition were never permitted to interfere."60
Behind a thin mask of diplomacy, Wyeth's aggressive plans to become a</p>
<p>power broker soon surfaced.61 In [[1832]], he concocted two grandiose inter
dependent schemes. He proposed to supply [[America]]ns at the annual Rocky</p>
<p>Mountain Rendezvous with goods brought overland from Boston and
[[New]] York in exchange for cash and furs ? hardly a novel scheme, but no</p>

<p>one had attempted such from both coasts. He would also harvest salmon
from the Columbia for trans-shipment in barrels by sea to the East Coast,
where a ready market existed for salted or pickled fish, an industry that the</p>
<p>[[Bay]] Company was developing and that had only a short [[history]] on the
Columbia dating back to [[1829]].62 In [[February]] [[1832]], true [[America]]n compe
tition arrived when two Yankee ships, the Owhyhee and the Convoy, crossed</p>
<p>the Columbia bar and spent the spring trading with local [[Indian]]s for</p>
<p>salmon and furs. This forced the [[HBC]] to reduce its [[trade]] tariff consider
ably in order to keep local [[Indian]]s from totally abandoning Fort Vancou</p>
<p>ver's [[trade]] shop. The ships departed on [[July]] 29, "after giving us an immen
sity of trouble," McLoughlin recalled. Over a year later, fifty-three barrels</p>
<p>of Columbia River salmon were unloaded at Boston.63</p>
<p>Nathaniel Wyeth was connected with some of the same Boston mer</p>
<p>chants who were behind this and other [[Pacific]] Coast speculations. His
own plan became more elaborate in [[1833]]. In a remarkable letter to Gover
nor George Simpson, Wyeth proposed a five-year agreement in which the
[[HBC]] would supply goods to Wyeth, who in turn would trap the area south
of the Columbia and deliver all furs to the Company. Wyeth stated his case</p>
<p>plainly using economic savings and high profits as the guiding reason why
the [[HBC]] ought to accept his offer. He asked to form his own brigade of
around fifteen trappers through an [[HBC]] agent, exclaiming: "[[Canadian]]s
are to be had cheaper than [[America]]ns and are for some purposes better
men." He also planned to build a post "on the Columbia or south of it for
collecting furs and salmon to be sent to the [[States]] by vessells [sic] ordered
therefrom such vessells to bring out the goods required for the [[trade]]." The</p>
<p>issue of joint occupancy is imbedded in his reminder to Simpson: "It ap</p>
<p>pears to me that as an [[America]]n I posses [sic] some advantage than an
Englishman would not inasmuch as I can visit parts of the country from
which he is excluded and still not so remote in point of distance difficulty
or expense as from St. Louis."64 Wyeth's proposal did not require an imme</p>
<p>diate decision by Simpson, who had departed for England, where he spent
the winter.
By summer, Wyeth was rescuing another of his ventures, this one at the</p>
<p>annual mountain man rendezvous. From Green River, Wyeth wrote [[HBC]]
[[trade]]r Francis Ermatinger, who had not attended the gathering that year:
... you would have been Robbed of your goods and Beaver if you had come here_I
give you this as an honest opinion which you can communicate to the Co. There is
here a great majority of Scoundrels. I should much doubt the personal safety of any
one from your side of the house.65</p>

<p>Wyeth returned to Boston where he wrote Simpson on [[November]] 20,
regretting that he had troubled him with the original proposal: "all fur
ther negotiations for the present are at an end in regard to this subject."
But the next year he was back in the West, determined to execute his plan
with or without the [[HBC]]. At great expense, he carted thirteen thousand
pounds of merchandise to the rendezvous, only to find he was too late to</p>
<p>swap his consignee ? the Rocky Mountain Fur Company ? for its furs.
Angered and frustrated, Wyeth is said to have told Milton Sublette and his</p>
<p>partners, "Gentlemen, I will roll a stone into your garden that you will
never be able to get out."66</p>
<p>Before hearing from Simpson, whose terse rejection of Wyeth's pro
posal did not reach the Columbia until [[October]], Wyeth took advantage of</p>
<p>distance from London and [[Washington]]. He approached McLoughlin di
rectly and asked him to intervene. In a very unusual document drafted to
formalize their agreement, McLoughlin accepted Wyeth's salmon fishing,</p>
<p>horse trading, and merchandising to [[America]]n trappers. Wyeth prom
ised not to encroach on the [[trade]] out of Fort [[Vancouver]] or above the</p>
<p>Grand Ronde River, and McLoughlin agreed that the [[HBC]] would not
[[trade]] beyond the Grand Ronde, except for Snake Country brigades under</p>
<p>Francis Ermatinger and Thomas McKay. Those brigades would continue
to have the right to enter the country to the south and west to [[trade]] with</p>
<p>[[America]]n trappers as well as the right to participate independently at the</p>
<p>[[America]]n summer rendezvous. McLoughlin also authorized [[trade]]r Pierre
Pambrun to supply Wyeth with goods for his post, should he fall short
from his own sources.67</p>
<p>Historians have mulled over the exceptional good [[treatment]] given
Nat Wyeth and the implications of this agreement. Herman J. Deutsch
speculated that had [[America]]n fur [[trade]]rs been stronger, the division of
fur-[[trade]] bailiwicks on either side of the Grande Ronde may have become
the international boundary. John S. Galbraith has reasoned that, in theory,</p>
<p>the [[HBC]] considered concessions to the opposition "repugnant to the poli
cies of the Company, which sanctioned permanent division of territory
only with a large [[company]] capable of enforcing its part of such arrange
ment." On the practical side, however, "the Company surrendered little of</p>
<p>value, for the Grand Ronde country was not rich in furs and the right
granted Ermatinger and McKay to [[trade]] at the rendezvous preserved the
Company's only valuable connection with that country." As Dorothy Nafus
Morrison has recently written in her biography of McLoughlin, "the idea</p>
<p>appealed to McLoughlin as reasonable and sound. In [[1829]] [[Governor]]
Simpson had told him that if rivals appeared, the [[company]] should cmeet</p>

<p>them fairly and openly as competitors in Trade,' and 'studiously avoid any
discreditable proceeding which might tarnish the reputation of the Honble</p>
<p>Coy.' " McLoughlin "was convinced that the Bostonian's venture would
soon collapse, and he feared that if he refused supplies, the resourceful</p>
<p>[[New]] Englander might bring in goods from some other source. So he de
cided to deal with Wyeth as a new outlet and accepted the proposal, but
retained trapping rights in the valuable Flathead Country." McLoughlin
would later write to a disgruntled Simpson: "Mr. Wyeth ... told me that
he did not come to oppose us, if we would put no obstacles in the way of his</p>
<p>trading Horses in the Interior or Salmon there, as his object was to salt
Salmon for exportation, and to deal with the [[America]]n Trappers in the
Snake Country."68</p>
<p>W</p>
<p>YETH NEVER RECEIVED FORMAL approval from
Simpson. Instead, he skirted official permission from the</p>
<p>[[Governor]] and Committee and established a small trad</p>
<p>ing station ? Fort William ? at [[War]]rior Point on the
northern end of Sauvie Island at the con[[flu]]ence of the Columbia and</p>
<p>Willamette rivers. A second, more ambitious post was built on "Lewis
River" ? the Snake ? well to the south of any others in the [[HBC]]'s trading
sphere.69 Within sight of the Union Jack and under the watchful but coop</p>
<p>erative eyes of Thomas McKay, the leader of the Company's Snake River
Brigade of [[1834]]-[[1835]], Wyeth built Fort Hall, his proverbial "stone in the
garden," near the junction of the Portneuf and Snake rivers in present-day</p>
<p>Idaho. The palisades and two bastions were completed on [[August]] 6, "on
which day the Am. Standard was raised in regions remote from its usual
habitation and amid the noise of revelry and gun powder it floated in the
gaze of the astonished Savages." A week later, Wyeth departed to the mouth</p>
<p>of the Columbia to meet his ship, the [[May]] Dacre, leaving manager Robert
Evans and eleven men at the new fort.70</p>
<p>The "Savages" Wyeth described were part of Thomas McKay's [[HBC]]
brigade; and in McKay, Wyeth met his match at entrepreneurship. De
scribed by George Simpson as "a half breed of the Saulteaux Tribe ... one
of the best Shots in the Country and very cool and resolute among Indi
ans, [McKay] has always been employed on the most desperate service in
the Columbia and the more desperate it is the better he likes it." John Kirk</p>
<p>Townsend, an ornithologist who accompanied Wyeth, described the scene:
"We found Mr. McKay's [[company]] encamped on the bank of the river within</p>
<p>a few hundred yards of our tents. It consists of thirty men, thirteen of</p>
<p>whom are [[Indian]]s, Nez Perces, Chinooks and Kayouse [Cayuse], with a</p>

<p>few squaws. The remainder are [[French]]-[[Canadian]]s and half-breeds."71 In
Wyeth's absence, McKay would soon enter into his own private deals with</p>
<p>Wyeth's partners.
Within months it was apparent that the plan of a salmon and fur enter
prise, each dependent on the other and both linked to perfect timing by
land and by water, was flawed. Capt. Joseph Thing and Wyeth had similar</p>
<p>visions but very different management styles, and a dozen Hawaiian la
borers under Thing's supervision deserted by the winter of [[1835]]. The prob</p>
<p>lems piled up. The [[May]] Dacre arrived on the Columbia three months late
owing to damage from lightning at sea. By then, the salmon run had passed,</p>
<p>and Wyeth's empty barrels were useless, at least for a year, so he loaded the</p>
<p>ship with lumber to [[trade]] in Hawaii. He wrote his brother: "If at the close
of next year our prospects are not brighter you may expect to see me back</p>
<p>again, following with fresh spirits some new or old plans of profit or im</p>
<p>provement."72
At Fort Hall, according to one employee, Evans "partook too freely of
the spirituous Liquors and kept a very loose account of the [[property]] en</p>
<p>trusted to him." Such behavior prompted Wyeth to replace Evans with
Thing. To keep the men busy and on speculation of making more in furs
than fish, Thing entered into partnership with Thomas McKay to form a
"Flat head country expedition" designed to build a new post in the Salmon</p>
<p>River country. This and subsequent trapping parties were attacked by
Blackfeet, forcing contraction rather than expansion of fur-gathering ac
tivities. McKay was instructed to spend the winter along the River Boise,
where he built a fort in the fall of [[1834]] a considerable distance downstream
from Fort Hall. Both [[America]]n visitors and [[HBC]] officials saw the fort ?
first known as Snake Fort ? as McKay's private venture, not official Com
pany [[property]], even though McKay held the rank of clerk within the orga</p>
<p>nization. In [[1837]], the post was renamed Fort Boise, for the Big Wood
River, and was subsumed into the [[Bay]] Company's official list of Columbia
District properties, with McKay in charge.73 By then, Wyeth was out of</p>
<p>resources, and he retreated to Boston in [[1837]]. Fort Hall and all of the
[[property]] within its walls were sold to the [[HBC]].
Both forts improved their fortunes after [[1838]], at which time Fort Hall</p>
<p>was added to the Snake Country Department. Despite decline in fur re
turns across the interior Mountain West, fur-return profits from the Snake</p>
<p>Country rose from ?250 in [[1838]] to ?1,673 in [[1839]] and ?2,400 in [[1842]]. [[British]]</p>
<p>good fortune in the Columbia Department improved as [[America]]ns
struggled to keep the rendezvous system alive. Cornelius Rogers, a lay</p>

<p>This hand-colored lithograph of Fort [[Vancouver]] in [[1845]] was based on a sketch by Henry</p>
<p>James Wane, a young [[British]] army lieutenant who visited several forts and settlements in
the Oregon Country during his seven-month journey in [[1845]]-[[1846]].</p>
<p>missionary bound for Henry Spalding's Lapwai Mission, wrote from the
Wind River Mountains in [[July]] [[1838]], describing the rendezvous: "The Ameri</p>
<p>can Fur Company must soon abandon the mountains. The [[trade]] is un
profitable, and the men are becoming dissatisfied; besides, the Hudson
[[Bay]] Company will break down all opposition. Their resources are bound
less, and they stop at no expense."74</p>
<p>Most historians have interpreted the completion of these two small
posts as [[America]]n and [[British]] first and second punches in the economic
and diplomatic war that escalated into the [[1840]]s.75 In [[1847]], after the [[Treaty]]</p>
<p>of [[Washington]] had settled the boundary dispute, Wyeth revised the expla
nation of his misfortunes, reconciling himself a victim of "the commercial
distress of that time." In [[1839]], however, he had blamed [[HBC]]'s refusal to</p>
<p>honor the joint occupation agreement of [[1818]], which provided [[Congress]]
and the [[America]]n reading public fuel to feed the fires of expansionism in
the [[North]]west.76</p>

<p>Beginning with [[Washington]] Irving in [[1839]] and culminating with H.H.
Bancroft's in[[flu]]ential [[1886]] History of Oregon, Wyeth's story was transformed</p>
<p>from one of special privilege to one that depicted him as a victim of inter</p>
<p>national struggle. Bancroft wrote:
... Wyeth's purpose was not settlement, but traffic_As this did not suit the gentle</p>
<p>men of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, who were strong in land and desired the con
tinuance of their monopoly, but who were without the political right to drive out the</p>
<p>people of the [[United]] [[States]] while entertaining them hospitably, as a rule, at Fort
[[Vancouver]], they so circumscribed and defeated their business efforts in this quarter
that Wyeth among others was finally forced to sell to them and retire from the field.77</p>
<p>Bradford Cole questions this interpretation: "Although Fort Boise evolved
into the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's competitor to Fort Hall," he concludes,
"McKay's original intent is not totally clear." Cole also finds compelling
evidence in the "Henry Hall Letter Book" that Wyeth was more the victim</p>
<p>of bad timing, overly ambitious schemes, and personnel problems than
[[HBC]] opposition, at least at the district and local levels.78
Wyeth expressed some gratification that his efforts in [[1834]] had a lasting</p>
<p>legacy in that "19 of those who then accompanied me including the mis</p>
<p>sionaries remained permanently in the country," part of the [[America]]n
phalanx that would call for the U.S. takeover of Oregon by the late [[1830]]s.</p>
<p>Overall, his long-term plan failed to bridge [[America]]n free enterprise in
the central Rockies with [[HBC]] activities in the [[North]]west through fish and</p>
<p>furs, but his enterprises opened the door for a greater threat to both the</p>
<p>Hudson's [[Bay]] Company and [[America]]n fur-[[trade]] entrepreneurs. Ameri
can farmers and zealous missionaries were willing to accept [[HBC]] largess</p>
<p>but were ideologically committed to a change of flags and religious de
nominations.79
Even before Wyeth had submitted his [[1839]] memorial to [[Congress]], thirty</p>
<p>six residents had signed their own petition calling for the [[United]] [[States]] to</p>
<p>take "formal and speedy possession" of Oregon. The "Oregon Memorial"</p>
<p>built on a [[1837]] report to [[Congress]] by naval officer William A. Slacum.</p>
<p>Slacum had sailed the brig Loriot into the Columbia on [[December]] 22,
[[1836]], to investigate brashly with scrupulous detail the activities of the Brit
ish and the resident [[America]]ns. Since "the coalition, in [[1821]]," he declared,</p>
<p>"the now Hudson [[Bay]] Company have extended their enterprises over an
extent of country almost incalculable." In a jingoistic tone consistent with
the administration that had sent him on his mission, Slacum made a case
for liberating [[America]]ns and the retired "[[Canadian]] settlers" who had for</p>
<p>merly served the Company and who were now on the Willamette, "al</p>

<p>though freemen in every sense of the word still subject to the protection and</p>
<p>authority, otherwise thraldom of the Hudson [[Bay]] Company." He concluded:</p>
<p>"this monopoly is very wealthy; and when the question of our western
lines of territory is settled, they (the Hudson [[Bay]] Company) will make the</p>
<p>most strenuous efforts to retain free navigation of the Columbia ? more
important to them than the free navigation of the St. Lawrence is to the
people of the [[United]] [[States]]."80</p>
<p>With Slacum's document in hand and spurred on by Jason Lee, the
most ardent champion of [[America]]n takeover, PL. Edwards drafted the
document. Ten of the signers were attached to the Protestant mission en
terprises in Oregon, seventeen were [[America]]n citizens who resided near</p>
<p>mission stations, and nine were [[French]] [[Canadian]]s in residence or in re
tirement at Champoeg or [[French]] Prairie. Far less critical than Slacum, the</p>
<p>"Memorial" extolled the "commercial advantages of the territory" and its</p>
<p>"happy position for [[trade]] with [[China]], India, and the western coasts of
[[America]]." Edwards predicted a lively exchange with Hawaii and other
exotic ports for beef and flour from Oregon farms. The document in
cluded no outright accusations of mis[[treatment]] but focused on "the feel</p>
<p>ing of dependence on the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, and to their moral</p>
<p>in[[flu]]ence."81</p>
<p>The "Memorial" was a good nudge, but [[Congress]] and the State Depart
ment were not ready to move. Edwards would write his own reason why
[[America]]ns should take to the Oregon Trail in the next few years. His Emi
grants' Guide in [[1842]] gave its readers a glowing report of the prospects of
growing fruit, "even grapes," grains that "have never failed, or been af
fected by blight, weevil or mildew," and soils where "there is but little dif</p>
<p>ference in the produce of grain sown in the spring and that sown in the</p>
<p>fall." In short, "in no country in the world may the husbandman look
forward with more assurance to the reward of his toil."82</p>
<p>Other voices new to Oregon in [[1842]]-[[1845]] shared
I Edwards's enthusiasm. In [[1843]],as [[America]]n settlers poured</p>
<p>r into the Oregon Country, the [[HBC]] moved its Columbia De</p>
<p>partment headquarters from [[Vancouver]] to Victoria, antici
pating the "monstrous [[treaty]]" that would end the Company's hegemony
of the region. During the transition, the older posts continued to serve as</p>
<p>general stores to [[America]]ns and [[Canadian]]s alike, supplying a larger vol
ume of axes, plows, and hammers than traps, blankets, or [[trade]] goods to
the new clientele. Rufus Sage, a mountain man who visited the region in
[[1842]], reported: "The agents of the Hudson [[Bay]] Company at present are of</p>

<p>great advantage to emigrants. They extend to them every reasonable assis</p>
<p>tance by selling goods and necessaries at very low prices, and receiving
their various products in payment upon most favorable terms."83
On the eve of the final negotiations leading to the [[Treaty]] of Washing
ton, John Dunn, a former [[Bay]] Company employee who spent eight years</p>
<p>on the Columbia, saw the irony in the new power relationship. In The
Oregon Territory and the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n Fur Trade, published in
London in [[1844]] and reissued in Philadelphia in [[1845]], Dunn wrote:
The object of the [[America]]ns is to have the dominion of the whole continent, from the</p>
<p>[[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]]; and to exclude all [[Europe]]ans, especially [[British]] subjects, from</p>
<p>all habitation there. This they do not disguise: indeed, they are every day growing
bolder, and more exclusive in their tone.84</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dunn proclaimed, "The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company... exercises
almost absolute sway over the whole of the northwest of [[America]], and it</p>
<p>may be averred, also over the Oregon country. Their power is the only
civilized power known to the [[Indian]]s which they show any disposition to
yield to, or even respect." In [[1845]], the [[British]] [[government]] sent lieutentants</p>
<p>Henry [[War]]re and and Mervin Vavasour, Royal Engineers, to determine
the status of readiness should the Oregon question not be resolved peace

<p>ful farm... in a "very comfortable log Cabin, Barns, &amp;c. and with his
[[Indian]] Wife appears quite satisfied with his lot and apparently intent upon</p>
<p>making his way among the Yankees, by whom he is surrounded."85 [[War]]re
blasted McLoughlin for what he saw in Oregon:
We are convinced that without their [[[HBC]]] assistance not 30 families would now
have been in the settlement the first Immigration in [[1841]] or [[1842]] arrived in so miser</p>
<p>able a Condition that had it not been for the trading posts of the Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company they must have starved or been cut off by the [[Indian]]s ... their numbers</p>
<p>have Increased so Rapidly that the [[British]] party are now in the Minority.... Their
Lands are Invaded themselves insulted and they now Require the protection of the
[[British]] Government against the Very people to the Introduction of whom they have</p>
<p>been more than Accessory."86</p>
<p>Infuriated by [[War]]re's report, McLoughlin wrote a lengthy reply, refuting</p>
<p>the accusations, denying most outright, and adding: "... as a Good and
faithful Subject it was my Duty to do my Utmost to maintain peace and
order Between the [[British]] Subjects and [[America]]n Citizens...." Later that</p>
<p>year, McLoughlin was informed that the Company planned to transfer
him to a post east of the Rockies at a reduced salary. Enough was enough.
He resigned, retiring to his home in Oregon City, but not before writing</p>

<p>the governor of the [[HBC]]: "I have Drunk and am Drinking the cup of Bit
terness to the very Dregs."87</p>
<p>During the years of Provisional Government, from [[1843]] to [[1849]], and
prior to the arrival of [[Governor]] Joseph Lane, Oregon was unique in the
coalition that combined to organize a successful [[government]].88 Described</p>
<p>by John McLoughlin as "merely a union of certain parties, [[British]] and
[[America]]n subjects, being divested of all nationality of character, having</p>
<p>no national objects in view, and its exclusive aim and purpose being the
protection of persons and [[property]]," historians still discuss the motives
and levels of support that led to division at the forty-ninth parallel.89 Most</p>
<p>recently, it has become clear that despite saber rattles from the Polk ad</p>
<p>ministration and Lord Aberdeen's polite but forceful rejections of the
[[America]]n demand of lands south of "54'4o?," England was disinterested in</p>
<p>another boxing match with [[America]]ns on the Columbia. Both nations
were satisfied with the [[treaty]].90 As historian Herman Deutsch concludes,
the real winner was the settler; the immediate loser was the fur [[trade]]r,
[[America]]n as well as [[British]]; and the ultimate victims were [[Native]] peoples,
whose lands and resources would soon be severely compromised. The [[treaty]]
said nothing about [[Indian]] rights but guaranteed navigation and trading
rights to the [[HBC]] "and to all [[British]] subjects trading with the same" on the</p>
<p>Columbia. Possessory rights of the [[HBC]] "and of all [[British]] subjects who
may be already in the occupation of land or other [[property]] lawfully ac
quired" was affirmed, as were farms, land, and other [[property]] belonging
to the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company, a subsidiary of the [[HBC]] and
the largest farming enterprise in the region. Finally, the [[United]] [[States]] re</p>
<p>served the right to take possession of any [[British]] holdings "of public and
political importance ... at a proper valuation, to be agreed upon between
the parties."91</p>
<p>In [[1847]], [[Governor]] Simpson estimated the [[HBC]]'s holdings within the
[[America]]n sector (exclusive of rights to navigate on the Columbia River)
worth ?466,400, or $2,230,oo.92 Three years earlier, one [[French]] [[Canadian]]</p>
<p>missionary estimated the "[[Canadian]] population, countrywomen and chil
dren, is about 1,000 souls, distributed about as follows: 600 at Willamette,
100 at [[Vancouver]], 100 at Cowlitz; the rest are scattered at the various posts
of the Company." At the time of ratification of the [[Treaty]] of [[Washington]],</p>
<p>four hundred [[Bay]] Company employees were listed on the [[company]] pay
roll in the "Oregon Country." By nationality or ethnicity, they were enu</p>
<p>merated as 70 [[French]] [[Canadian]]s, 11 Iroquois [[Indian]]s, 42 "half breeds or
men with some [[Indian]] blood," 152 "Sandwich Islanders," 40 Englishmen, 10
[[Canadian]]s "of [[British]] origin," 17 mainland Scots, 26 Orkadians, 21 Hebre</p>

<p>dians, 10 others from various islands of [[Scotland]], and one [[French]]man.93
Some would continue to work for the [[Bay]] Company, which exercised its
right to [[trade]] and commerce at Fort [[Vancouver]] until i860, after which the</p>
<p>post was closed and the structures deteriorated rapidly. A few would leave</p>
<p>for [[Vancouver]] Island and other [[Bay]] Company posts or return to their
place of origin. Still others would stay and live out their lives with the new</p>
<p>[[America]]n settlers at Oregon City, Champoeg, and [[French]] Prairie.94
[[America]]ns had entered the period of joint occupancy with a glimmer</p>
<p>of knowledge of the [[Bay]] Company's presence to the north and west of
[[America]]n interests. By the [[1830]]s, a few entrepreneurs had focused on the</p>
<p>natural resources of the region under [[HBC]] domination. They were fol
lowed by missionary organizations that combined interests with coloni
zation societies determined to gain [[America]]n access to the region. Public
perceptions of the [[Bay]] Company remained mixed from the merger with
the [[North]] West Company in [[1821]] through the early years of provisional
[[government]] in the [[1840]]s. Despite the best efforts of John McLoughlin and</p>
<p>his officers to accommodate all interest groups, by [[1846]] the hegemony of
the Leviathan of the [[North]] had been broken. Thereafter, the Company's
presence would continue in the region as late as [[1871]], but for most Ameri
cans it had returned "back home" to its [[British]] origins.95</p>
