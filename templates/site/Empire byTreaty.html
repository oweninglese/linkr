<p>Empire by [[Treaty]]?
The role of written documents in [[Europe]]an overseas
expansion, [[1500]]-[[1800]]
Martine van Ittersum
Abstract
[[Treaty]]-making was integral to [[Europe]]an imperialism and [[colonialism]]
in the early modern period. [[Europe]]ans did not seek to enter into equal
[[treaties]] with [[indigenous]] rulers or peoples, but to conclude agreements that
advanced their own claims to [[trade]] and/or territory. Two case studies – the
Banda Islands and the Hudson Valley in the seventeenth century – serve
to illustrate this point. Of course, the extent to which [[Europe]]ans achieved
their aims depended on local power constellations in [[Africa]], Asia or the
[[America]]s, and the diplomatic fallout back in [[Europe]]. Still, in a world of
endemic [[violence]], [[treaty]] and [[alliance]] making were essential p[[reparations]]
for the next round of [[warfare]] and, thus, [[empire]]-building.

<p>In [[August]] [[1999]], nine members of Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) entered
the grounds of the [[Dutch]] embassy in Jakarta, demanding that the [[King]]dom
of the Netherlands support Aceh’s independence at the UN and retract its
[[1873]] declaration of war against the Sultanate of Aceh. As the GAM members
were well aware, the Sultanate had been incorporated into the [[Dutch]] East
Indies in [[1904]], after a decades-long guerrilla war in the [[jungle]] of Sumatra.
A retraction of the [[1873]] declaration of war would, GAM members imagined,
be the first step in restoring Acehnese [[sovereignty]] and independence. Yet
it was not so easy to turn back the clock. In [[1948]], the [[Dutch]] [[government]]
had recognised the Republic of [[Indonesia]] as the sole successor state to
the [[Dutch]] East Indies. Since then, it has carefully refrained from offering</p>

<p>any kind of support for independence movements active in Sumatra, the
Spice Islands and Timor. In the end, [[Indonesia]]n police removed the GAM
[[protest]]ers from the embassy compound after three days, but, at the [[Dutch]]
[[government]]’s request, did not place them under arrest.1
What makes these [[[[protest]]s]] especially interesting is that GAM justified its
actions with reference to modern international law, particularly the role played
by written documents in orchestrating transfers of [[sovereignty]]. This was not
an isolated episode, rather it forms part of a broader interest by [[indigenous]]
groups and their supporters in mobilising the language of earlier [[treaties]] and
agreements. One place this can be seen is in the writings of James Tully, who
served on the [[Canadian]] Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples from [[1991]]
until [[1995]]. Tully assigns an important role to [[treaty]]-making in the process of
reconciliation between the [[aboriginal]] and non-[[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]].
He suggests a return to an idealised past of early modern [[treaty]]-making, a
period of time when [[Europe]]ans and [[indigenous]] groups were evenly matched
and treated each other as equals. While recognising the presence of abuses, he
places considerable value on what he considers to be the original intentions
behind [[treaties]] from the early modern period, namely to settle differences
between natives and [[Europe]]ans ‘by means of discussion and consent, without
interfering in the internal [[government]] of either society’.2
A similar desire to look again at early modern [[treaties]] animates a number
of recent publications by historians who have increasingly entered the
debate about [[treaty]]-making past and present. Two important contributions
are [[Native]] Claims: [[Indigenous]] Law against Empire, [[1500]]-[[1920]] ([[2012]]) and
Empire by [[Treaty]]: Negotiating [[Europe]]an Expansion, [[1600]]-[[1900]] ([[2015]]), both
edited by Saliha Belmessous. These volumes raise the important question
whether [[treaties]] between [[Europe]]ans and [[indigenous]] populations around the
world can be read as alternatives to conquest and war and, possibly, as the
means by which [[indigenous]] peoples have sought to turn the tide of [[Western]]
imperialism and [[colonialism]]. Belmessous notes in her introduction to Empire

[[government]] [[representative]]s started to visit the area on a regular basis – primarily to check on
rebuilding activities, to which the Netherlands contributed $100 million. The [[Dutch]] [[government]]
was not involved in the [[2005]] peace negotiations between GAM and the [[Indonesia]]n [[government]],
not officially at least.

<p>by [[Treaty]] that [[treaty]]-making plays an important role in ‘the resolution of
conflicts over [[indigenous]] rights in postcolonial settler societies’. Similarly,
Paul Patton, one of the contributors, argues that the [[treaty]] relationship
reflects a desire ‘on all sides’ to legitimise settler [[sovereignty]] ‘by reference to
the consent, however belated or hypothetical, of […] [[indigenous]] peoples’.3
But is this more positive view justified? Not all the contributors to Empire
by [[Treaty]] are as sanguine as Belmessous and Patton appear to be about the
capacity of [[indigenous]] groups to negotiate or resist [[empire]] via [[treaties]]. In
her chapter on territorial conflict and [[alliance]]-making in pre-[[1800]] [[South]]
[[America]], Tamar Herzog convincingly shows that [[treaties]] were ‘instruments
of containment’ aimed at realising ‘to the degree that this was possible – the
subjection of all things [[indigenous]]’.4 Similarly, in a review of Empire by [[Treaty]],
Dane [[Kennedy]] suggests that the [[history]] of [[treaty]]-making raises serious
concerns about the legitimacy of settler [[sovereignty]], since ‘[[indigenous]]
consent was often coerced’.5
This chapter argues that [[treaty]]-making should not be seen as an alternative to conquest and war, but was, in fact, integral to the process of [[Europe]]an
possession and [[indigenous]] dispossession. [[Europe]]ans who ventured overseas
in the early modern era did not aim to enter into equal [[treaties]] with [[indigenous]] rulers or peoples, but to conclude agreements that advanced their own
claims to [[trade]] and/or territory. In a world of endemic conflict, [[treaty]]- and
[[alliance]]-making were essential p[[reparations]] for the next armed conflict.
If [[treaties]] were an instrument of [[Europe]]an expansion, their deployment
depended on the nature of the states that opposed them. When [[Europe]]ans
encountered regional powers like Ming or Qing [[China]] and Tokugawa Japan,
their advantages disappeared.6 Significantly, the polities capable of withstanding the onslaught of [[Europe]]an [[company]]-states such as the English
and [[Dutch]] East India Companies were those that possessed sizable armed
forces and bureaucracies of their own or that could successfully play off
[[Europe]]an competitors against each other.
But in places where [[Europe]]ans did not face entrenched powers, the [[treaty]]
became a document that was closely linked to expansion. To illustrate
this, I examine two cases studies from opposite ends of the world, [[Dutch]]
[[trade]] and settlement in the Banda Islands in Asia and in the Hudson Valley

<p>in the [[America]]s.7 Neither area was under the direct rule of the federal
[[government]] of the [[Dutch]] Republic. Instead, the [[Dutch]] [[States]] General had
established two corporate bodies with sweeping powers: the [[Dutch]] East and
West India Companies (VOC and WIC), founded in [[1602]] and [[1621]], respectively.
Both [[companies]] operated simultaneously as associations of private merchants
and, in their charter areas, as full-fledged sovereign states. They had no qualms
about initiating armed conflicts with [[Europe]]an or native competitors. The
outsourcing of overseas expansion to [[Dutch]] and English merchant corporations
explains why imperial powers in northwestern [[Europe]] tended to thrive on the
toxic combination of [[warfare]] and [[treaty]]-making – to the detriment of [[indigenous]]
rulers and peoples.8 Looking at these examples reveals the ways in which [[trade]],
[[treaty]]-making and the use of armed force were inextricably intertwined.</p>
<p>[[Treaty]]-making and armed conflict in the Banda Islands9
Located 2,000 kilometres east of Java, the Banda Islands – a group of seven
small islands, including one volcano, the Gunung Api – are now a forgotten
backwater in the Republic of [[Indonesia]]. It used to be very different. For
centuries, the Spice Islands – meaning the [[North]]ern Moluccas, Ambon,
and the Banda Islands – were part of an Asian trading network connecting
the island of Java with the Philippines and the [[South]] [[China]] Sea. Merchants
from ports on Java’s north coast frequented the Banda Islands on a regular
basis, exchanging rice from Java and textiles from the [[Indian]] subcontinent
for nutmeg and mace. They brought Islam as well. As elsewhere in [[South]]east
Asia, state development was slow in the Banda Islands. Confederations of
villages, most prominently ulilima (a group of five villages) and ulisiva (a
group of nine villages), competed with each other. Orangkayas (aristocrats,
generally with wealth from [[trade]]) met on the island of Nera in order to
reduce conflict between villages and negotiate [[trade]] deals. Although the
7 This is not the first attempt to compare [[Dutch]] [[trade]] and settlement in Asia and the [[America]]s.
Almost 30 years ago, an article analysing [[Dutch]]-native relations in Formosa (now [[Taiwan]]) and
the Hudson Valley was published in the Proceedings of the [[America]]n Philosophical Society. The
authors, Hauptman and Knapp, concluded that the differences outweighed the similarities.

<p>Bandanese successfully played Javanese merchants off against each other,
they had become dependent on the spice [[trade]] for their livelihoods. Not
much was left of the islands’ original subsistence economy by the time the
first [[Europe]]ans arrived in the sixteenth century.10
Nutmeg, mace, and cloves had reached [[Europe]] via ports in the Middle
East during the Middle Ages. One of the aims of [[Europe]]an expansion into
Asia was to cut out Muslim middlemen and establish direct [[trade]] links with
the Spice Islands. The Portuguese were the first to reach the Banda Islands.
However, they were not able to establish a military presence there, in sharp
contrast with the [[North]]ern Moluccas and Ambon, where they built and
garrisoned fortresses. Nor did the Portuguese obtain any special privileges in
the Banda Islands, but [[trade]]d on the same footing as Javanese merchants.11
The situation in the Banda Islands changed dramatically when the VOC
appeared on the scene. A swift [[Dutch]] penetration into [[South]]east Asia
went hand-in-hand with naked aggression against both Portuguese and
[[indigenous]] shipping. The voyage of Pieter Willemszoon Verhoef ([[1573]]-[[1609]]),
the VOC’s so-called Fourth Voyage ([[1607]]-[[1612]]), was crucial in tipping the
balance of power in the Banda Islands. With an eye to the Twelve Years’
Truce ([[1609]]-[[1621]]) – then being negotiated between the [[Dutch]] Republic and
the [[King]] of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] – the VOC directors authorised Verhoef in
[[April]] [[1608]] to create a monopoly of [[trade]] in the Spice Islands. He received
orders to sign contracts with ‘all the villages in the Moluccas and Banda’,
and to build fortresses in strategic places, ‘with the consent of the [[Indian]]s’.
The directors’ logic was impeccable: as they noted in their letter, ‘neither the
[[King]] of [[Spain]], nor any of his subjects may visit, or [[trade]] in, those places in
Asia or [[Africa]] where we have possession or exclusive contracts’. Verhoef did
as he was told. For the first time, the Bandanese had to accept a [[Europe]]an
military presence in their country. [[Dutch]] fortresses were established on
Nera in [[1609]], on Pulo Way in [[1616]], and on [[Great]] Banda (also known as
Lonthor) in [[1621]]. Despite this, Banda’s [[indigenous]] inhabitants had no intention of surrendering without a fight, and took up arms against the VOC. An
already complex situation was complicated even further by the presence
of merchants and mariners employed by the English East India Company
(EIC), eager to secure their own trading interests.12

<p>By establishing fortresses in Asia during the Twelve Years’ Truce and
signing new, exclusive contracts with local allies, the VOC sought to tighten
up the protection/tribute exchange and strengthen its position as a co-ruler
in these territories. In the directors’ view, the VOC protected [[indigenous]]
peoples against the ‘tyranny’ of the [[King]] of [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] and had to
be rewarded by means of exclusive spice deliveries. The Bandanese saw
things differently, of course. As Adam Clulow notes, the orangkayas ‘had
long been accustomed to finding security by playing off foreign powers’.13
Until Verhoef’s arrival in the archipelago, they had treated the VOC as
simply one more merchant bidding for their produce. If and when the VOC
failed to supply the [[trade]] goods they required, such as textiles and rice, they
had been at [[liberty]] to sell their nutmeg and mace to somebody else, and
frequently did. Verhoef was determined to change that. His murder in [[May]]
[[1609]] suggests that many Bandanese objected to establishing closer ties with
the VOC through a new [[treaty]], and were desperate to avoid the construction
of a [[Dutch]] fortress. They may well have suspected that, ultimately, it would
result in a complete loss of [[indigenous]] [[sovereignty]].14
Thanks to the presence of William Keeling ([[1577]]/8-[[1620]]) in the Banda
Islands in spring [[1609]], followed by visits from other EIC merchants and
commanders, local opponents of the VOC were confident that they could play
off the English against the [[Dutch]] and thus regain control of the situation.
The Bandanese suffered from internal divisions, however. According to
[[Governor]]-General Laurens Reael ([[1583]]-[[1637]]), they governed themselves
‘entirely in a democratic fashion (populariter), like a republic’, meaning in
this case a high level of internal disunity. It may explain why they dismissed
Keeling’s suggestion to surrender their [[sovereignty]] to the [[King]] of England.
Only in [[April]] [[1616]], when VOC commander Jan Dirckszoon Lam (d. [[1626]])
was about to launch an all-out assault, did inhabitants of Pulo Way enact
a ceremony formally acknowledging James I of England as their protector.
It failed to stop Lam’s conquest of the island. But it did create a very useful
precedent for the EIC. Eight months later, Nathaniel Courthope had little

<p>difficulty persuading inhabitants of Pulu Run – many of whom were refugees
from Pulo Way – to repeat the ceremony and sign a [[treaty]] with him.15
Meanwhile, VOC officials continued to sign contracts with the Bandanese
as well, primarily with inhabitants of Rosengain and [[Great]] Banda. From
the VOC perspective, the military conquests of Nera and Pulo Way in [[1609]]
and [[1616]], respectively, had turned local populations into Company subjects.
By concluding [[treaties]] with inhabitants of Rosengain and [[Great]] Banda in
[[May]] [[1616]], [[April]] [[1617]], and [[June]] [[1618]], both Lam and Reael sought to obtain
native recognition of the changed status of Nera and Pulo Way, secure a
steady supply of nutmeg and mace for the VOC, and completely isolate Pulo
Run and its inhabitants, who had sided with the English. Although Reael
failed to launch a successful invasion of Pulo Run in the spring of [[1617]] and
[[1618]], he used all the other means at his disposal to make life difficult for
Courthope and his [[indigenous]] allies. Citing the contracts already signed
with the [[Dutch]], he forbade any contact between Bandanese allies of the
VOC and inhabitants of Pulo Run, for example. The wavering loyalties of
the Bandanese proved to be the Achilles’ heel of his strategy. In summer
[[1618]], Reael signed a truce [[treaty]] with the ‘orangkayas and magistrates’ of
Selamon only, not with any other villages on [[Great]] Banda. Those villages
had effectively sided with the inhabitants of Pulo Run.16
From the [[Dutch]] perspective, the next logical step was to [[conquer]] and
pacify [[Great]] Banda. More nutmeg trees grew on [[Great]] Banda than on all the
other islands of the archipelago combined. The inhabitants of Pulo Run were
crucially dependent for their survival on foodstuffs and water reaching them
from [[Great]] Banda. In other words, a [[Dutch]] conquest of the island would make
it impossible for the English to continue in actual possession of Pulo Run.
The strategy proved effective. Inhabitants of [[Great]] Banda repulsed Lam’s
expeditionary force in [[June]] [[1618]], but were soundly defeated by [[Governor]]General Jan Pieterszoon Coen ([[1587]]-[[1629]]) three years later. Coen commanded a
formidable naval and military force of sixteen warships and nearly a thousand
soldiers. The [[Treaty]] of Defence concluded by the VOC and EIC in London in

<p>[[June]] [[1619]] proved an unexpected benefit in pacifying the archipelago. Since the
[[companies]] were now officially allied, neither the EIC merchants in Bantam
and Jakarta, nor the few Englishmen left at Pulo Run, dared to interfere with
Coen’s invasion plans or offer any support to the Bandanese.17
Coen’s brutal conquest of [[Great]] Banda presents an inconvenient truth
for many global historians writing today who are eager to ascribe agency
to [[indigenous]] peoples through various forms of ‘negotiating’ and ‘resisting’
[[empire]]. Yet the power differential between [[Europe]]ans and certain native
groups in Asia and the [[America]]s is something that we ignore at our peril. At
the time, many Bandanese clearly underestimated the VOC’s determination
to secure a monopoly of the spice [[trade]] and the enormous resources which
it could marshal against a weak, isolated polity. Of course, there were plenty
of areas in the pre-modern world where [[Europe]]ans struggled to get a foot
in the door, but the Banda Islands were not one of these.18
Coen’s punitive expedition resulted in the near-total destruction of
Bandanese society. Forty-eight orangkayas were captured, tried, and executed at his order and approximately 789 old men, women, and [[child]]ren
were shipped off to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), the VOC headquarters
in Asia, where they were put to work as [[slaves]]. In the end, there were only
about a thousand of an estimated 15,000 original inhabitants left in the
Banda Islands. The arable land on [[Great]] Banda was divided into plots
called perken, and distributed among [[Europe]]an tenants. Many of these
so-called perkeniers were former VOC soldiers. Together with Company
officials, they would form the elite level of the new colonial society for
centuries to come. In their cultivation and harvesting of the valuable spices
they could dispose of a large labour force of [[slaves]], imported by the VOC
from all parts of Asia. The [[Dutch]] conquest, then, marked a funda[[mental]]
break with the past.19

Clulow emphasises Bandanese legal resistance against the [[Dutch]]. He shows how, through both
[[treaty]] texts and [[indigenous]] ceremonies, certain Bandanese groups successfully manipulated the
English into supporting them against the VOC. Clulow recognises, however, that the English put
their own spin on the [[treaty]] texts, and tended to overstate their case in negotiations with the
VOC. The VOC repaid the compliment, of course: it routinely over-interpreted its [[treaties]] with
[[indigenous]] rulers and peoples, if doing so served its own interest.

of the Banda Islands. Inevitably, a degree of racial mixing occurred, with perkeniers routinely</p>

<p>In this way, the Bandanese were the victims of Anglo-[[Dutch]] imperial
competition in Asia. Caught in a downward spiral of increasingly brutal
[[violence]], their room for manoeuvre diminished rapidly. Appeals for help
to EIC servants and [[indigenous]] leaders elsewhere (the rulers of Ternate,
Makassar, and Bantam, among others) went unheeded or did not have the
desired effect, in large part due to internal divisions among the Bandanese.
If there was a ‘middle ground’ in the Banda Islands (i.e. an equilibrium of
native and [[Europe]]an power), it can only have existed for a fleeting moment
in the [[1610]]s. A toxic combination of [[warfare]] and [[treaty]]-making stripped
the Bandanese of their [[sovereignty]]. From a [[Europe]]an perspective, [[treaties]]
with [[indigenous]] peoples were never meant to be agreements between
equals. Even English assistance against [[Dutch]] aggression came at a high
price for the Bandanese: according to the [[treaty]] concluded with Nathaniel
Courthope in [[December]] [[1616]], they did not just promise the EIC all spices
harvested on Pulo Run in perpetuity, but also surrendered the island to
James I of England and put themselves under the latter’s protection as
his subjects. It was all to no avail. Lacking suff icient EIC support, the
game was up for the inhabitants of Pulo Run by the time Coen arrived in
[[February]] [[1621]].20
It is instructive to compare and contrast the [[Dutch]] imperial projects in
the Hudson Valley and Banda Islands in the seventeenth century. Although
these areas are usually treated separately, there are clear parallels in terms
of [[Dutch]] claims-making and ensuing conflicts with [[indigenous]] peoples
and [[Europe]]an competitors. Thanks to the sovereign powers delegated by
the [[Dutch]] [[States]] General, the VOC and WIC were able to conclude [[treaties]]
of [[alliance]] with native peoples, impose protection/tribute exchanges on
them, and insert themselves as co-rulers in far-[[flu]]ng areas of the world.
Fortresses – even if these just consisted of blockhouses – functioned as
nuclei of [[Dutch]] [[sovereignty]], radiating in[[flu]]ence outward. Both [[companies]]
employed soldiers to enforce their own interpretations of [[treaties]] concluded
with [[indigenous]] peoples. [[War]]fare and [[treaty]]-making went hand in hand
in these imperial projects.</p>
<p>marrying slave women. Although a steady trickle of [[slaves]] escaped to other nearby archipelagos, marronage never threatened colonial society in the Banda Islands. At the end of the
eighteenth century, slave numbers had increased to 4,112, constituting three-quarters of the
islands’ population.

<p>[[Treaty]]-making and armed conflict in [[New]] Netherland
In [[September]] [[1609]], Henry Hudson – then employed by the VOC – sailed
up the river that would later be named after him. He explored it as far
as present-day Albany in [[New]] York State. The journal of Robert Juet of
Limehouse, an officer aboard the Halve Maen, reveals that Hudson engaged
in both [[trade]] and armed conflict with the various Munsee bands that lived
along the river’s shores. Juet recorded that the local people offered food and
[[tobacco]] to their uninvited guests, while also exchanging furs for [[Europe]]an
[[trade]] goods. Yet Hudson and his men lived in constant fear of a surprise
attack by the far more numerous locals – as Juet noted, we ‘durst not trust
them’. In the space of two months, a number of the local inhabitants were
captured and [[kill]]ed for supposedly posing a threat to the Halve Maen and
its crew. It was a harbinger of things to come.21 In the wake of Hudson’s
voyage, [[Dutch]] merchants visited the river in increasing numbers during
the [[1610]]s and [[1620]]s.
This period has given rise to a number of controversies over agreements
supposedly concluded between the [[Dutch]] and local groups, which must be
considered in any analysis. One such controversy centres on the Tawagonshi
Document, which the Onandaga Nation in [[New]] York State considers a
genuine [[1613]] [[treaty]] between ‘the chiefs of the Long House’ and two [[Dutch]]
merchants, Jacob Eelckens and Hendrick Christiaenssen.22 Allegedly, it
guaranteed each of the signatory parties the right to self-determination
and non-interference. If true, it would show a considerable degree of local
agency in the face of [[Europe]]an incursion. Yet there is good reason to question
the validity of this document, as historians and linguists recently did in a
special issue of the Journal of Early [[America]]n History ([[2013]]).
Jaap Jacobs notes in his contribution to this special issue that there were
no [[Dutch]] plans for settlement in the Hudson Valley prior to the WIC’s
founding. [[Dutch]] merchants simply sailed up the river for the summer
trading season. The [[companies]] that employed them were relatively shortlived enterprises, and lacked the sovereign powers that the [[Dutch]] [[States]]
General would bestow on the WIC in [[1621]]. By virtue of its charter, the [[New]]
Netherland Company ([[1614]]-[[1618]]) enjoyed a monopoly over all [[Dutch]] [[trade]]
21 Jameson, Narratives of [[New]] Netherland, pp. 18–20, p. 26; Otto, The [[Dutch]]-Munsee Encounter
in [[America]], pp. 37–47. As Paul Otto notes, archaeological evidence suggests that [[indigenous]]
peoples in the [[North]]east first obtained [[Europe]]an [[trade]] goods from [[French]] merchants on the
St. Lawrence River in the mid-sixteenth century.

perspective at least, purely private agreements.23

<p>At the same time, linguistic evidence suggests that the Tawagonshi Document cannot be a seventeenth-century [[Dutch]] text. The document – which
is only available to scholars as a [[1959]] photocopy – contains a number of
spelling and grammatical mistakes, along with Anglicisms and various
other word forms and meanings unknown to seventeenth-century [[Dutch]].
It was, in all likelihood, the handiwork of the [[America]]n physician Lawrence
G. van Loon ([[1902]]-[[1982]]), who was notorious for his forgeries of historical
documents relating to the [[history]] of [[Dutch]] [[New]] York.24
Similar concerns apply to the Two Row Wampum Belt, another controversial artifact supposedly from this period of initial contact. For the Onandaga
Nation and other [[indigenous]] groups in the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Canada]], it
symbolises the [[treaty]] allegedly concluded with the [[Dutch]] four hundred years
ago.25 Crafted from marine shell, the Two Row Wampum Belt consists of
two rows of purple beads set against a background of [[white]] beads. As Otto
notes, [[indigenous]] peoples of the Hudson Valley did not start to produce
purple beads until the [[1630]]s or later. The purple beads are made from the
dark purple section of the Quahog clam shells (Mercenaria mercinaria), the
outer surface of which is so hard as to require the use of [[Europe]]an-supplied
metal drills. These were in short supply in the Hudson Valley in [[1613]]. Although
seventeenth-century oral traditions may have associated the Two Row
Wampum Belt with an agreement between natives and [[Dutch]] merchants
concluded before the [[1630]]s, it is far more likely a recent development.26
If we do not accept the Tawagonshi Document and Two Row Wampum
Belt as reliable sources, are there other seventeenth and eighteenth-century
documents which speak to [[Europe]]an–[[indigenous]] relations in the Hudson
Valley and reflect a wider consensus about non-interference? In his contribution to the special issue of the Journal of Early [[America]]n History, the
historian Jon Parmenter accepts that the so-called Tawagonshi Document
is a fake, but argues that the [[Western]] documentary record still corroborates
the Haudenosaunee tradition of kaswentha, which stresses ‘the distinct
24 Hermkens, Noordegraaf and van der Sijs, ‘The Tawagonshi Tale’. The article suggests
that, in [[1978]], van Loon gave ‘the original piece of hide’ – which he identified as the original of
the ‘Tawagonshi [[Treaty]]’ – to two Onondaga chiefs, Leon Shenandoah and Irving Powless, for
safekeeping in the Syracuse, NY, headquarters of the People of the Longhouse. So far, scholars
have been unable to examine this ‘original piece of hide’.

<p>identity of the two peoples and a mutual engagement to coexist in peace
without interference in the affairs of the other’. According to Parmenter,
Haudenosaunee speakers explicitly mentioned or recited the kaswentha
tradition for Anglo-[[America]]n and [[French]] colonial audiences on at least fifteen
different occasions between [[1656]] and [[1744]].27 However, as Parmenter admits,
contemporary written records of negotiations between [[French]] and English
officials and the Five, later Six, Nations do not make any reference to the Two
Row Wampum Belt specifically. In his efforts to find continuity over time,
Parmenter tends to emphasise elements in the recitations that correspond with
the current concept of kaswentha, while ignoring contradictory elements.28
Parmenter is correct that the idea of a covenant chain can be found in
the Haudenosaunee recitations. But who were the [[Europe]]an interlocutors
with whom Haudenosaunee speakers wished to affirm bonds of ‘friendship’
and ‘good understanding’? According to the Jesuit Relations, a [[Mohawk]]
chief handed a ‘great collar of Porcelain beads’ (i.e. wampum beads) to the
[[French]] governor at Trois-Rivières in [[April]] [[1656]], claiming that he would tie
the [[Dutch]], the [[French]], and the ‘Agnieronnons’ together by means of this ‘iron
chain, much larger than the trees that grow in our forests’.29 The [[Mohawk]]
chief did not wish for [[Europe]]ans and native peoples to co-exist in isolation
from one another. If any misfortune should happen to the [[French]] and
‘Agnieronnons’, they would mingle their ‘weeping’ and ‘tears’. He requested
that the [[French]] governor close the doors of ‘his houses and his forts’ to the
‘Onnontageronnon’, enemies of the speaker, who were hatching ‘some plot
of war against me’.30 The [[Mohawk]] chief, then, sought [[French]] assistance
and cooperation for the next round of [[warfare]].
Such accounts show that [[indigenous]] groups sought to play off different
[[Europe]]an groups against each other. When Onondaga chiefs appeared
before the [[New]] York Commissioners for [[Indian]] Affairs in Albany in [[1678]],
they did so to ally themselves with the English as successors of the [[Dutch]].
An ‘ancient covenant’, allegedly dating back to the days of Jacob Eelckens
and Arent van Curler (two [[Dutch]] merchants who had [[trade]]d in the Hudson
Valley in the [[1610]]s and [[1630]]s), was said to have ‘continued to the Time of Old
Corlaer [Curler] and from Old Corlaer to His Present Excellency’, meaning
Sir Edmund Andros, governor of [[New]] York.31

<p>It is clear from other recitations at Albany in the years following that
[[indigenous]] peoples did not interpret the covenant chain as signifying
peaceful coexistence without interference in the affairs of the other. When
the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas affirmed their ‘covenant
of friendship’ with ‘Christians’ in [[1691]], they took it to mean that ‘whoever
should hurt or prejudice, the one should be guilty of injuring all, all of us
being comprehended in one common league’. In [[1694]], [[representative]]s of
the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, and [[Mohawk]]s recounted that
when ‘Christians’ first arrived in the Hudson Valley and were still ‘but a
Small People’, they had not just extended a hand of friendship, but also
entered into an [[alliance]] with the ‘Christians’ in order to protect the latter
‘from all enemies whatsoever’.32 This does not amount, as is claimed, to a
policy of non-interference. As late as [[1751]], Archibald [[Kennedy]] of the [[New]]
York Council echoed the Five Nations’ understanding of the covenanting
chain when he declared that ‘we [the English] have assisted them in their
wars and wants, and they have assisted us in our wars, and we have their
Furs. This is the original Contract and [[Treaty]] of Commerce with the Five
Nations.’33 On balance, the evidence suggests that the modern concept of
kaswentha was unknown to both [[Europe]]an and [[indigenous]] inhabitants
of the upper Hudson and St. Lawrence River valleys in the early modern
period. As a result, we should be cautious of reading too much into such
sources.
What can we say, then, about the situation on the ground? As Otto
shows in The [[Dutch]]-Munsee Encounter in [[America]] ([[2006]]), [[Dutch]] [[trade]] and
settlement in the lower Hudson Valley led to increasing conflict and war
with local Munsee bands in the [[1640]]s and [[1650]]s, resulting in the latter’s
submission to [[Dutch]] [[sovereignty]]. [[Europe]]an settlement, particularly land
purchases, was key in this respect. Initially, [[indigenous]] views of land
ownership and [[sovereignty]] differed radically from the [[Dutch]] perspective.
When [[Indian]] leaders signed agreements ‘selling’ their land, they agreed to
its joint use and occupancy by both themselves and the [[Dutch]]. They did
not envision anything like a permanent transfer of land or [[sovereignty]] to
recordings of [[Indian]] speech. The [[treaty]] minutes require critical analysis just like any other
historical document. Still, Richter believes that no other Euro-[[America]]n source has preserved
‘the memoir of [[Indian]] thoughts, concerns, and interpretation of events’ with less distortion than
the [[treaty]] minutes. It is, quite literally, as close as we are going to get to the words and thoughts
of illiterate [[indigenous]] peoples in the [[North]]east in the pre-modern period.

<p>the [[Dutch]]. The Munsees who ‘sold’ [[Manhattan]] island in summer [[1626]] for
[[Europe]]an [[trade]] goods worth 60 [[Dutch]] guilders continued to live there, as
did their counterparts on Staten Island, who ended up ‘selling’ the land
several times over the years. As Otto notes, land transactions served to
shore up social cohesion among the Munsees at a time when individualistic
[[trade]] exchanges with [[Europe]]an settlers tended to undermine traditional
tribal leadership. Land transactions allowed [[Indian]] leaders to reassert
their in[[flu]]ence through the distribution of gifts among tribal members.
[[Indian]] leaders may also have believed that land transactions would
ensure continued access to [[Europe]]an goods. By officially meeting [[Dutch]]
magistrates to finalise land transactions, they gave the magistrates the
impression, however, that permanent control over a territory had been
ceded, along with [[sovereignty]].34
The decline of the beaver [[trade]] in the lower Hudson Valley served to fuel
land transactions as well. No longer able to supply valuable furs, the Munsees
could offer instead food for subsistence, wampum for [[trade]], information
about the continent’s interior, and, of course, land for habitation. By [[1645]],
the [[Dutch]] population in the Hudson Valley had reached approximately
2,500. Many colonists settled in the outlying areas around [[Manhattan]] in
order to be able to [[trade]] with nearby Munsee villages.35
Increased contact between settlers and the local people resulted in greater
tension and conflict. Settlers sought to employ [[Indian]]s as domestic servants,
for example, only to find that they were not accustomed to [[Dutch]] concepts
of wage labour, and disappeared as soon as they became weary of the work.
The [[Indian]]s’ unfenced gardens, essential for their cultivation of [[corn]]s and
beans, proved vulnerable to [[Europe]]an livestock foraging freely in the woods.
To protect their [[crops]], [[Indian]]s frequently [[kill]]ed the animals. This did nothing
to improve native–[[Europe]]an relations.36
Growing [[Indian]] dependence on [[Europe]]an [[trade]] goods had a number of
dismal effects, which ranged from alcoholism among [[aboriginal]] peoples
to yet more land transactions, resulting in the loss of [[indigenous]] political
power and [[sovereignty]]. In [[January]] [[1639]], a group of [[Indian]]s that lived on
Long Island sold one-third of the island to the [[Dutch]] West India Company.
They explicitly renounced all ‘authority over it’ and placed themselves under
WIC protection, but, crucially, reserved for themselves the right ‘to remain
upon the aforesaid land, plant [[corn]], fish, hunt and make a living there as

<p>well as they can’.37 As Otto notes, this group of [[Indian]]s were undoubtedly
wampum producers who had been fully integrated into the [[Europe]]an market
economy. They required sufficient land for the year-round production of
wampum, but little else. By the [[1640]]s, wampum had become the currency
of choice for [[Europe]]an settlers in the [[Dutch]] and English colonies in the
[[North]]east (while retaining important spiritual meanings for [[aboriginal]]
peoples). Other Munsee bands that lived close to the [[Dutch]] population
centres on [[Manhattan]] faced a catastrophic situation. With little access to
beaver pelts and wampum, the Hackensacks, Tappans, and Wiechquaeskecks
found themselves surrounded by settlers and more powerful [[Indian]] groups.38
The tipping point was reached in [[September]] [[1639]] when Director Willem
Kieft decided to impose a protection/tribute exchange on all Munsee bands
living near Fort [[Amsterdam]]. [[Indian]]s whom ‘we have protected against their
enemies’ were told to pay a levy of beaver pelts, sweet [[corn]], and wampum
in order to defray the spiralling costs of [[Dutch]] garrisons and fortresses.39
Kieft’s proposals found little favour from the [[indigenous]] inhabitants of
the lower Hudson Valley. One second-hand report in [[Dutch]] suggests that
[[representative]]s of several Munsee bands travelled to Fort [[Amsterdam]] to
offer a spirited rebuttal. If this report is to be believed, a Munsee spokesman
explained to Kieft that [[Dutch]] soldiers would be totally useless to them ‘in
case of war with other nations’. It took far too long for news to reach Fort
[[Amsterdam]], ‘which was at a great distance from them’. Moreover, they
had allowed the [[Dutch]] to settle peaceably on their land, without imposing
any charge, which meant that the [[Dutch]] were ‘under obligation to them’,
not the other way around. They reminded Kieft that, for two winters in a
row, [[Dutch]]men marooned in the Hudson Valley had been cared for by the
locals, who had supplied victuals and assisted in the repair of the ship. The
Munsees had always [[trade]]d on a quid-pro-quo basis with the [[Dutch]] and
saw no reason to supply Kieft ‘with maize for nothing’. Although the [[Dutch]]
now inhabited some of their land, they were still ‘masters’ (meesters) of the
land they yet possessed. 40

leaders appeared before the Director and Council of [[New]] Netherland on 15 [[January]] [[1639]]. A

<p>As Otto notes, the underlying theme of these complaints is Munsee
frustration with the [[Dutch]] failure of social reciprocity. ‘Until this time,
the Munsees had engaged in a range of exchanges with the [[Dutch]] – food,
comfort, wampum, hospitality – which, from their perspective, kept their
world in balance.’41 Kieft’s levy presented a significant challenge to the
[[Indian]]s’ worldview. On this occasion, the giving of gifts would not be
matched with reciprocal exchanges. David de Vries, a [[Dutch]] merchant
trusted by the Munsees, witnessed their dissatisfaction first-hand in [[October]]
[[1639]]. Eager to exchange cloth for sweet [[corn]], De Vries was told by his Tappan interlocutors to wait until the WIC sloop collecting the levy had left.
Following its departure, they expressed their dismay that Kieft ‘dare […]
exact it’. The [[Dutch]] Director-General had to be ‘a very mean fellow’, first
to come to the Hudson Valley uninvited and then to command the locals
‘to give him their [[corn]] for nothing’. 42
In spring [[1640]], hostilities broke out with the native inhabitants of the
Raritan Valley (currently in northern [[New]] Jersey). Other Munsee bands
quickly became involved in the conflict as well. The First [[Dutch]]–Munsee [[War]]
lasted until [[1645]], and was marked by carnage on both sides. [[Indian]]s attacked
isolated [[Dutch]] farmsteads, [[kill]]ing colonists and livestock, while burning
down houses, barns, etc. WIC soldiers committed atrocities against [[Indian]]
villages, with the most notorious campaign led by Captain John Underhill.
Married to a [[Dutch]] woman, Underhill was a veteran of [[New]] England’s Pequot
[[War]]. He had been responsible for the massacre of an entire Pequot village at
Mystic River in [[1637]]. He reprised this feat in WIC employ in [[February]] [[1644]].
At night, he arrayed his troops around a fortified Tankitekes village near
modern Pound Ridge, [[New]] York, and ordered his men to open fire. When
the [[Indian]]s refused to fight, he ordered his men to torch the entire village,
knowing full well that the inhabitants would prefer a fiery [[death]] to slaughter
at the hands of WIC soldiers. Over five hundred [[Indian]]s were [[kill]]ed on this
occasion. According to Otto, the entire conflict cost the lives of 1,600 native
people at least. On the [[Dutch]] side, many [[Europe]]an settlers left the [[colony]] or
retreated to [[Manhattan]] island and Long Island. In [[1648]], one settler made the
dramatic claim that, apart from private [[trade]]rs and WIC personnel, there
were just one hundred colonists left in [[New]] Netherland. Yet the conflict hit

<p>the Munsees hardest. Demographic catastrophe (caused by [[Europe]]an disease)
went hand-in-hand with the collapse of [[indigenous]] political structures. For
many Munsees in the lower Hudson Valley, the overlordship that the WIC
claimed over [[New]] Netherland had become a reality. 43
[[Europe]]an migration to [[New]] Netherland recovered during Peter
Stuyvesant’s tenure as Director-General. There were about 2,000 colonists
living in the Hudson Valley by the time of the English takeover in [[1664]]. As
before, increasing population pressure resulted in conflicts with native
villages. Stuyvesant waged a Second [[Dutch]]–Munsee [[War]] in [[1655]]-[[1657]]
and took on the Esopus [[Indian]]s in [[1659]]-[[1660]]. Signif icantly, many of
the Munsee bands on Long Island – wampum producers living close to
[[Europe]]an population centres – pledged to keep the peace with Stuyvesant,
and assist him in his f ight against [[Indian]] aggressors. As Otto notes, it
was symptomatic of ‘decreasing [[Indian]] [[sovereignty]] radiating out from

<p>[[Manhattan]] Island’. 44 After [[1656]], the Munsees no longer occupied or visited
[[Manhattan]] in signif icant numbers. In [[July]] [[1657]], Staten Island – ‘by us
called Eghquaons’ – was sold to the [[Dutch]] as ‘free hereditable [[property]],
now and forever, without any further claims to be made by us or our
descendants’. 45 Signif icantly, the 20 Munsee leaders who signed the
[[property]] deed promised to come to the aid of [[Europe]]an settlers if the
latter were under attack from other [[Indian]] groups. Treaties and [[property]]
deeds now signif ied wholesale Munsee subjection to the [[Dutch]]. It was

In selling Staten Island, the Munsees received the following [[trade]] goods in return: ‘10 boxes of
shirts; 10 ells of red checked cloth; 30 pounds 30 pairs of Faroese stockings; 2 pieces of duffel;
some awls; 10 muskets; 30 kettles, large and small; 25 adzes; 10 bars of lead; 50 axes, large and

<p>understood as such by both sides. Meeting Stuyvesant at Fort Orange
(modern-day Albany) in [[July]] [[1660]], the Senecas did not just endorse his
peace [[treaty]] with the defeated Esopus [[Indian]]s, but also recognised the
[[Dutch]] as ‘masters of the country’ (ooversten vant heele landt), ‘to whom
we all look up’. 46</p>
<p>Conclusion
[[War]]fare and [[treaty]]-making were inextricably intertwined in [[Europe]]an
imperial projects. In many cases, the result was the ‘dispossession of the
native’, either by incorporating individual [[Indian]]s into colonial society, as
happened to the wampum-producing Munsees of Long Island, or by pushing
[[indigenous]] peoples out, as happened to the Esopus [[Indian]]s in the Hudson
Valley, or by exterminating the local population, as happened in the Banda

<p>Islands. Given this dismal record, was there such a thing as [[empire]] by [[treaty]]?
The case studies discussed here suggest that [[treaties]], trading contracts,
and land deeds played an important role in [[Europe]]an expansion overseas.
Crucially however, written documents were not an alternative to conflict and
war, but rather an essential part of it. These tools of [[empire]] served multiple
purposes, which ranged from diplomatic negotiations between [[Europe]]an
powers to, as Herzog puts it, ‘the subjection of all things [[indigenous]]’. 47 The
modern notion of equal [[treaties]] was totally unknown to [[Europe]]ans in the
early modern period, and, arguably, to many local rulers and peoples in
Asia and the [[America]]s. It was simply a given that relations between human
beings, whether as individuals or groups, were ordered hierarchically. High
literacy rates in northwestern [[Europe]] in the early modern period ensured
that English and [[Dutch]] colonial officials, merchants, and colonists sought
to preserve these hierarchical relations in writing. [[Indigenous]] peoples past
and present have sought to use legal systems originating in [[Europe]] to contest
the meaning of written documents and offer their own readings. Yet the
decks remain heavily stacked against them. In the early modern period, the
ultimate aim of [[treaties]] concluded between [[Europe]]ans and native rulers
and peoples was the subjection of one or more groups of human beings by
others. There is a great danger that the ‘fetishism’ of [[treaties]] will continue
to reinscribe itself in contemporary international relations.</p>
