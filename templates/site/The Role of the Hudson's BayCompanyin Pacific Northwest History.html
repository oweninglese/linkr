<p>tory."1 The governing authority of the Company
was reiterated in [[1821]] in "A Bill for regulating</p>
<p>the Fur Trade and establishing a Criminal and</p>
<p>Civil Jurisdiction within certain Parts of [[North]]
[[America]]/'2 The [[British]] [[government]] expected the
Company to maintain order, to prevent foreigners from trespassing on [[British]] soil, and to keep
the [[Indian]]s quiet. Sir George Simpson, who was
appointed governor, became responsible for profits and for peace.</p>
<p>Sir George discharged his assignment magnificently. A competitor, who at first looked
upon the appointment with condescension (Sir
George was "reputed a gentlemanly man" who</p>
<p>would "not create much alarm, nor do I presume</p>
<p>him formidable as an [[Indian]] [[trade]]r"), changed
his opinion within three years. He grumbled</p>
<p>against any [[white]] man, even its enemies. Other-</p>
<p>wise, it left the [[Indian]] to his own devices. The</p>
<p>Company made little or no deliberate effort to
impose [[Europe]]an customs on him. It played no
part in inter-tribal or inter-village quarrels. It</p>
<p>did not interfere with [[Indian]] law or justice</p>
<p>where it concerned [[Indian]]s alone. Above all,</p>
<p>while Company [[trade]]rs did on occasion trick the
[[Indian]]s, the Company itself did not cheat them
in business dealings, nor did it try to push them
off their lands or move them to another part of</p>
<p>the continent.</p>
<p>Examples of Hudson's [[Bay]] policy toward the</p>
<p>[[Indian]]s are numerous. Doubtless, some readers</p>
<p>are familiar with that part of [[America]]n folklore
which tells how Chief Factor John McLoughlin
