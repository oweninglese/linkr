<p>Wells Fargo Rejects Funding for Drilling in [[Arctic]] National Wildlife Refuge</p>
<p>Fairbanks, AK – Wells Fargo has released an update to its environ[[mental]] policy 
on [[arctic]] drilling<a href="https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/corporate-responsibility/sensitive-industries.pdf" title="link">3</a>, which included no direct finance of oil and gas projects 
in the [[Arctic]] National Wildlife Refuge. Although a no drilling policy has been 
in place since [[2018]], this latest version explicitly includes the [[Arctic]] National
Wildlife Refuge, a place sacred and essential to the livelihoods of Gwich’in and
Inupiaq peoples. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo was listed as the second-largest financier of fossil fuels in the 
world by the [[2019]] Banking on Climate Change Report<a href="https://www.ran.org/wp-content/uploads/[[2019]]/03/Banking_on_Climate_Change_[[2019]]_vFINAL1.pdf" title="link">4</a>, co-authored by the 
[[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network.</p>
<p>It must be noted that although this policy addresses the abolishment of direct 
funding of oil and gas projects, Wells Fargo is still providing corporate 
funding of fossil fuel [[companies]] who may be drilling in the [[arctic]]. </p>
<p>The following statements are provided by member organizations of the [[Indigenous]] 
Environ[[mental]] Network:</p>
<p>“For years, we have been speaking out about the need to keep drill rigs out of 
our sacred lands in the [[Arctic]] Refuge, and it’s amazing that a growing number of
major banks are listening,” said Gwich’in Steering Committee Executive Director 
Bernadette Demientieff. “The [[Arctic]] Refuge is critical to our people’s food 
security and way of life. Our human rights will not be dismissed. The fight to 
protect this place is far from over, and we will continue to hold accountable 
any bank, oil [[company]], or politician that seeks to benefit from its 
destruction.” </p>
<p>“Wells Fargo’s announcement not to fund drilling in the [[Arctic]] National Wildlife
Refuge is monu[[mental]] and tells the fossil fuel industry [[Indigenous]] lives matter 
and the [[climate]] crisis is real. In [[Alaska]] we are facing a [[climate]] crisis that is
already impacting [[Alaska]] [[Native]] communities and all [[Alaska]]ns,” states [[Native]] 
Movement organizer Siqiniq Maupin (Inupiaq). “The fossil fuel industry has taken
advantage of our communities, polluted our peoples and lands, and has divided 
people for far too long. I commend Wells Fargo for taking the initiative to 
begin to take transition steps with us, and more must be done to bring us closer
to a [[health]]y and equitable future.”</p>
<p>“I want to say Mahsi Choo (thank you very much) to the banks that are stepping 
back from funding [[Arctic]] Refuge drilling,” said Kaila Druck, Gwich’in Youth 
Council member. “We fight for not only our land but for our animals and our 
people. It makes me happy that our voices are being heard and we are making a 
change. As an [[Indigenous]] youth, I want to have a place in our homelands with 
[[health]]y animals, clean water, and pristine lands, just as our ancestors left it 
before us. Mahsii choo!”</p>
<p>“Wells Fargo’s announcement to not directly fund oil development in the [[Arctic]] 
National Wildlife Refuge is welcome news and we celebrate this as another win to
protecting our sacred lands and our way of life,” said Jody Potts, Regional 
Director, [[Native]] Movement. “We thank Wells Fargo and will continue to ask other 
financial institutions and entities to stand with the Gwich’in people who will 
never compromise when it comes to protecting the birthing grounds of the 
Porcupine Caribou Herd, which are central to our way of life and existence.” </p>
<p>“We celebrate this updated policy to protect the sacred lands of the [[Arctic]] 
National Wildlife Refuge,” said Dallas Goldtooth, IEN Keep it in the Ground 
Campaigner. “However we strongly urge Wells Fargo to keep walking on the right 
path of [[history]] and stop funding fossil fuel [[companies]] overall.” </p>
