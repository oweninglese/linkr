<p>and affirmed existing [[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights. From this recognition emerged,<br />
in [[1990]], the duty to consult as part of the justification framework allowing for the<br />
infringements of [[Aboriginal]] rights.2 The Supreme Court of [[Canada]] then went on to establish,<br />
in [[2004]], the duty to consult and, if appropriate, accommodate [[Aboriginal]] groups when the<br />
[[Crown]] undertakes an action or decision that could adversely affect their rights. This duty<br />
is triggered even if the adverse effect on their rights is not yet proven.3 This latter duty is<br />
grounded in the longstanding, though oft neglected, principle of the honour of the [[Crown]].<br />
In fact, this duty breathed new life into this principle, and affirmed that there is a special<br />
relationship between the [[Crown]] and [[Aboriginal]] peoples.5 Much litigation has followed this<br />
recognition, and now the duty to consult and accommodate is a key component of [[Aboriginal]]<br />
law. While Chief Justice Lamer recognized that [[Aboriginal]] law generally is a complex and<br />
rapidly evolving area of the law,6 the field of consultation and accommodation is particularly<br />
so. [[Aboriginal]] groups are driving this evolution, challenging the courts to grapple with new<br />
circumstances in novel settings.</p>

<h5>Tucker Volume 9: Issue 2 111</h5>
<p><code>Hupacasath First Nation ("HFN") set out earlier this year to test the outer boundaries of
this duty by asserting that the Government of [[Canada]] owed the duty to consult and accom
modate prior to the ratification of a bilateral investment agreement with [[China]]. Hupacasath
First Nation v. [[Canada]] (Minister of Forest Affairs and [[Attorney]] General)1 is the first case in which
[[Canadian]] courts have been called upon to make a determination about the existence of this
duty in the context of an international [[trade]] or investment agreement.8 The Federal Court of
[[Canada]] ("the court") dismissed HFN's application for judicial review and denied the existence
of the duty in these circumstances.9 Specifically, the court determined that the alleged adverse
impacts that could result from the ratification of this investment agreement were "speculative"
and "non-appreciable," and further, that the causal link between the agreement and the alleged
impacts was not established.
I will argue below that the court too quickly and easily dismissed HFN's concerns about
potential adverse impacts of this agreement on [[Aboriginal]] rights. Although this challenge may
seem farfetched, and could be deemed too impractical for the court to recognize, there are
nonetheless solid legal grounds for seeking this judicial review. As of the date of publication,
a determination as to whether the Hupacasath decision will be appealed has yet to be made.
If it is appealed, there will be hope for a more nuanced judicial response to this complex and
challenging case.
In part 1, I will provide a brief overview of the duty to consult and accommodate, the
investment agreement in question, and the applicant First Nation. I will then outline the facts
in the Hupacasath decision and the judgment rendered by the court in part 2. Finally, I will
comment on the weaknesses of this decision and its problematic implications.</code></p>
<ol>
<li>BACKGROUND</li>
</ol>
<p><code>1.1 Duty to Consult and Accommodate</code></p>
<h5>As noted above, the source of the duty to consult and accommodate is the honour of the</h5>
<p><code>[[Crown]], which is always at stake in the [[Crown]]s dealings with [[Aboriginal]] peoples.12 As explained
by Chief Justice McLachlin, this principle "is not a mere incantation, but rather a core precept
that finds its application in concrete practices."13 This core precept reflects an important part of
[[Canadian]] [[history]], namely that [[Crown]] [[sovereignty]] over the land that now constitutes [[Canada]]</code></p>
<h5>did not occur as a result of conquest.14 In accordance with the Royal Proclamation, [[1763]],</h5>
<p>which is presently celebrating its 250th anniversary, the [[Crown]] recognized the existing use and<br />
occupation of the lands and resources by [[Aboriginal]] peoples and, on these grounds, the need<br />
to conclude [[treaties]] prior to lawful [[Europe]]an settlement on the land.</p>

<h4>ii2 JSDLP-RDPDD Tucker</h4>
<p>There are exceptions to the rule that [[treaties]] were concluded prior to settlement. Most<br />
notably, [[treaties]] were not concluded prior to settlement in the province of [[British]] Columbia<br />
("BC"). The denial of the existence of [[Aboriginal]] tide at the time of [[Europe]]an setdement in<br />
BC has proven not only to be an immoral mistake, but an expensive one due to the protracted<br />
modern negotiation process.16 Presendy, sixty First Nations (one hundred four Bands) are part<br />
of the BC [[treaty]] negotiations process, which is a six-stage process. At this time, only two of<br />
these sixty First Nations have reached the final stage of the process, namely, the conclusion and<br />
implementation of a final agreement.<br />
Many decades may elapse between the assertion of [[Aboriginal]] rights and tide, and the<br />
conclusion of a final agreement. In the interim, the fraught issue of the use that can be made of<br />
the contested lands remains unsetded. While the duty to consult and accommodate had been<br />
recognized by the courts in various circumstances in the [[1990]]s,18 the particularly tricky issue<br />
of the use of contested lands led to the recognition of the duty to consult and accommodate<br />
as we now know it. In [[2004]], the Supreme Court issued the seminal decisions Haida Nation v.<br />
[[British]] Columbia (Minister of Forests)19 and Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. [[British]] Columbia<br />
(Project Assessment Director)}n Since then, the Supreme Court has recognized that these duties<br />
must be considered whenever [[Aboriginal]] rights and [[treaty]] rights may be adversely affected.<br />
The obligation contains two parts: 1) the duty to consult, and if appropriate; 2) the duty<br />
to accommodate. Consultation is a procedural obligation requiring the [[Crown]] to engage with<br />
[[Aboriginal]] groups and discuss in good faith their concerns regarding the impacts of the pro<br />
posed action or decision. Accommodation is the substantive obligation that arises in certain<br />
cases requiring the modification of the action or decision in response to these concerns.22 The<br />
duty to consult "arises when the [[Crown]] has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential<br />
existence of the [[Aboriginal]] right or title and contemplates conduct that might adversely affect<br />
it."23 The depth of the consultation moves along a sliding scale in response to the circumstances<br />
in question. Its scope is "proportionate to a preliminary assessment of the strength of the case<br />
supporting the existence of the right or title, and the seriousness of the potentially adverse<br />
effect upon the right or title claimed."24 Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. v. Carrier Sekani Tribal Council<br />
articulates these requirements in the form of a three-part test for deter[[mining]] whether the duty<br />
has been triggered:</p>

<p><code>(1) the [[Crown]]s knowledge, actual or constructive, of a potential [[Aboriginal]] claim or
right; (2) contemplated [[Crown]] conduct; and (3) the potential that the contemplated
conduct may adversely affect an [[Aboriginal]] claim or right.
Almost invariably, cases involving the duty to consult address decisions regarding the use
of natural resources, such as [[mining]], logging, fisheries, and oil and gas extraction.26 This reality
is unsurprising, given the strong connections between [[Aboriginal]] rights and the land and its
resources.</code></p>
<p><code>i.2 Bilateral Investment Agreement
The investment agreement under scrutiny in the Hupacasath decision is the Agreement between
the Government of [[Canada]] and the Government ofthe People's Republic of [[China]] for the Promotion
and Reciprocal Protection of Investments ("CCFIPPA").27 CCFIPPA was signed in Vladivostok,</code></p>
<h5>[[Russia]], on [[September]] 9, [[2012]].28 It is one of the latest in a series of Foreign Investment</h5>
<h5>Promotion and Protection Agreements ("FIPA"s) signed by [[Canada]], modeled on the invest</h5>
<p><code>ment chapter of the [[North]] [[America]]n Free Trade Agreement Between the Government of [[Canada]],
the Government of [[Mexico]] and the Government of the [[United]] [[States]] ("[[NAFTA]]").29 [[Canada]] has
signed approximately twenty-four such agreements since [[1993]]. However, previous FIPAs were
entered into with countries with minimal investment in [[Canada]], such as Latvia, [[Peru]], Jordan,</code></p>
<h5>and Trinidad and Tobago.30 CCFIPPA is unique in that it was entered into with [[China]], a</h5>
<p><code>major economic world player with increasing investment in [[Canada]]. As the court noted in
Hupacasath, "[[Chinese]] investment in [[Canada]] increased from approximately $228 million in</code></p>
<h5>[[2003]] to over $12 billion in [[2009]]."31 According to recent figures, [[Chinese]] investment has</h5>
<p><code>plunged, prompting the [[Governor]]-General, and the ministers of [[trade]], of foreign affairs, and
of natural resources to head to [[China]] in order to drum up business and to increase investment
flows.</code></p>
<p><code>Despite being the most significant bilateral investment agreement [[Canada]] has ever signed,
CCFIPPA has received remarkably little attention. This is in sharp contrast to the reaction of
[[Canadian]]s to [[NAFTA]]s investment chapter. This silence is significant given that certain provi</code></p>
<h5>sions in CCFIPPA are considerably more stringent than comparable provisions in [[NAFTA]].</h5>
<p><code>For example, once it comes into force, CCFIPPA will remain in force for at least fifteen years.
Thereafter, either party may terminate the agreement with a year's notice, but the investments</code></p>

<p><code>made during the initial fifteen-year period benefit from the investment protection for an addi
tional fifteen-year period.33 This extra benefit is commonly referred to as a "tail."34 [[NAFTA]], on
the other hand, allows a party to withdraw from the agreement with six months' notice, with
no initial term requirement, and without a protective tail.35 While it is true that free [[trade]]
agreements typically do not have tails, whereas investment agreements typically do,36 the initial
fifteen-year term requirement remains very unusual for both types of agreements.
CCFIPPA's arbitration clause also breaks with tradition. As with other investment agree
ments, disputes are referred to independent arbitral tribunals.38 Usually the hearings between
an investor and host Contracting Party are open to the public and all documents submitted to
the tribunal "shall be publicly available, unless the disputing parties otherwise agree."39 Under
CCFIPPA, however, the Contracting Party must determine that it is in the "public interest" to
make both the hearings and the documents open to the public, and notify the tribunal of this
determination accordingly.
The governing Conservative Party tabled CCFIPPA in the House of Commons for twenty
one days in the fall of [[2012]]. It was not debated or voted on, and the agreement may now be
ratified at any point.41 Members of Parliament ("MPs") Elizabeth [[May]] and Paul Dewar asked
for an emergency debate several times during the twenty-one-day period. The Speaker always
denied their requests.42 On one of the few occasions the issue was discussed, Conservative
MP Ed Fast responded to concerns about the implications of CCFIPPA by stating, "[[Canadian]]
investors have applauded this agreement."43 This response sheds no light on whether the other
members of the [[Canadian]] population will also benefit from the agreement.</code></p>

<h4>Ii6 JSDLP - RDPDD Tucker</h4>
<p><code>On [[April]] 29, [[2013]], HFN brought an application for judicial review seeking a declaration that
the [[Crown]] owes a duty to consult and accommodate prior to ratifying CCFIPPA,49 This decla
ration was based on the assertion that CCFIPPA could negatively affect HFN by:</code></p>
<h5>1. preventing it from "exercising its rights to conserve, manage, and protect lands,</h5>
<p><code>resources, and habitats in accordance with traditional Hupacasath laws, customs and
practices:"</code></p>
<ol>
<li>preventing it from "negotiating a [[treaty]] to protect its rights" to govern its lands,<br />
   resources, and habitat in the best interest of the Hupacasath people;</li>
<li>subjecting it to international [[trade]] and investment law, which does not respect con<br />
   stitutionally enshrined [[Aboriginal]] rights, in the event of resource use disputes with<br />
   [[Chinese]] investors;</li>
<li>causing the federal and provincial [[government]]s to be less inclined to protect its rights<br />
   and title due to the potentially "significant damage claims" that could be awarded<br />
   against it; and</li>
<li>causing the federal [[government]] and courts to be in[[flu]]enced by the rights of [[Chinese]]<br />
   investors and potential damages claims, in deter[[mining]] whether reasonable accom<br />
   modation has occurred.</li>
</ol>
<p>HFN argued that these potential negative effects would cause a "chilling effect" in the<br />
[[Canadian]] [[government]]s willingness to setde HFN's claims.51 Specifically, the protective provi<br />
sions in CCFIPPA could in[[flu]]ence the willingness of the [[government]] to allow for the protection<br />
of lands and resources for fear of being hit with an adverse arbitral award.52 Vernon MacKay,<br />
[[Crown]] witness from the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, admitted that<br />
in "developing regulatory or other policy initiatives, including measures that may be taken to<br />
accommodate [[Aboriginal]] peoples, the responsible [[government]] is strongly advised to consult<br />
with the [[government]]s Trade Law Bureau to ensure that the obligations or measures in question<br />
are consistent with [[Canada]]'s international [[trade]] and investment obligations."</p>
<p><code>2.2 Application of Three-Part Test</code></p>
<p>Chief Justice Crampton of the Federal Court of [[Canada]] determined that the first two parts<br />
of the duty to consult test were easily satisfied. Firsdy, given the existence of the BC [[treaty]]<br />
process negotiations, the [[Crown]] unquestionably has knowledge of HFN's asserted [[Aboriginal]]<br />
rights.54 Secondly, there is clearly a contemplated [[Crown]] conduct, namely the intent to ratify</p>
<p>49 The original relief also included a request for an order restraining the [[government]] from sending [[China]]<br />
the letter signaling the completion of the domestic review process, and an interlocutory injunction with<br />
the same goal, but these were removed (ibid at para 19).<br />

<p>CCFIPPA.65 The third part of the test regarding adverse effects of the action on the asserted<br />
[[Aboriginal]] rights, however, was not so easily satisfied.</p>
<p>Crampton CJ reviewed the preliminary question of whether high-level management deci<br />
sions, such as international [[treaties]], could hypothetically adversely affect [[Aboriginal]] rights or<br />
claims. He recognized that they could, even when there is no immediate impact, and even<br />
if there is the possibility of future consultation.56 The existing jurisprudence supports this<br />
position.57 After discussing this jurisprudence, he then promptly dismissed it on the grounds<br />
that these cases were all distinguishable from the present case. Specifically, the precedents<br />
involved high-level management decisions about specific lands or resources that formed part<br />
of the asserted or established [[Aboriginal]] rights.58 CCFIPPA, on the other hand, is a nation<br />
wide investment agreement, not direcdy connected to any particular piece of land or natural<br />
resource.59 The court determined that despite this distinction, "it remains important to con<br />
sider each of the principal adverse impacts on its [[Aboriginal]] rights that HFN alleges may result<br />
from the ratification of the CCFIPPA."</p>
<p>The court separated HFN s concerns about the cause of adverse effects into two cat<br />
egories: 1) CCFIPPA will cause the legal framework applicable to land and resources in [[Canada]]<br />
to change significandy; and 2) the rights granted to [[Chinese]] investors under CCFIPPA will<br />
impact the scope of self-[[government]] that HFN can achieve.</p>
<p><code>2.2.1 Significant Change in Legal Framework</code></p>
<p>HFN submitted that the ratification of CCFIPPA triggers the duty to consult "because it grants<br />
[[Chinese]] investors new, substantive, and enforceable rights with respect to the investments<br />
which they hold, or may obtain, in areas over which the HFN and other First Nations assert<br />
[[Aboriginal]] or [[treaty]] rights."62 The "minimum standard of [[treatment]]" ("MST") and "expro<br />
priation" provisions of the agreement were deemed the most likely new enforceable rights<br />
to result in awards against [[Canada]],63 and consequendy, the most likely to in[[flu]]ence govern<br />
ment behaviour. These two provisions were discussed in detail in the decision.64 Additionally,<br />
CCFIPPA's provision providing for "exceptions" to certain of the investment protections was<br />
also discussed.</p>

<p><code>i) Minimum Standard of Treatment</code></p>
<p><code>Article 4 of CCFIPPA, the MST clause, requires that investors receive "fair and equitable treat
ment and full protection and security, in accordance with international law."66 The parties dis
puted the meaning of this protection. This clause is clearly designed to protect investors against
"an unstable legal and business environment."67 HFN argued that the MST clause provides a
wide range of procedural and substantive protections, such as maintaining legitimate expecta
tions.68 The [[Crown]], in contrast, argued that it only provides "for a very low procedural 'base
iine' below which the [[treatment]] of [[Chinese]] investors may not fall."69 To support its position,
the [[Crown]] argued that although MST provisions have been interpreted expansively in the
past, resulting in numerous arbitral awards against states, this situation has been corrected.
Specifically, the [[NAFTA]] Chapter 11 Panel, in a [[2012]] decision, narrowed the scope of the MST
clause by clarifying that "changes [...] giving rise to an unstable legal and business environment"
would have to be arbitrary or grossly unfair to trigger MST protection.
Crampton CJ accepted that "there is some ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope of the
MST obligation enshrined in Article 4."72 This uncertainty is increased as a result of Article 5,
the Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment clause.73 When applied to the MST clause, Article 5 could
cause the interpretation to revert back to the earlier expansive reading by effectively negating the
language in Article 4 referring to the "customary international law" standard. Both HFN and the
[[Crown]]s expert witnesses agreed this was a possibility.74 To add to this uncertainty regarding how
this provision will be interpreted, a recent tribunal decision under the International Centre for
Setdement of Investment Disputes ("ICSID") interpreted a MST clause broadly, making the stan
dard of fair and equitable [[treatment]] of alien investors one of "reasonableness" rather than a gross
injustice.75 As such, the tribunal determined that the investor party did not need to demonstrate
an egregious conduct to trigger the MST protection.
Despite its concerns about the possible negative impacts of the MST clause on the [[Canadian]]
[[government]]s power to modify a regulatory framework, the court determined that the con</code></p>

<p>nection between these possible impacts and the asserted [[Aboriginal]] rights was speculative and<br />
non-appreciable.</p>
<p><code>ii) Expropriation</code></p>
<p>Article 10 of CCFIPPA protects investors against direct and indirect expropriation.78 In [[Canada]],<br />
there is a presumption that compensation will be provided for direct expropriation.79 Indirect<br />
expropriation is more problematic. HFN argued that this provision could affect the scope of<br />
potential measures adopted to preserve its land and resources:80 If an arbitral panel awarded<br />
damages against the federal [[government]], [[Canada]] could force HFN to repeal the offending<br />
regulatory measure in question to decrease the amount of damages to be awarded.81 On cross<br />
examination, the [[Crown]]'s witness agreed that even bona fide regulation with a public purpose<br />
may constitute expropriation under CCFIPPA. Moreover, the form of a measure taken and the<br />
intent of the state are not determinative.82 Crampton CJ again accepted that there is uncer<br />
tainty regarding the possible impacts of the expropriation provision on the ability to modify<br />
the regulatory regime without facing an adverse damages award.83 Regardless of this acknowl<br />
edgement, he determined that the possibility of these adverse impacts affecting HFN's rights<br />
was speculative and non-appreciable.</p>
<p>iii) Exceptions<br />
Specific and general exemptions from certain CCFIPPA articles exist in order to maintain<br />
some regulatory flexibility.85 This flexibility is designed to protect issues of particular public<br />
importance, such as public [[welfare]] policies, environ[[mental]] protection measures, and, most<br />
importandy for this decision, "rights and privileges accorded to [[Aboriginal]] peoples."86 The<br />
[[aboriginal]] exemption, however, does not apply to the MST or the expropriation provisions.<br />
Applying the [[Aboriginal]] exemption to these provisions would, according to the [[Crown]]s expert</p>

<p><code>witness, defeat the purpose of the [[treaty]], which is to create stability for foreign investment.
General exceptions from certain CCFIPPA articles include exceptions for the protection of
the environment. They are, however, applicable in limited circumstances. For example, they
apply when the measures are "necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or [[health]],"89 a
very high threshold. Crampton CJ accepted that there is uncertainty regarding the scope of the
specific and general exemptions. However, he stated that "it remains far from clear how this
uncertainty assists HFN to establish that the potential adverse effects on its asserted [[Aboriginal]]
rights are appreciable and non-speculative."</code></p>
<p><code>2.2.2 Scope of Self-Government</code></p>
<p>Article 2(2) of CCFIPPA states that the [[treaty]] will apply to any entity whenever it exercises a<br />
regulatory, administrative, or other [[government]] authority delegated by the Contracting Party.<br />
As explained above, HFN is in the process of seeking recognition of its right to self-govern<br />
ment. As such, it submitted that CCFIPPA will adversely impact the scope of self-[[government]]<br />
it can achieve, as it will be subject to these protections guaranteed to [[Chinese]] investors.</p>
<h5>In support of its position that Article 2(2) could one day apply to its regulatory</h5>
<p>powers, HFN pointed to a number of agreements, such as the Yekooche First Nation Agreement,<br />
the K'omoks Agreement in Principle, and the Westbank First Nation Self-Government Agreement,<br />
which specifically require First Nations' laws to be consistent with [[Canada]]'s international legal<br />
obligations. In the event of an adverse ruling by an international arbitral tribunal, these agree<br />
ments specify that First Nations must remedy their offending laws or measures.93 Crampton<br />
CJ determined that there was no causal link between CCFIPPA and these international law<br />
requirements in First Nations' agreements because [[Canada]] would likely require such a provi<br />
sion in any future [[treaty]] in any event.94 In coming to this conclusion, he did not address the</p>
<h5>additional legal obligations flowing from CCFIPPA down to the First Nation, but instead</h5>
<p>focused on the inclusion of the provision itself in an eventual agreement.<br />
The court dismissed HFN's self-governance concerns by highlighting that, at present,<br />
its regulatory capacities are limited to those provided for in the [[Indian]] Act, which involve the<br />
ability to adopt bylaws applicable on reserve only.95 HFN's assertion that its regulatory capacity<br />
goes beyond the [[Indian]] Act as a result of its Land Use Plan was also dismissed, as this Plan was</p>

<li>COMMENTARY</li>
</ol>
<h5>Crampton CJ began his judgment by repeating the Supreme Courts foundational princi</h5>
<p><code>ples regarding the [[Crown]]s duty to behave honourably and the need for reconciliation with
[[Aboriginal]] peoples.97 Despite these pronouncements, he then proceeded to focus narrowly on
the three-part test, in the process paying insufficient heed to these principles. This led not only
to the denial of HFN s request for a declaration that the [[Crown]] owed a duty to consult, but
also an award of costs against HFN. Given that this is a case involved novel issues of public
importance in which the applicant had no pecuniary interest in the outcome, that the [[Crown]]
clearly has superior capacity to bear the costs, and that the application was not vexatious or
frivolous, the awarding of costs against the First Nation was very punishing.98 Advocacy orga
nizations, such as Leadnow.ca, have mobilized to help cope with the costs award, as well as to
help fund an appeal, by fundraising on behalf of HFN. As of late [[November]], Leadnow.ca had</code></p>

<p><code>In the following section, I will comment on four particularly troubling issues with the
courts decision. Firsdy, I will review the courts determination that these alleged adverse impacts
were speculative and that there is no causal link between CCFIPPA and these impacts, with ref
erence to: a) high-level management decisions; b) the most contentious CCFIPPA provisions;
and c) the alleged chilling effect. Secondly, I will discuss the modern First Nations' agreements,
an issue that was only briefly discussed by the court. Thirdly, I will discuss CCFIPPA's deeply
inadequate environ[[mental]] assessment process. Finally, I will review the challenging circum
stances of this case that unfortunately may have dissuaded the court from ruling in HFN's
favour.</code></p>
<h5>3.1 Speculative and No Causal Link</h5>
<p><code>3.1.1 High-Level Management Decision</code></p>
<p><code>In trying to persuade the court that these provisions could impact its rights, HFN raised pos

extraction permit or the implementation of a moratorium on development over traditional

<p><code>tive and non-appreciable, and that there was no evidence of the requisite causal link.101 In fact,
demonstrating concretely that this [[Crown]] action will result in specific harm is impossible to
prove at this stage. Yet, the Supreme Court has acknowledged this evidentiary problem, rec
ognizing that the difficulty of proving this harm does not render the harm less probable, given
that high-level management decisions or structural changes
may also adversely affect [[Aboriginal]] claims or rights even if these decisions have no
"immediate impact on lands and resources": Woodward, at p. 5-41. This is because
such structural changes to the resources management may set the stage for further
decisions that will have a direct adverse impact on land and resources. For example, a
contract that transfers power over a resource from the [[Crown]] to a private party may
remove or reduce the [[Crown]]'s power to ensure that the resource is developed in a way
that respects [[Aboriginal]] interests in accordance with the honour of the [[Crown]]. The
[[Aboriginal]] people would thus effectively lose or find diminished their constitutional
right to have their interests considered in development decisions.
Crampton CJ distinguished the existing jurisprudence from HFN's case by adopting the
[[Crown]]s argument that those decisions involved regulatory regimes over lands and resources
specifically claimed by the [[Aboriginal]] group in question rather than a national agreement
that affected all [[Canadian]] territories.103 The [[Crown]] further argued that "the subject matter</code></p>
<h5>of CCFIPPA bears no relationship to resource management...Nor does it set the stage for</h5>
<p>further decisions that will have a direct adverse impact on land and resources."104 I respectfully<br />
disagree. [[Canada]]'s interest in encouraging [[Chinese]] investment has everything to do with pro<br />
viding a welcoming regulatory environment for [[Chinese]] investors to exploit [[Canadian]] natural<br />
resources. As stated by Mike Blanchfield of the [[Canadian]] Press, "[[China]] is hungry for natural<br />
resources and [[Canada]] is eager to oblige."105 Given the extent of traditional [[Aboriginal]] territo<br />
ries in [[Canada]], these natural resources will almost inevitably be found within them. Should<br />
an [[Aboriginal]] community wish to and successfully become involved in the management of<br />
natural resources on its traditional territory, [[Canada]]'s international obligations may hamper<br />
the extent of its management options, such as preventing the exploitation of the environment.</p>
<p>Although CCFIPPA certainly does not specifically target resources on [[Aboriginal]] land,<br />
if [[Chinese]] investors invest in the resources on Hupacasath traditional territory, Hupacasath<br />
claims and rights may be affected. Therefore, the distinction between this agreement and<br />
decisions that affect specific resources claimed by [[Aboriginal]] groups advanced by the court is<br />
untenable. The difference is that by the time these effects are realized, it will be too late for<br />
HFN to challenge these international investment protection standards. In the face of poten</p>

tional obligations.</code></p>
<p><code>3.1.2 MST, MFN, and Expropriation Provisions</code></p>
<p><code>With respect to specific provisions in CCFIPPA, including the MST, MFN, and expropriation
clauses, Crampton CJ acknowledged that their eventual interpretation by arbitral tribunals is
uncertain and, consequently, their possible adverse impacts on [[Aboriginal]] rights are uncertain
as well.107 This acknowledgment is problematic given that the creation of certainty for inves</code></p>
<h5>tors, via a stable regulatory environment, is precisely the purpose of CCFIPPA. The MST</h5>
<p><code>clause, in particular, is designed to establish this certainty. [[Aboriginal]] communities now bear
the burden of uncertainty, as it has been shifted to them in order to protect and encourage
foreign investment.
Two weeks after the Federal Court released its Hupacasath decision, Lone Pine Resources
Inc. filed a "Notice of Arbitration" under [[NAFTA]] against [[Canada]] under the MST and expro
priation provisions. It is claiming $250 million in damages for [[Quebec]]'s moratorium on oil
and gas [[mining]] in the St. Lawrence River.108 This example shows that HPN has a very real
reason to be concerned about the impact of the MST and expropriation provisions on environ
[[mental]] regulation. While the [[Quebec]] [[government]] may have the ability to resist the pressures
associated with such claims, a small First Nation may find it impossible to stand its ground.
Regardless of whether a tribunal will ultimate decide in Lone Pine Resources' favour, the mere
act of filing this claim may be enough to derail, or at least undermine, [[Quebec]]'s ability to
maintain this moratorium.</code></p>
<p><code>[[Chinese]] firms are "shedding their political caution and becoming increasingly aggressive in
launching legal actions to defend their interests against western [[government]]s."109 For example,
Ping An Insurance Group "launched an arbitration claim for $2 billion against Belgium last
year over the alleged expropriation of a Belgian-[[Dutch]] bank in which it had invested."</code></p>
<p><code>3.1.3 Chilling Effect</code></p>
<p><code>HFN argued that CCFIPPA could have a chilling effect on the [[government]]'s willingness to
settle its claims regarding HFN's traditional territories and recognition of its right to self-gov
ernment. In some respects it is difficult to imagine the current [[climate]] becoming any chillier.
For example, last year, [[Canada]] announced that it had adopted a new "results-based approach</code></p>

in negotiations" by focusing its resource on negotiation tables that have the "greatest potential
for success."111 Though this language sounds constructive, in practice it could allow [[Canada]] to
unilaterally suspend negotiation tables if it believes they are failing to deliver results, which it
has in fact done.</code></p>
<p><code>Proving the existence of a chilling effect is virtually impossible, particularly when the
other party refuses to acknowledge its existence. Clearly, the [[government]] wishes to increase
economic development by way of natural resource exploitation. Environ[[mental]] protection
regulations and [[Aboriginal]] rights serve to hinder reckless natural resource exploitation. The
[[government]] has already acted swiftly to undermine those environ[[mental]] regulatory hindranc
es.112 However, the constitutionally protected [[Aboriginal]] rights pose a slightly more challeng
ing hurdle. Nevertheless, the commitment to protect [[Chinese]] investors' interests in [[Canada]] is
a step toward paving the way for unfettered resource development.</code></p>
<h5>3.2 Modern First Nations' Agreements</h5>
<p>The court acknowledged in the Hupacasath decision that [[Canada]]'s argument that it need never<br />
consult with [[Aboriginal]] peoples when signing international agreements is inconsistent with<br />
modern First Nations' agreements.113 These agreements invariably include provisions specifi<br />
cally requiring consultation prior to the adoption of an international agreement.114 The Maa<br />

by a new International [[Treaty]] which would give rise to a new International Legal Obligation<br />

<p>Agreement,"8 Tsawwassen First Nation Final Agreement,119 and the Tlicho Agreement^20 all<br />
include similar provisions. Presumably, if HFN settles an agreement with [[Canada]], this provi<br />
sion will also be included.</p>
<p><code>By including this provision in First Nations' agreements, [[Canada]] recognizes that inter
national [[treaties]] may adversely affect [[Aboriginal]] rights and that the appropriate and neces
sary response is to engage in consultation. In fact, this was recognized in the [[1975]] James
[[Bay]] [[North]]ern [[Quebec]] Agreement.™ In this agreement, [[Canada]] agreed to endeavour to obtain
amendments to the Migratory Birds Convention, which it ultimately succeeded in so doing.
Crampton CJ recognized that the [[Crown]]'s argument that it is not obliged to consult with
[[Aboriginal]] groups in signing international obligations is inconsistent with their [[history]] of rec
ognizing this obligation in First Nations agreements. In spite of this, Crampton CJ refused to
impose this obligation in the case at hand. In consequence, the court has created a hierarchy
of [[Aboriginal]] rights. First Nations with agreements with [[Canada]] have established mechanisms
and recourses to address a failure to be consulted regarding the adoption of international agree
ments. [[Aboriginal]] groups without agreements may only turn to the courts for relief. If the
courts will not recognize a failure to consult in the context of international agreements, as in
the case of Hupacasath, they simply have no legal recourse.</code></p>
<h5>3.3 Environ[[mental]] Assessment of CCFIPPA</h5>
<h5>As a result of the [[2001]] Framework for Conducting Environ[[mental]] Assessments of Trade</h5>
<p><code>Negotiations, CCFIPPA was subject to an environ[[mental]] assessment ("EA").123 The two key</code></p>
<h5>objectives of the EA are "to assist [[Canadian]] negotiators integrate environ[[mental]] consider</h5>
<p><code>ations into the negotiating process by providing information on the environ[[mental]] impacts of
the proposed [[trade]] agreement; and to address public concerns."124 In requiring EAs for [[trade]]
agreements, [[Canada]] acknowledges that environ[[mental]] harm can result from these agreements.
[[Canada]] has recognized this despite the fact that these agreements constitute an exercise of the
executive's prerogative powers, perhaps the highest form of "high-level management decision."</code></p>

<h4>126 JSDLP - RDPDD Tucker</h4>
<p><code>The duty to consult and accommodate typically arises in the context of EAs because of this
recognition that the environment may be harmed.</code></p>
<p><code>There are three stages to the EA process in the context of [[trade]] negotiations: an Initial
EA, a Draft EA, and a Final EA.125 In the [[2008]] Initial EA, the [[government]] concluded that
"significant changes to investment flows into [[Canada]] are not expected as a result of these
negotiations. As such, the economic effects and likely significant environ[[mental]] impact in
[[Canada]] are expected to be minimal."126 The EA was posted for public comment for a month.
After receiving no comments, the [[government]] determined it was not necessary to conduct a
Draft EA. According to [[Canada]], it consulted various stakeholders. It did not, however, consult
[[Aboriginal]] groups.
The Final EA, posted in [[2012]], recognized that "[w]hile the findings of the Initial EA were
valid and accurate at the time of the reports completion, the results [of the Final EA]...do
differ slighdy from those found in the Initial EA"ni This change is due to the apparently unex</code></p>
<h5>pected growth in [[Chinese]] investments in [[Canada]]. Between [[2008]] and [[2011]] alone, [[Chinese]]</h5>
<p><code>investment in [[Canada]] increased by 92.4 percent.129 The questionable conclusion of the Initial
EA—based on the logic that minimal investment means minimal environ[[mental]] harm—could
no longer stand. Nevertheless, the [[government]] determined that, despite the growing rate of
[[Chinese]] investment, there are still no significant environ[[mental]] impacts expected to flow from
CCFIPPA. In support of this claim, the [[government]] argued that growing [[Chinese]] investment
in [[Canada]] "cannot be directly attributed to the presence of a FIPA." Therefore, "there can be
no causal relationship found between the implementation of such a [[treaty]] and environ[[mental]]
impacts in [[Canada]]. It is for this reason that the claim made in the Initial EA, that no signifi
cant environ[[mental]] impacts are expected based on the introduction of a [[Canada]]-[[China]] FIPA,
is upheld."
Presumably, the primary justification for signing bilateral investment agreements is to</code></p>
<h5>encourage foreign investment in [[Canada]]. The reassurances provided in the Final EA that</h5>
<p><code>CCFIPPA will not encourage investment are not reconcilable with the claim of Conservative
Party MP Peter Van Loan that the agreement will "create success, economic growth, prosperity
and jobs back here at home."
Both the Initial and Final EAs mention that [[Chinese]] investors are primarily interested
in natural resource extraction, particularly [[mining]] and oil and gas. In response to possible
concerns about the implications of these investment activities, the [[government]] provided assur
ances in its EAs that all extraction projects are subject to the [[Canadian]] environ[[mental]] regu</code></p>

<p>latory framework.132 Given [[Canada]]'s recent unraveling of decades' worth of environ[[mental]]<br />
protective legislation, this assurance provides cold comfort.</p>
<p>Instead of grappling with the possible environ[[mental]] harm that could result from this<br />
bilateral agreement, [[Canada]] disingenuously produced an EA of very little worth or substance,<br />
choosing instead to rely on flawed logic. The lack of public comments suggests that the issue<br />
was not properly publicized, and does not confirm that [[Aboriginal]] groups or non-Aborigi</p>
<h5>nal [[Canadian]]s more generally are not concerned. Public participation is a time-consuming</h5>
<p><code>process; it is nevertheless an important part of the democratic process. [[Aboriginal]] groups have
rights above and beyond the usual public participation requirements, as they form a distinct
part of the governing system in [[Canada]]. In reviewing the environ[[mental]] impacts of CCFIPPA,
[[Canada]] should have sought feedback from [[Aboriginal]] communities.</code></p>
<h5>3.4 [[Aboriginal]] Self-Governance</h5>
<p><code>Crampton CJ briefly addressed the issue of whether CCFIPPA could impact HFN's capacity to
attain and then exercise rights of self-governance. He pointed out that HFN's current regula
tory capacity is limited to the restricted provisions of the [[Indian]] Act.'33 With respect, Crampton</code></p>
<h5>CJ did not address HFN's argument. HFN is concerned about the impact of CCFIPPA not</h5>
<p><code>only on its current rights, but also on its future rights. HFN is seeking to have its right to
self-[[government]] recognized by [[Canada]]. If and when this occurs, it will have various regulatory
powers over its lands and resources.
As discussed above, CCFIPPA will apply to any entity exercising regulatory authority del
egated by the Contracting Party. In theory, [[Canada]] could argue before future arbitral tribunals
that, since [[Aboriginal]] self-governance is inherent power, not a delegated one, self-governing
[[Aboriginal]] communities do not need to conform to [[Canada]]'s international obligations. The
odds of [[Canada]] advancing this position and the tribunals accepting it, however, are small. As
such, HFN would likely be subject to the international obligations established in CCFIPPA if
it were to obtain the right to self-[[government]].</code></p>
<h5>3.5 Circumstances of Applicant</h5>
<p><code>Certain characteristics of this application for judicial review may have, though they should
not have, contributed to the court's decision to dismiss it. Firstly, a small First Nation brought
the application. The optics of a 300-member [[Aboriginal]] community challenging the authority
of the executive in conducting its international relations is not as persuasive as the optics of
an [[Aboriginal]] umbrella organization bringing the application. Yet, the size of the community
should have no bearing on the legal determination of the claim.
In fact, according to HFN, the application was brought on behalf of all First Nations.
However, as other First Nations were not parties to the proceedings, Crampton CJ dismissed
this claim.135 Four affidavits were provided in support of the application, including from</code></p>

<h5>the leadership of the Union of [[British]] Columbia [[Indian]] Chiefs and the Chiefs of [[Ontario]]</h5>
<p><code>Organization.136 These affidavits demonstrate widespread concern within the [[Aboriginal]] popu
lation about the impacts of CCFIPPA. Had either of these organizations been parties to the
proceedings, the outcome of the case may well have been different.
Another perennially challenging issue in duty to consult cases is deter[[mining]] the right
moment to bring an application.137 Perhaps if HFN had brought the application at the time of
the EA, the court would again have been less likely to dismiss these claims. That the applica
tion was brought after the signing of CCFIPPA and before its ratification may have dissuaded
the court from mandating consultation. However, [[Canada]] should not benefit from failing to
engage with [[Aboriginal]] communities during the initial negotiations.</code></p>
<ol>
<li>CONCLUSION</li>
</ol>
<p><code>I conclude this paper by citing Justice Binnie's powerful opening from the unanimous Supreme
Court decision Mikisew [[Cree]] First Nation v. [[Canada]] (Minister of [[Canadian]] Heritage):
The funda[[mental]] objective of the modern law of [[aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights is the
reconciliation of [[aboriginal]] peoples and non-[[aboriginal]] peoples and their respective
claims, interests and ambitions. The management of these relationships takes place
in the shadow of a long [[history]] of grievances and misunderstanding. The multitude
of smaller grievances created by the indifference of some [[government]] officials to
[[aboriginal]] peoples concerns, and the lack of respect inherent in that indifference has
been as destructive of the process of reconciliation as some of the larger and more
explosive controversies. And so it is in this case.138</code></p>
<h5>And so it is in this case as well. [[Aboriginal]] groups have sought consultation with the</h5>
<h5>Government of [[Canada]] regarding CCFIPPA—these requests fell upon deaf ears.139 HFN,</h5>
<h5>deeply concerned about the potential impacts of this thirty-one-year minimum bilateral</h5>
<p>investment agreement with [[China]], filed an application for judicial review asking for a declara<br />
tion that the [[government]] owes a duty to consult with First Nations groups before ratification.<br />
Rather than addressing these concerns in a meaningful or constructive manner, [[Canada]] instead<br />
engaged its legal machinery to suppress this request, even to the point of requesting costs be<br />
awarded against the First Nation.</p>
<p>In this case, the court found in favour with the [[Crown]] by narrowly applying the three-part<br />
consultation test, and by failing to consider the true meaning of the honour of the [[Crown]]. To<br />
support the request for costs, in addition, indicates a degree of deference to the [[Crown]] incom<br />
patible with the Federal Court's role as a court of equity.140 Awarding costs against vulnerable</p>
