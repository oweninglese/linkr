<p>should consider abandoning the CLC process if they have not been able to make significant

<p>but to negotiate CLC [[treaties]] to achieve their goals. Now, however, a number of institutional</p>

<p>Introduction
Over the last thirty-five years, the federal comprehensive land claims process (CLC) has</p>
<p>had a powerful effect on [[Canadian]] federalism. Since [[1973]], [[Aboriginal]] peoples and the</p>
<p>[[Crown]] have completed twenty-two modern [[treaties]]. These [[treaties]] have allowed
[[Aboriginal]] peoples to create new land management and governing regimes in the
[[Yukon]] Territory, the [[North]]west [[Territories]], [[Nunavut]], [[British]] Columbia, [[Quebec]], and</p>
<p>[[New]]foundland and Labrador (Alcantara [[2007]]a; Dacks [[2004]]; Henderson [[1994]]; Hicks
and White [[2000]]; McPherson [[2003]]; Russell [[2000]]; Rynard [[2000]]; Saku and Bone [[2000]];
White [[2002]]). Although the CLC process has become an almost hegemonic paradigm of
[[government]]-[[Aboriginal]] relations in [[Canada]], this article argues that [[Aboriginal]] groups</p>
<p>should consider abandoning the CLC process if they have not been able to make
significant progress towards completing CLC [[treaties]]. Previously, many [[Aboriginal]]
groups had no better option but to negotiate CLC [[treaties]] to achieve their goals. Now,</p>
<p>however, a number of institutional developments have given [[Aboriginal]] peoples in
[[Canada]] a range of other options that are worth pursuing instead of CLC [[treaties]].</p>
<p>The findings of this article are not limited to [[Canada]]. Other countries like the
[[United]] [[States]], [[Australia]], and [[New]] [[Zealand]] either have used [[treaties]] in the past or

<p>have thought about using them for restructuring the relationship between their
[[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] peoples (Scholtz [[2006]]; Wilkins [[2002]], 28-29). As
such, the theoretical framework of this article, with its emphasis on the interplay
between preferences, incentives, strategies, and institutions during [[treaty]] negotia</p>
<p>tions, will be of interest to international readers in other countries that have
[[indigenous]] populations seeking to achieve self-[[government]] and self-determination.
This article, which is a case study of [[Aboriginal]] [[treaty]] negotiations in [[Canada]], is
structured as follows. The first section provides some background information on</p>
<p>the CLC process in [[Canada]]. The second section constructs a theoretical framework
for understanding why many [[Aboriginal]] groups, in light of their preferences and</p>
<p>incentives, chose to enter the CLC process in the first place. The third section
briefly reviews the various reasons why some [[Aboriginal]] groups have been unable
to complete [[treaties]]. The fourth section describes the key institutional changes that</p>
<p>have broadened the option set available to those [[Aboriginal]] groups currently
involved in CLC negotiations. Finally, the article concludes by arguing that those
[[Aboriginal]] groups that have made little progress in their CLC negotiations should
explore a number of policy alternatives for achieving their preferences, at least until</p>
<p>[[government]]s make a number of funda[[mental]] changes to the CLC process (for a list
of suggested reforms, see Ladner [[2003]]; Penikett [[2006]]; RCAP [[1996]], Vol. 2; Woolford</p>
<p>[[2005]]; Abele and Prince [[2003]]).</p>
<p>Background Considerations
The [[Canadian]] federal [[government]] has established two negotiation processes
for managing its [[treaty]] relationship with [[Aboriginal]] peoples: The specific claims</p>
<p>process and the comprehensive land claims process. The purpose of the specific
claims process is to provide an alternative process (negotiations) to the courts for
resolving allegations that the [[Crown]] failed to properly interpret or implement the
terms of a [[treaty]]. Only [[Aboriginal]] groups that have completed a [[treaty]] can access</p>
<p>the specific claims process. For instance, the Blood Tribe in Alberta is currently</p>
<p>negotiating with the federal [[government]] for unpaid compensation for lands it
surrendered through a [[treaty]] in [[1889]]. In general, specific claims have proven to be</p>
<p>highly problematic and difficult to resolve (Specific Claims Branch of [[Indian]] and
[[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]], [[2006]], 2, 65).</p>
<p>The second process, and the one that is the focus of this article, is the CLC</p>
<p>process, created in [[1973]]. Up until [[1921]], the federal [[government]] had been
negotiating land surrender [[treaties]] with [[Aboriginal]] peoples in western and northern</p>
<p>[[Canada]]. In [[1921]], the federal [[government]] ended its policy of negotiating new
[[treaties]]. In its place, it employed a variety of assimilation mechanisms designed to
bring [[Aboriginal]] peoples further into mainstream society. In response, [[Aboriginal]]
peoples began to organize themselves politically in the [[1960]]s to protect their lands</p>

<p>345</p>
<p>and ways of life (Scholtz [[2006]]). The key turning point was in [[1973]], when the
Supreme Court of [[Canada]] in R. v. Colder ruled that [[Aboriginal]] title did in fact
exist. Shortly thereafter, Prime Minister [[[[Trudeau]]]] announced that his [[government]]
would begin [[treaty]] negotiations to facilitate the exchange of undefined [[Aboriginal]]
rights for a set of specific [[treaty]] rights.</p>
<p>Under the CLC process, an [[Aboriginal]] group submits a statement of intent to
the federal and relevant sub-national [[government]]s to prove three things: That its</p>
<p>rights to its claimed lands have never been extinguished; that it historically
occupied and used its claimed lands to the exclusion of other groups; and finally
that it is an identifiable and recognizable [[Aboriginal]] group ([[Indian]] and [[North]]ern
Affairs [[Canada]] 1[[998]], 5; RCAP [[1996]], 536-537). Once an [[Aboriginal]] group meets
these requirements, the three parties begin negotiating a framework agreement.</p>
<p>This agreement sets out the issues that are to be negotiated, how they will be
negotiated, and by what date they must be resolved. A comprehensive land claims
agreement can address only a limited range of issues and must in the end provide a
full, certain, and final listing of all the rights and lands that a group may have now</p>
<p>and in the future. Federal policy lists the following issues as being available for</p>
<p>negotiations:
Under this approach, the range of matters that the federal [[government]] would</p>
<p>see as subjects for negotiation could include all, some, or parts of the
following: establishment of governing structures; internal constitutions;
elections; leadership selection processes; membership; marriage; adoption and</p>
<p>[[child]] [[welfare]]; [[Aboriginal]] language; culture and religion; education; [[health]];
social services; administration/enforcement of [[Aboriginal]] laws, including the
establishment of [[Aboriginal]] courts or tribunals and the creation of offences of
the type normally created by local or regional [[government]]s for contravention
of their laws; policing; [[property]] rights, including succession and estates; land</p>
<p>management, including: zoning; service fees; land tenure and access, and
expropriation of [[Aboriginal]] land by [[Aboriginal]] [[government]]s for their own
public purposes; natural resources management; agriculture; hunting, fishing</p>
<p>and trapping on [[Aboriginal]] lands; taxation in respect of direct taxes and
[[property]] taxes of members; transfer and management of monies and group
assets; management of public works and infrastructure; housing; local
transportation; licensing, regulation and operation of businesses located on
[[Aboriginal]] lands." In the following areas, [[Aboriginal]] groups may gain some</p>
<p>power but federal and/or provincial law making authority is paramount:
"divorce; labour/training; administration of justice issues, including matters
related to the administration and enforcement of laws of other jurisdictions</p>
<p>which might include certain criminal laws; penitentiaries and parole;
environ[[mental]] protection, assessment and pollution prevention; fisheries</p>

<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>co-management; migratory birds co-management; gaming; emergency
preparedness." Finally, the federal [[government]] retains law making authority</p>
<p>over "(i) powers related to [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]], defence and external
relations; and (ii) other national interest powers ([[Indian]] and [[North]]ern Affairs</p>
<p>[[Canada]] [[1995]]).
Once a framework agreement is achieved, the parties negotiate a nonlegally
binding Agreement-in-Principle (AIP). AIP negotiations are by far the most
difficult and time-consuming part of the process. Most AIPs contain chapters on</p>
<p>eligibility and enrollment, land, access, economic development, culture and
heritage, water management, fish and wildlife, migratory birds, forest resources,
harvesting, environ[[mental]] assessment, taxation, dispute resolution, implementation,</p>
<p>compensation, and sometimes a self-[[government]] provision. The AIP does not have</p>
<p>to resolve all negotiation issues. Rather, it can leave some issues for Final
Agreement negotiations. Typically, for instance, the negotiating parties will wait</p>
<p>until Final Agreement negotiations to negotiate the exact wording of the "cede,
release, and surrender" provision and to select the actual parcels of settlement land</p>
<p>to be included in the Final Agreement.
Although it is not legally binding, the AIP usually forms the basis of the Final</p>
<p>Agreement. Previously, an AIP did not need to be ratified for Final Agreement</p>
<p>negotiations to begin. However, this policy was changed after a number of
[[Aboriginal]] communities failed to ratify their Final Agreements. To reduce the
possibility that future Final Agreements will be rejected, federal policy now requires
that all [[Aboriginal]] groups ratify their AIPs before Final Agreement negotiations can</p>
<p>begin.
The purpose of the Final Agreement is to transform the AIP into a modern
[[treaty]], formally transferring the negotiated settlement lands and land management</p>
<p>powers to the [[Aboriginal]] group. The Final Agreement also clarifies the roles and
responsibilities of each level of [[government]] in the affected lands. Once signed,
ratified, and enacted by laws passed in Parliament and the relevant sub-national
legislature, the Final Agreement becomes a constitutional document guiding future
interactions between [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] peoples affected by the [[treaty]].
In contrast to the rest of [[Canada]], [[Aboriginal]] groups in [[British]] Columbia operate
under a slightly different process. In [[1992]], the federal, provincial, and [[Aboriginal]]</p>
<p>[[government]]s in the province agreed to create the BC [[Treaty]] Commission (BCTC)
and the BCTC process. The BC [[Treaty]] Commission, which received statutory basis</p>
<p>in [[1995]], is an independent body whose job is to oversee the BC negotiation
process, facilitate negotiations, create public awareness, and administer loans to</p>
<p>participating First Nations (Abele and Prince [[2003]], 148). The BCTC negotiation
process involves six stages. Stage One, "Statement of Intent to Negotiate," involves
First Nations submitting a statement of intent to negotiate a [[treaty]]. This statement</p>

<p>must identify the negotiating body and the people that are represented by that
body. It must also show that the negotiating body has a mandate to negotiate and</p>
<p>must list the lands being claimed and all potential overlapping claims. Stage
Two, "Readiness to Negotiate," involves the three parties meeting to determine
whether they are ready to proceed to negotiations. Stage Three, "Negotiation of
a Framework Agreement," is when the parties negotiate the "table of contents" of</p>
<p>the [[treaty]]. Stage Four, "Negotiation of an Agreement In Principle," involves the
parties negotiating the details of the framework agreement. Stage Five, "Negotiation</p>
<p>to Finalize a [[Treaty]]," is the stage when the technical and legal issues are wrapped</p>
<p>up and when the parties must ratify the [[treaty]]. Stage Six, "Implementation of a
[[Treaty]]," involves the parties transforming the [[treaty]] into a living document ([[British]]</p>
<p>Columbia [[Treaty]] Commission [[2007]]).
Today, most of the uncompleted CLC claims in [[Canada]] are in [[British]] Columbia.
Of the 197 First Nations in B.C., approximately fifty-seven are currently involved in</p>
<p>the BCTC process. Outside of B.C., there are three First Nations in the [[Yukon]]
(Liard First Nation, Ross River Dena Council, and White River First Nation), one
in Labrador (the Innu), and one in the [[North]]west [[Territories]] (Deh Cho) that have
yet to complete CLC [[treaties]].
In addition to being the province with the largest number of First Nations
without [[treaties]], the BCTC process is also notable for its effect on the CLC process.</p>
<p>Two main changes to the CLC process have occurred as a result of the BCTC
process. One is the expansion of the CLC process to include concurrent negotia
tions for self-[[government]] agreements. The other is the introduction of a more
flexible certainty provision that does not require [[Aboriginal]] peoples to extinguish
their [[Aboriginal]] title when they sign [[treaties]] (Kulchyski [[2005]], 100). These changes</p>
<p>have encouraged other groups like the Labrador Inuit to sign [[treaties]] with the
[[Crown]] (Molloy [[2000]]; Alcantara [[2007]]a).</p>
<p>A Theoretical Framework for CLC Negotiations in [[Canada]]
The literature on [[Aboriginal]] [[treaties]] and self-determination is a rich and varied
one. In particular, the strength of the literature has been its insistence on the fact</p>
<p>that [[Aboriginal]] traditions and worldviews are neither easily understood nor
recognized in the world of [[Canadian]] politics and public policy (Kulchyski [[2005]];
Ladner [[2003]]; Woolford [[2005]]). Abele and Prince ([[2003]], 150-151), for instance, have
argued that comprehensive land claims negotiations in [[Canada]] have been hindered</p>
<p>by funda[[mental]] differences between [[government]] and [[Aboriginal]] understandings</p>
<p>of the [[treaty]] process (Tully [[2001]]). On the one hand, federal and provincial
[[government]]s see themselves as "[[representative]]s of the [[Crown]] meeting with
minorities within [[Canada]]" while on the other, [[Aboriginal]] peoples see themselves as</p>
<p>nations negotiating with the [[Crown]] as equals. Taiaiake Alfred ([[1999]], 119-120) goes</p>

<p>348</p>
<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>even further to say that the BCTC process "represents an advanced form of control,</p>
<p>manipulation, and assimilation ? The basic assumptions embedded in the process
and the negotiating positions put forward in relation to [[indigenous]] peoples point
to the state's innate prejudice against justice for [[indigenous]] peoples." Others, like
Patricia Monture-Angus ([[1999]]), find that western concepts like "self-[[government]]"</p>
<p>and "[[sovereignty]]" are not useful for achieving justice because they remain rooted
in the colonialist [[history]] of [[Aboriginal]] peoples and the [[Canadian]] state. Instead, she</p>
<p>advocates for [[Aboriginal]] "independence," a word that she argues is free from the
taint of the [[Crown]]'s unjust [[treatment]] of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in [[Canada]].</p>
<p>Despite the funda[[mental]] incongruence between [[Aboriginal]] and [[Canadian]]
worldviews, [[Aboriginal]] peoples and the [[Crown]] continue to negotiate [[treaties]].
Surprisingly, there has been little systematic and theoretical study of why
[[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] [[government]]s continue to negotiate [[treaties]] and why</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] peoples do not adopt the strategies advocated by Alfred, Monture
Angus, and others. The analytical framework presented in this section is an attempt</p>
<p>to theorize about why some [[Aboriginal]] groups continue to negotiate [[treaties]]
despite achieving little progress. The framework is advantageous because it is
falsifiable and can be used to make predications about the [[treaty]] process, its
participants, and its outcomes. Moreover, the framework is transferable to other
settler societies that are considering adopting [[Aboriginal]] [[treaty]] negotiation
processes like the ones used in [[Canada]].
Funda[[mental]]ly, CLC negotiations are moments in time when [[government]]s and
[[Aboriginal]] actors negotiate regime change ([[treaty]] versus no [[treaty]]). To understand</p>
<p>the dynamics of CLC negotiations, this section borrows from the "political
institutionalist" structure-agency framework that comparative scholars have
developed to explain democratic regime change. The political-institutionalist
framework explains regime change by focusing on the strategic interactions between</p>
<p>[[government]] and societal actors working for or against democratization. Actors in
this framework do not interact with each other unencumbered. Rather, they are
subject to overarching institutional structures that regulate their behavior towards
each other. In this sense, "actors make choices but not in the circumstances of their</p>
<p>choosing" (Munck [[1994]], 371).
As a number of political scientists have observed, politics is mainly about
rival actors competing for scarce resources (Hall and Taylor [[1996]], 937). CLC
negotiations are no different, with [[government]] and [[Aboriginal]] actors seeking to
negotiate [[treaties]] that maximize their preferences. Although "thin-rationalists"
argue that the contents of preferences do not matter, "thick-rationalists" argue that</p>
<p>they do matter (Shapiro and Green [[1996]], 17-19). The contents matter because if
the preferences of the actors are similar, then an agreement may be easier to
achieve. If actors have substantially different preferences, then an agreement may be</p>
<p>more difficult to achieve. Giuseppe DiPalma ([[1990]]) argues that knowing what the</p>

<p>349</p>
<p>preferences of the players are is important for understanding whether the crafting</p>
<p>of a new democratic regime will be cooperative or conflictual. If all of the
negotiating players prefer democracy, then "none of them, by definition, would be</p>
<p>facing a dilemma between regime alternatives. Further, sharing a bias for
democracy, they would therefore share a readiness to tolerate and trust each other"</p>
<p>(DiPalma [[1990]], 47).
Preferences alone do not determine outcomes nor do actors negotiate unencum
bered and without context. Rather, the negotiating actors are subject to incentives
(opportunities and constraints) that organize their strategic interactions with each
other. In other words, incentives determine whether or not the negotiating actors</p>
<p>should work towards or against a completed agreement. These incentives are
generated by the relevant institutional structures under which the actors negotiate</p>
<p>([[North]] [[1990]]). For instance, during the third wave of democratization, the urban</p>
<p>middle classes supported regime change because they believed that a new regime
would provide them with greater benefits than what they were receiving under
the existing regime (Huntington [[1991]], 67). Rueschemeyer, Stephens, and Stephens</p>
<p>([[1992]]) argue that the reason why the lower classes in authoritarian countries
pursued democratization and why the upper classes opposed it was because of
their different assessments of the relationship between their preferences on the</p>
<p>one hand, and the existing (authoritarianism) and possible future regimes
(democratization), on the other. In the same way, [[government]] and [[Aboriginal]]
actors in the comprehensive land claims process will interact with each other</p>
<p>according to their preferences and their positions within the existing
regime (no [[treaty]]) and possible future regimes (a completed [[treaty]] or other
self-[[government]] models).</p>
<p>Knill and Lenschow ([[2001]]) have criticized structural approaches for having a
determinist bias, since everything can purportedly be explained by institutions
(Knill and Lenschow [[2001]], 198). They argue that structural approaches, which are
macro in level, tend to ignore the significant role that agents can play in deter
[[mining]] outcomes. Agent-based studies, on the other hand, have shown that at the
microlevel, actors can significantly affect outcomes despite the seemingly powerful</p>
<p>in[[flu]]ence of institutions (Knill and Lenschow [[2001]], 198; Clayton and Pontusson
1[[998]]). As a result, Knill and Lenschow argue that scholars need to develop new
frameworks that account for both structure and agency.
A framework synthesizing structure and agency would have to acknowledge that
institutional structures remain important for establishing the incentives of actors
to work towards different outcomes; however, such a framework would also have</p>
<p>to specify that institutional structures do not predetermine political outcomes</p>
<p>(Encarnaci?n [[2000]], 486). In the words of Knill and Lenschow ([[2001]], 195),
"Institutions are conceived as an opportunity structure that constrains and enables</p>
<p>the behavior of self-interested actors. Institutions limit the range of strategic</p>

<p>350</p>
<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>options that are available to actors, however?in contrast to structure-based
approaches?without entirely prestructuring political decisions towards certain
outcomes."
In this approach, it is up to the negotiating actors to decide which strategies
and actions to take to achieve their preferences, subject to the incentives they face.
In the case of comprehensive land claims negotiations in [[Canada]], the relative power
that the negotiating parties have within the negotiating process is important for</p>
<p>understanding negotiation outcomes. Gerardo Munck ([[1994]]), makes a similar
observation of the democratization process: "Now to say actors have choices does
not mean that outcomes are random or that actors are equally likely to pick any set
of potential institutional designs. Probably the primary factor explaining the shape
of emerging institutions, as has been underlined by various authors, is the relative</p>
<p>power of the actors involved in the process, the rulers and the opposition"
(emphasis added) (Munck [[1994]], 370). In the case of CLCs in [[Canada]], the
outcomes of negotiations are subject to the power relations between [[government]]s
on the one hand, and the negotiating [[Aboriginal]] groups, on the other. The relative</p>
<p>power of these actors comes from the institutional structures governing CLC
negotiations. If the power relations are not balanced, then the outcomes will
depend on the ability of the weaker actors to in[[flu]]ence the stronger actors,
assuming their preferences are different (Rueschemeyer, Stephens, and Stephens
[[1992]]). In comprehensive land claims negotiations, as will be shown subsequently,
the federal, provincial, and territorial [[government]]s are the dominant actors and
benefit the most from the existing regime (no [[treaty]]). The [[Aboriginal]] actors, on the</p>
<p>other hand, are much weaker and would benefit more from negotiating a new
regime (a modern [[treaty]]).
In sum, [[government]] and [[Aboriginal]] actors in the CLC process come to the table
with their own preferences for what the process should achieve. Their propensity to
cooperate to complete a final [[treaty]] is very much in[[flu]]enced by the incentives that
emanate from the relevant institutional structures governing comprehensive land</p>
<p>claims negotiations in [[Canada]]. In the context of those incentives, the actors still
have the freedom to choose how they want to interact with each other. However,
completing a [[treaty]] requires the weaker actors ([[Aboriginal]] groups) to convince the</p>
<p>dominant actors ([[government]]s) that a completed [[treaty]] is in their interests
(Alcantara [[2007]]a). In the event that the [[Aboriginal]] groups cannot convince the
[[government]]s to complete [[treaties]], the [[Aboriginal]] groups will continue to negotiate
until viable alternatives emerge.</p>
<p>In the next section, I examine [[government]] and [[Aboriginal]] preferences (which
are internal to the groups) and incentives (which are derived from the institutional
structures governing [[treaties]] and [[treaty]] negotiations) to illustrate the usefulness of</p>
<p>this framework for understanding the dynamics of CLC negotiations in [[Canada]].</p>
<p>Specifically, I draw upon empirical evidence (interviews with [[government]] and</p>

<p>Preferences and Incentives: Some Empirical Evidence

The federal [[government]] in comprehensive land claims negotiations is primarily
interested in ensuring certainty and finality for the purposes of encouraging</p>
<p>economic development (Mitchell [[1996]], 343-344, 347; Rynard [[2000]]). It is also
interested in empowering [[Aboriginal]] peoples by helping them to increase their
capacity for governance and self-sufficiency (Serson [[2006]]; Shafto [[2006]]). According
to INAC's (1[[998]], 5) Federal Policy for the Settlement of [[Native]] Claims:</p>
<p>The primary purpose of comprehensive claims settlements is to conclude
agreements with [[Aboriginal]] groups that will resolve the debates and legal
ambiguities associated with the common law concept of [[Aboriginal]] rights and
title. Uncertainty with respect to the legal status of lands and resources, which</p>
<p>has been created by a lack of political agreement with [[Aboriginal]] groups, is a
barrier to economic development for all [[Canadian]]s and has hindered the full</p>
<p>participation of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in land and resource management.
These policy goals, especially the drive for development, have been confirmed by</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]], federal, provincial, and territorial officials (Ben Andrew [[2006]]; John
Pierre Ashini [[2006]]; Innes [[2006]]; Andersen III [[2006]]; Shafto [[2006]]; Serson [[2006]];
Mitander [[2006]]; Gingell [[2006]]). Yet [[government]] actions have not always respected or</p>
<p>benefited those [[Aboriginal]] groups whose lands were being developed. In many
instances, the federal [[government]] provided permits, tax breaks, and infrastructure</p>
<p>to encourage businesses to engage in economic development on [[Aboriginal]] lands,</p>
<p>despite opposition from [[Aboriginal]] and other stakeholder groups (Angus [[1992]],
68-69; Miller [[2000]], 365-366; Nuke [[2006]]; McPherson [[2003]], 142).</p>
<p>[[Canadian]] provincial [[government]]s are also driven by economic development
concerns. In [[New]]foundland and Labrador, for instance, Minister Ernest McLean
has said ([[2001]]), "successful land claims negotiations with the LIA [Labrador Inuit</p>
<p>Association] and the Innu will ensure economic, legal and social certainty for
governance and business and social development." Settling these claims is necessary</p>
<p>because Labrador is the key to the economic [[health]] of the entire province.
According to Minister Tom Rideout ([[2004]]),
The goal of this [[government]] is to achieve economic [[health]] for the province.</p>
<p>Building the economic [[health]] of Labrador is a key part of that plan. We are</p>
<p>building a strong foundation that will enable all regions of the province to</p>
<p>achieve their enormous potential. From what I have seen during my visit</p>

<p>to Labrador, the potential there is certainly enormous_ As we move
forward with implementing the strategy, our investments will be made where
they will have the most positive impact for all regions of the province.</p>
<p>Others have reiterated that economic development should benefit all provincial
citizens and should not be at the expense of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in the province
(Pelley [[2006]]). "It is imperative that we ensure any land claim settlement reached</p>
<p>with the Inuit and Innu are fair to all Labradorians?[[Aboriginal]] and non
[[Aboriginal]]" (Lush [[2001]]). In sum,
The provincial [[government]]'s objective in negotiating comprehensive land
claim agreements is to achieve certain and final settlement of [[Aboriginal]]
claims to territory within the Province. Certainty as to the ownership of lands</p>
<p>and how such lands are to be managed will provide a more stable environ</p>
<p>ment for development and investment_Settlement of the land claim is
necessary to provide for the long term economic and social development</p>
<p>of the province, and contribute to the economic, social and cultural
development of Labrador Inuit claimants. Negotiations are intended to
accommodate the interests of Labrador Inuit, [[government]]s and third parties</p>
<p>(Executive Council [[1997]]).
The actions of the provincial [[government]], however, do not reflect its stated</p>
<p>belief that economic development should benefit both [[Aboriginal]] and non
[[Aboriginal]] peoples. Between the [[1970]]s and [[1990]]s, the provincial [[government]]
engaged in a number of economic development projects in Labrador without
consulting the Innu or the Inuit. These projects included commercial logging,
[[mining]], fishing, hydroelectric projects, military bases, and low-level flying by
military aircrafts (Nuke [[2006]]; Rich [[2006]]; Tony Andersen [[2006]]). According to
members of both [[Aboriginal]] groups, [[government]]s and businesses have benefited
from these developments much more than the affected [[Aboriginal]] groups (John
Pierre Ashini [[2006]]; Nuke [[2006]]; Andrew [[2006]]; Riche [[2006]]; Tony Andersen [[2006]];
Jararuse [[2006]]).
Territorial [[government]]s are also very interested in economic development. The</p>
<p>[[Yukon]] territorial [[government]] has long been interested in maximizing the
development of its lands for the purposes of enhancing the well-being of its citizens</p>
<p>(McArthur [[2006]]; Penikett [[2006]]; Flynn [[2006]]; McCullough [[2006]]; McCormick [[2001]],
369; Cameron and White [[1995]], 12). It has for many years, lobbied the federal
[[government]] to transfer to it control over [[Yukon]] lands and resources (McCormick</p>
<p>[[2001]]; McArthur [[2006]]; Armour [[2006]]; McCullough [[2006]]). As in Labrador, the
[[Yukon]] territorial [[government]], the federal [[government]], and private [[companies]]</p>
<p>have long engaged in economic development on [[Yukon]] [[Indian]] lands despite the
opposition of [[Yukon]] First Nations.</p>

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Peoples and CLC Negotiations in [[Canada]]</p>
<p>In contrast, the preferences of [[Aboriginal]] groups involved in the CLC process</p>
<p>are much broader. In general, [[Aboriginal]] groups want to maximize their control
over their traditional lands to protect their traditional ways of life and practices.</p>
<p>They also want to protect their interests in and derive tangible benefits from
economic development and they desire greater control over their lives in areas such
as education, taxation, [[health]], law enforcement, environ[[mental]] protection, culture,</p>
<p>heritage, fishing, and hunting (Samson, Wilson, and Mazower [[1999]], 30-34;
Wadden [[1991]], 200; Jack [[1990]], 23; Andrew [[2006]]; Nuke [[2006]]; Porter [[2006]]; Mitander</p>
<p>[[2006]]; Joe [[2006]]; Beaudoin [[2006]]; O'Brien [[2006]]). Finally, [[Aboriginal]] peoples are
interested in acquiring justice for past wrongs, such as the restitution of their
traditional lands of which they were illegally dispossessed. Although concepts such
as rights, justice, and [[sovereignty]] are sometimes discussed at the negotiating table,</p>
<p>most of the time negotiations focus on economic and governance goals. According</p>
<p>to the interviews, I conducted with [[Aboriginal]] negotiators, civil servants, and
politicians, [[Aboriginal]] groups involved in CLC negotiations are mainly interested in</p>
<p>how the above abstract concepts can be translated into practical economic and
governance goods.
Incentives
In general, the federal, provincial and territorial [[government]]s face powerful
disincentives to complete an agreement. The actual CLC process, with its formal
rules and procedures, places [[Aboriginal]] groups in a weaker position relative to the
federal and provincial/territorial [[government]]s. The process forces [[Aboriginal]] groups
to prove to the [[government]]s that their claims are valid and therefore acceptable for
negotiations. During the actual negotiations, [[Aboriginal]] groups must adopt western</p>
<p>forms of knowledge, proof, and discourse if they want negotiations to proceed.</p>
<p>Rather than, being able to use their traditional knowledge, languages, and oral</p>
<p>histories in negotiations, they are forced to produce maps, hire [[white]]
anthropologists, linguists, lawyers and historians to prepare and document their</p>
<p>claims, and engage in formal proposal-counter proposal negotiations, all in the
English language (Samson [[2003]]; Macklem [[2001]], 271-272; Michel [[2006]]; Andrew
[[2006]]; John-Pierre Ashini [[2006]]; McPherson [[2003]], 140; Nadasdy [[2003]]; Kulchyski</p>
<p>[[2005]]). This can be a problem in [[Aboriginal]] communities where traditional
languages remain dominant. Moreover, [[Aboriginal]] groups have little power to</p>
<p>in[[flu]]ence the agenda as they can only negotiate those responsibilities and
jurisdictions that are listed under the federal comprehensive land claims policy
(INAC 1[[998]], 7-8). Finally, the [[government]] can at any time declare that certain
lands are no longer on the table for negotiation. This action, for instance, occurred
in [[1994]], when the Voisey's [[Bay]] area in Labrador was taken off the table after large
nickel deposits were found there.</p>

<p>354</p>
<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>In essence, under the CLC process, the federal, provincial and territorial
[[government]]s have become rights-granting entities while the [[Aboriginal]] groups have
become petitioners, forced to prove the validity of their claims to the [[government]]s</p>
<p>before they can receive lands, rights, self-[[government]], and jurisdictions (Samson</p>
<p>[[2003]]; Andrew [[2006]]; Backhouse and McRae [[2002]], 58). Bolstering the authority of
[[Canadian]] [[government]]s is the Constitution Act of [[1982]], which gives them a wide
range of powers over the lands, water bodies, and peoples in [[Canada]]. As mentioned</p>
<p>earlier, federal, provincial, and territorial [[government]]s have used their constitu</p>
<p>tional powers to engage in development on [[Aboriginal]] lands despite [[Aboriginal]]
opposition (Nui [[2006]]; Rich [[2006]]; Andersen III [[2006]]; Tony Andersen [[2006]]; Andrew
[[2006]]; Marshall [[2006]]).
Government incentives are also affected by the negotiation stakes. Much of the</p>
<p>powers and lands involved in comprehensive land claims negotiations involve
[[Crown]] lands and jurisdictions. The federal [[government]] tends to be interested in
cash transfers, taxation, implementation costs, fisheries, migratory birds, and
environ[[mental]] protection. The provinces, on the other hand, have jurisdiction over
inland water, economic development, renewable and nonrenewable resources, land,</p>
<p>environ[[mental]] protection, and local governance. Overall, provincial [[government]]s
have much more at stake in negotiations than the federal [[government]] (Pelley [[2006]];</p>
<p>Carter [[2006]]; Feit [[1980]]), meaning that the main task of [[Aboriginal]] groups is to
convince the provinces that a modern [[treaty]] is consistent with their interests (INAC</p>
<p>1[[998]], 6-7; Hawco [[2006]]; Rowell [[2006]]). The same can be generally said about the
territories. Traditionally, the federal [[government]] took the lead in negotiations
because it had primary jurisdiction over territorial lands and resources. However,
the territorial [[government]]s quickly became more important because the [[treaties]],</p>
<p>once completed, had a larger impact on them than on the federal [[government]]
(Armour [[2006]]; McCullough [[2006]]; McArthur [[2006]]).</p>
<p>[[Canadian]] courts have provided [[government]]s with mixed incentives. For
instance, the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] ruled in Delgamuukw v. [[British]] Columbia
([[1997]]) that the federal [[government]] can infringe upon [[Aboriginal]] rights for the
greater good of economic development. However, the [[Crown]] is still bound by its</p>
<p>fiduciary duty to take into account [[Aboriginal]] concerns prior to engaging in
development (Macklem [[2001]], 252-253). Subsequent court cases in [[2004]] have tried
to clarify the [[Crown]]'s fiduciary duty and these cases are discussed subsequently.
Other incentives to negotiate have come from a growing awareness of [[Aboriginal]]</p>
<p>rights. Former Deputy Minister of INAC Scott Serson ([[2006]]) mentioned that
federal bureaucrats and negotiators felt enormous pressure to complete [[treaties]]
after the publication of the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples (RCAP [[1996]]).
They felt they had to demonstrate that they could successfully address the concerns</p>
<p>raised in RCAP about [[treaty]] making in [[Canada]]. [[Yukon]] territorial [[government]]
officials also mentioned that in addition to legal certainty, they were interested in</p>

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Peoples and CLC Negotiations in [[Canada]]</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>correcting the historical wrongs inflicted by the [[Crown]] on [[Yukon]] First Nations</p>
<p>peoples (McCullough [[2006]]; Armour [[2006]]; Flynn [[2006]]). Floyd McCormick ([[1997]])
disagrees with these characterizations and argues that [[government]] motivations tend
to be overwhelmingly economic in nature.</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] groups, on the other hand, face powerful incentives to negotiate
a CLC [[treaty]]. First and most importantly, they have no better option to adequately
satisfy their preferences within the current institutional framework. A number of
[[Aboriginal]] officials have mentioned that the comprehensive land claims process is</p>
<p>the "only game in town" for achieving the type of control they want over their
lands (Rich [[2006]]; Riche [[2006]]; Jararuse [[2006]]; Hibbs [[2006]]; Andersen III [[2006]]; Porter</p>
<p>[[2006]]; Dick [[2006]]; Sterriah [[2006]]; Beaudoin [[2006]]). [[Aboriginal]] groups throughout</p>
<p>[[Canada]] have considered and used litigation, but judicial outcomes are
unpredictable and can be as damaging as helpful (Macklem and Townshend
[[1992]], 78-79; Monture-Angus [[1999]]; Feit [[1980]], 163; Penikett [[2006]]). Other
[[Aboriginal]] groups have used [[protest]] tactics, but these tactics do not really let
[[Aboriginal]] groups gain the type of control they want. The Innu in the [[1980]]s and
early-[[1990]]s, for instance, were one of the most active groups in [[Canada]] in using
[[[[protest]]s]] and other confrontational strategies. However, as of [[2001]], the Innu have
focused solely on negotiations because their confrontation strategies produced
uneven results (Innes [[2006]]; Riche [[2006]]; Rich [[2006]]).</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] groups face another incentive to negotiate, mainly that "once it
became clear that development was going to happen even in the absence of a
settlement, pressure began to grow at the community level to resolve claims and
to "catch a ride" on the development that was occurring" (Angus [[1992]], 71).
[[Aboriginal]] groups realize that [[government]]s will engage in economic development
on their lands anyway, so negotiating CLC [[treaties]] are the only way to ensure that
their interests are protected (Rich, [[2006]]; Jararuse [[2006]]; Joe [[2006]]; Mitander [[2006]];</p>
<p>Porter [[2006]]; Dick [[2006]]; see also McPherson [[2003]] regarding Inuit in [[Nunavut]]; and</p>
<p>Rynard [[2001]], 12-13 regarding the [[Cree]] in [[Quebec]]).2</p>
<p>Why Have Some [[Aboriginal]] Groups Failed to Complete Treaties?
Scholars have offered a number of reasons for why some [[Aboriginal]] groups have</p>
<p>been unable to complete CLC [[treaties]]. Rynard ([[2001]]), Feit ([[1980]]), and Diamond
([[1985]]) have argued that [[treaties]] get completed only when federal and provincial
[[government]]s are subject to significant economic development pressures. Others
have argued that funda[[mental]] differences in [[government]]al and [[Aboriginal]] world
views have prevented some groups from completing [[treaties]] (Abele and Prince
[[2003]], 150-151; Tully [[2001]]). Tony Penikett ([[2006]]) places the blame for incomplete
[[treaties]] on the federal, provincial, and territorial [[government]]s. Specifically, he
criticizes their inflexible political mandates, their lack of political will, and their</p>
<p>This content downloaded from

<p>356</p>
<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>failure to provide sufficient incentives to their negotiators to complete agreements</p>
<p>quickly. Finally, Alcantara ([[2007]]a) points to the importance of the [[Aboriginal]]
groups themselves in deter[[mining]] CLC negotiation outcomes. For him, one
external factor and three internal factors relative to the [[Aboriginal]] groups affect
their ability to complete [[treaties]]. These factors are: Compatible versus incompatible</p>
<p>goals (internal); frequent versus minimal use of confrontational tactics (internal);</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] group internal cohesion versus [[Aboriginal]] group internal division
(internal); and positive versus negative [[government]] perceptions of the [[Aboriginal]]</p>
<p>group (external).
Regardless of the reasons, since [[1973]], twenty-two [[Aboriginal]] groups have
completed [[treaties]] whereas many others have not. Some of these negotiations have
gone on for almost thirty-five years. In addition, most, if not all, [[Aboriginal]] groups</p>
<p>participating in the CLC process have borrowed money from the federal govern
ment to pay for their negotiating costs. In some cases, as a result of negotiations
dragging on for far too long, the amount of money that they borrowed from the</p>
<p>federal [[government]] has equaled or surpassed the amount that they were supposed
to receive under their [[treaty]] settlements (Mitander [[2006]]; Porter [[2006]]; Walsh [[2006]]).</p>
<p>As a result, a number of groups have dropped out of the CLC process, or have
shown no interest in returning to the table despite negotiating for many years. The</p>
<p>most recent group to drop out of the CLC process was the Carrier Sekani First
Nations in [[British]] Columbia, who left the negotiating table in [[March]] [[2007]] after
thirteen years. One reason why they dropped out of the process was because
their leaders decided that negotiations had become a waste of money as a result
of little progress occurring. A second reason was because, in the words of Tribal
Chief David Luggi, "While they keep us talking at the table, resource extraction
continues" on their traditional lands (Brethour [[2007]], A2).
Another group that has rejected the CLC process was the Kaska in the [[Yukon]]
Territory. The Kaska were part of the fourteen [[Yukon]] First Nations that entered the
CLC process in [[1973]]. After failing to negotiate a Final Agreement in [[June]] [[2002]], the</p>
<p>federal mandate to negotiate in the [[Yukon]] Territory expired. Although there has
been some talk of reopening negotiations over the last several years, Kaska leaders
have indicated that they are no longer interested in negotiating a CLC [[treaty]]. One</p>
<p>reason why they abandoned the [[treaty]] process was because it was too expensive
to continue negotiating. They were also frustrated that the federal and territorial
[[government]]s were using Kaska lands during negotiations. Finally, Kaska leaders felt
that the [[treaty]] process was too rigid to allow them to negotiate the type of control</p>
<p>that they want over their traditional lands (McMillan [[2006]]; Porter [[2006]]; Dixon</p>
<p>[[2006]]).</p>
<p>The reasons offered by the Carrier Sekani First Nations and the Kaska for
dropping out of the [[treaty]] process illustrate the usefulness of the structure-agency
framework described earlier. Both groups originally entered the [[treaty]] negotiation</p>

<p>357</p>
<p>process because, it was the best option available to them for achieving their
economic and political goals. Indeed, both groups negotiated for thirteen and
twenty-nine years, respectively, before dropping out of the negotiating process.</p>
<p>Their decision to drop out of process was facilitated by a number of recent
institutional developments that broaded the choice set beyond CLC negotiations.
These developments are described in the next section subsequently.</p>
<p>The Broadening of [[Aboriginal]] Options
Two institutional developments have provided negotiating [[Aboriginal]] groups with</p>
<p>a set of alternative options that are preferable to continued CLC negotiations.
The first development was two recent court decisions handed down by the Supreme</p>
<p>Court of [[Canada]] in [[2004]]. The second development was the emergence of new
policy instruments outside of the CLC process that [[Aboriginal]] groups can now use</p>
<p>to achieve their goals. These developments, which are explored in greater detail
subsequently, represent funda[[mental]] changes to the incentive structures facing
[[Aboriginal]] peoples. Whereas previously, [[Aboriginal]] peoples had no better option to
achieve their economic and political goals, they now face a set of alternatives that
are preferable to the compromises that are necessary to complete CLC [[treaties]].</p>
<p>Judicial Decisions</p>
<p>In [[November]] [[2004]], the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] handed down two crucial
decisions that had important implications for the nature of [[Aboriginal]] rights and</p>
<p>title in [[Canada]]: Haida Nation v. [[British]] Columbia (Minister of Forests), [[2004]] SCC
73, [[[2004]]] 3S.C.R. 511, and Taku River Tlingit First Nation v. [[British]] Columbia
(Project Assessment Director), [[2004]] SCC 74, [[[2004]]] 3 S.C.R. 550. In both cases, the
First Nations sought the court's help to clarify the [[Crown]]'s duty to consult and
accommodate them prior to the [[Crown]]'s development of their traditional lands.
The court ruled that prior to developing these lands, the [[Crown]] must engage in
meaningful consultation with the [[Aboriginal]] groups, and if appropriate, accom
modate their concerns. In Taku River, the court ruled that "The duty to consult
arises when a [[Crown]] actor has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential</p>
<p>existence of [[Aboriginal]] rights or title and contemplates conduct that might
adversely affect them. This in turn may lead to a duty to change [[government]] plans
or policy to accommodate [[Aboriginal]] concerns. Responsiveness is a key requirement</p>
<p>of both consultation and accommodation" (para. 25). In Haida Nation, the court
ruled that the [[government]]'s duty to consult should be "proportionate to a prelimi
nary assessment of the strength of the case supporting the existence of the right or
title, and to the seriousness of the potentially adverse effect upon the right or title</p>
<p>claimed" (para. 39). Yet, consultation and accommodation does not mean a duty
to reach agreement with an [[Aboriginal]] group. In Taku River, the court ruled that</p>

<p>358</p>
<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>"the Province was not under a duty to reach agreement with the TRTFN [Taku
River Tlingit First Nation] and its failure to do so did not breach the obligations of</p>
<p>good faith that it owned to TRTFN" (para. 22).
In essence, these rulings give [[Aboriginal]] groups greater leverage to affect the
ability of [[government]]s and private [[companies]] to use their traditional lands, even if
their rights have yet to be clarified through litigation or a [[treaty]]. At a minimum,</p>
<p>the federal and provincial [[government]]s must consult and/or accommodate any</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] groups that have some claim to the affected lands. The level of
consultation and accommodation must be proportionate to the strength of the
group's case for [[Aboriginal]] title. One way of assessing strength, according to the</p>
<p>court in Taku River (para. 32), is whether an [[Aboriginal]] group has been accepted
into [[treaty]] negotiations. If so, the [[government]]'s duty to consult and accommodate</p>
<p>is quite strong.</p>
<p>These two court decisions are important because [[Aboriginal]] groups no longer
have to rely solely on a CLC agreement to protect their interests in their traditional
lands. Now, [[Aboriginal]] groups involved in the CLC process can explore alternative</p>
<p>options that may cost less and are more effective in providing immediate
and preferable results. The rest of this article discusses three alternatives to the</p>
<p>[[treaty]] process that [[Aboriginal]] groups should consider pursuing. They are:
Self-[[government]] agreements, bilateral agreements, and the First Nations Land
Management Act.
Alternative Policy Instruments
Self-Government Agreements
Strictly speaking, a comprehensive land claims agreement is completely different</p>
<p>and separate from a self-[[government]] agreement. When the Kwanlin D?n First
Nation in the [[Yukon]] Territory completed its modern [[treaty]] with the federal and
territorial [[government]]s in [[2005]], for instance, it signed two separate documents:</p>
<p>The Kwanlin D?n First Nation Final Agreement and the Kwanlin D?n First Nation</p>
<p>Self-Government Agreement. Although it is common for [[Aboriginal]] groups to
negotiate both agreements concurrently, they are not required to do so and can
choose to negotiate only one or the other.</p>
<p>Groups that have become frustrated with comprehensive land claims negotia
tions should seriously consider focusing all of their efforts on negotiating a self
[[government]] agreement. An advantage of doing so is that it simplifies negotiations,</p>
<p>since only the [[Aboriginal]] group and the federal [[government]] are involved.
Moreover, a completed self-[[government]] agreement prior to a CLC agreement
allows the [[Aboriginal]] group to build capacity and exercise tribal [[sovereignty]] that is</p>
<p>compatible with local needs and interests. These two advantages are important
because scholars have identified them as being necessary conditions for successful</p>

<p>economic development on [[Canadian]] [[Indian]] reserves (Cornell and Kalt [[1992]];
Alcantara [[2007]]b). At Kwanlin D?n First Nation, leaders have replaced the old band</p>
<p>council structure with a Chief and Council supported by an Elders Council, a
Youth Council, the General Assembly, and a Judicial Council. Kwanlin Dun's self
[[government]] agreement also recognizes that the First Nation is a legal entity for
the purposes of borrowing, lending, and transacting. Its new [[government]] can pass</p>
<p>laws affecting language, culture, [[health]] care, training, adoption, education,
inheritance and wills, solemnization of marriage, administration of its reserve lands,</p>
<p>administration of justice, and taxation of its citizens, among other things. These
powers are more extensive and are a clear improvement on the powers available to</p>
<p>band councils under the [[Indian]] Act.3</p>
<p>One First Nation that has signed a self-[[government]] agreement prior to
completing a comprehensive land claims agreement is Westbank First Nation,
located near Kelowna, [[British]] Columbia. Westbank First Nation entered the [[British]]
Columbia [[Treaty]] Commission process in [[1994]], completing a framework agreement</p>
<p>in [[1997]]. Since then, however, the First Nation has made little progress in
negotiating an AIP with the federal and provincial [[government]]s. According to Tim</p>
<p>Raybould, Westbank's chief negotiator, "[[Treaty]] negotiations have not been
'negotiations' for many years. Governments come to the table with poorly thought</p>
<p>out take-it-or-leave-it positions that serve neither the province nor [[Canada]] well,
nor, indeed, first nations. Treaties have become way too complicated. They are not
designed to be living documents but rather 'full and final settlement,' a dangerous</p>
<p>approach that may result in future conflict. If B.C. and [[Canada]] truly want
economic certainty, they had better realize who actually needs the [[treaties]]"
(Raybould, [[2007]]). In contrast, Westbank self-[[government]] negotiations were much</p>
<p>more successful. On [[July]] 6, [[2000]], Westbank First Nation and federal negotiators
initialed the Westbank First Nation Self-Government Agreement. They brought it</p>
<p>to the community for ratification, which they did on [[May]] 24, [[2003]]. Finally, the
parties formally signed the agreement on [[October]] 3, [[2003]]. Under the agreement,</p>
<p>Westbank has been able to design its own governing institutions and exercise
a number of important powers. It has passed laws governing wills and estates,
taxation, management of reserve lands, resource management, agriculture,
environ[[mental]] protection, culture and language, education, [[health]] services, law
enforcement, traffic enforcement, public order, and public works, among other
things. Although Westbank's CLC negotiations have stalled, it has been able to use
its self-[[government]] agreement to build capacity and craft laws that are sensitive to</p>
<p>local needs.</p>
<p>Bilateral Agreements
A second option that [[Aboriginal]] groups should consider exploring is the use of
bilateral agreements with [[government]]s and private [[companies]]. These bilateral</p>

<p>360</p>
<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>agreements tend to be used to seek agreement on particular issues. For instance,
the Kaska signed a bilateral agreement with the [[Yukon]] territorial [[government]] to
co-manage the forest resources on its traditional lands (Bi-Lateral Agreement
Between the Kaska and the [[Yukon]] Government [[2003]]). The Carrier Sekani First</p>
<p>Nations in [[British]] Columbia withdrew from the [[treaty]] process in [[March]] [[2007]] to
explore bilateral agreements with private [[companies]] such as Canfor Corporation
to develop the natural resources on their lands (Brethour [[2007]], A2).
Besides the time and monetary advantages that come from negotiating specific
agreements between only two parties, bilateral agreements give [[Aboriginal]] groups</p>
<p>a number of other advantages. First, it allows the [[Aboriginal]] groups to gain
immediate control and input into the use of their lands. The decisions in Taku
River and Haida Nation require the federal and provincial/territorial [[government]]s</p>
<p>to consult and/or accommodate [[Aboriginal]] groups before issuing licenses or
engaging in development on [[Aboriginal]] lands. A second advantage of bilateral
agreements is that the [[government]]s have shown more flexibility to what they are</p>
<p>willing to agree. For instance, although the [[Yukon]] territorial [[government]] refused</p>
<p>the Kaska's demand for a veto over land use during CLC negotiations, the
territorial [[government]] was willing to accept a Kaska veto in their [[2003]] bilateral</p>
<p>agreement co-managing forest resources on Kaska lands. The preamble of this
agreement states: "WHEREAS: [[Yukon]] acknowledge, in agreements entered into
with the Kaska in [[January]] [[1997]], that the Kaska have [[Aboriginal]] rights, titles,</p>
<p>and interest in and to the Kaska Traditional Territory in the [[Yukon]]"</p>
<p>(Bi-Lateral Agreement Between the Kaska and the [[Yukon]] Government [[2003]], 1).
Under Section 3, entitled "Kaska Consent," the agreement states: "[[Yukon]] shall
not agree to any significant or major dispositions of interests in lands or resources</p>
<p>or significant or major authorizations for exploration work and resource
development in the Kaska Traditional Territory without consulting and obtaining
the consent of the Kaska" (Bi-Lateral Agreement Between the Kaska and the [[Yukon]]</p>
<p>Government [[2003]], 4). The [[Yukon]] territorial [[government]] was willing to agree to a
Kaska veto in the bilateral agreement because, it was not a [[treaty]] agreement.</p>
<p>Moreover, the [[government]] at the time was keen on developing the rich forest</p>
<p>resources on Kaska lands and was cognizant of its duty to consult and/or
accommodate Kaska interests before it could extract those resources (Armour [[2006]];</p>
<p>McCullough [[2006]]; Flynn [[2006]]).
In sum, bilateral agreements show promise in giving [[Aboriginal]] peoples
immediate and significant control over resource developments on their lands.
Moreover, bilateral agreement negotiations tend to be quicker, more cost effective,
and focused, since the stakes are lower and considerably less complex. Governments</p>
<p>have shown a willingness to be more flexible in recognizing [[Aboriginal]] rights and
title in these types of agreements than they are during comprehensive land claims
negotiations. There are limitations, however, to bilateral agreements. They tend to</p>

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Peoples and CLC Negotiations in [[Canada]]</p>
<p>be used only for resource development projects and not for other purposes like
fishing and hunting rights. Moreover, they tend to last for a specific period of time,</p>
<p>meaning that the rights that [[Aboriginal]] groups may gain in bilateral agreements
may not transfer over to future agreements.</p>
<p>First Nations Land Management Act
For those groups that are reluctant to take on the responsibilities that flow from
a self-[[government]] agreement, another option is to opt into the First Nations Land</p>
<p>Management Act (FNLMA), passed by the federal [[government]] in [[1999]]. In essence,</p>
<p>the FNLMA allows an [[Aboriginal]] group to opt out of the land management
provisions of the [[Indian]] Act to develop its own land code for managing its reserve
lands. Originally, only fourteen First Nations were allowed to participate in [[1999]].</p>
<p>Since then, forty-one bands have opted into the FNLMA, ninety have inquired</p>
<p>about doing so, and eighteen have had their land codes in operation (Alcantara</p>
<p>[[2007]]b).</p>
<p>The FNLMA provides [[Aboriginal]] groups with a number of advantages. First,
there is very little negotiating involved. Under the FNLMA, a First Nation develops</p>
<p>and drafts a land code, submits it to a jointly appointed verifier, negotiates
a funding agreement with [[Indian]] and [[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]], and then holds</p>
<p>a community vote on both the land code and the funding agreement. Once
approved, the verifier certifies the land code and the First Nation takes over all land
management responsibilities from the [[Crown]]. The average time to complete a land</p>
<p>code is three years (Isaac [[2005]]; Alcantara [[2007]]b).
Second, an [[Aboriginal]] group operating under the FNLMA benefits from capacity
building and tribal [[sovereignty]]. These groups are free to design land management
regimes as they see fit. Most land codes address individual [[property]] rights, collec</p>
<p>tive [[property]] rights, leases and licenses, matrimonial [[property]] rules, dispute
resolution involving band lands, and other law-making powers related to the
management of an [[Aboriginal]] group's lands. Some groups have designed land
management regimes that mimic off-reserve regimes, while others have combined
the efficiency of off-reserve regimes with local customs such as expropriation to</p>
<p>meet the needs of the community as a whole. At a minimum, land codes reduce
transaction costs by eliminating the involvement of the federal [[government]] in the</p>
<p>management of reserve lands (Alcantara [[2007]]b).4</p>
<p>Conclusion
This article has added to the existing literature on CLC [[treaties]] by providing
a useful theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between the
preferences and the incentives (which are derived from the relevant institu
tional structures) that drive [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] [[government]]s to</p>

<p>C. Alcantara</p>
<p>negotiate [[treaties]]. [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] actors come to the table with a</p>
<p>set of goals that they want to achieve. Their ability to achieve these goals is
in[[flu]]enced by the institutional structures governing their interactions. As well, the
outcomes of negotiations are strongly affected by the distribution of power between</p>
<p>the participating actors. In [[Canada]], the institutional structures privilege
[[government]] interests over [[Aboriginal]] ones, much to the detriment of [[Aboriginal]]</p>
<p>peoples, unless their interests happen to coincide with [[government]] ones. These</p>
<p>findings are not only applicable to [[Canada]]. Rather, other settler societies (like
[[Australia]], [[New]] [[Zealand]], and the [[United]] [[States]]) that are considering adjusting their
inter[[government]]al structures to constitutionally entrench [[Aboriginal]] [[government]]s
will find this theoretical framework highly relevant.</p>
<p>This article has also tried to argue that those [[Aboriginal]] groups that have
not been able to complete [[treaties]] within a reasonable amount of time should
consider exiting the process to pursue the alternatives described earlier. [[Aboriginal]]</p>
<p>groups should place these alternatives on a continuum. On the one end, bilateral
agreements provide [[Aboriginal]] groups with immediate control over specific uses of</p>
<p>their traditional lands. In the middle, the FNLMA gives [[Aboriginal]] groups
significant land management authority over their reserve lands, much more so than</p>
<p>bilateral agreements. At the other end of the continuum are self-[[government]]
agreements, which combine the FNLMA's land management powers with the
option of constructing governing institutions that regulate citizen behavior in
culturally sensitive ways.</p>
<p>These alternatives, however, are not without their limitations. Bilateral agree
ments tend to have expiry dates built into them and are usually limited in scope.
jSelf-[[government]] agreements and the FNLMA land codes are more permanent and
broader in nature, but they only apply to the reserve lands that the groups already</p>
<p>own. Comprehensive land claims, on the other hand, allow [[Aboriginal]] groups
to increase and make permanent the amount of lands that they can control.
Moreover, by opting into these policy alternatives, [[Aboriginal]] groups may be under
[[mining]] their ability achieve meaningful self-[[government]] and self-determination.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, [[Aboriginal]] groups that have yet to complete [[treaties]]
should consider dropping out of the process to pursue the alternatives described
earlier. These alternatives are preferable to the status quo (no [[treaties]] and [[Indian]]</p>
<p>Act governance) since, the status quo gives [[Aboriginal]] peoples the least amount
of control over their lands and peoples. They are also preferable to litigation and
[[[[protest]]s]], since such strategies sometimes generate significant legal defeats and
substantial negative publicity among non-[[Aboriginal]] [[government]] actors and the
general public. Continued [[treaty]] negotiations is also not an acceptable option for
some groups, since the theoretical framework above suggests that the process</p>
<p>is unable to accommodate [[Aboriginal]] interests and goals that are significantly
different from [[government]] ones.</p>

<p>In contrast, the alternatives described earlier are promising in two respects. First,</p>
<p>they provide [[Aboriginal]] peoples with highly useful tools for achieving some of the
essential elements of [[Aboriginal]] self-determination within a relatively short time</p>
<p>frame. Second, self-[[government]] agreements and land codes represent significant
opportunities for capacity building. The human and financial resources generated
by such alternatives can be used by [[Aboriginal]] groups to more successfully achieve</p>
<p>a broader and more just conception of [[Aboriginal]] self-determination within the</p>
<p>[[Canadian]] state.</p>
<p>Notes
The author would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers of this journal for providing</p>
<p>helpful advice on an earlier version of this manuscript.
1. As far as I can tell, the first author to use the phrase "to [[treaty]] or not to [[treaty]]" as a tide</p>
<p>or heading in a published work is Peter Sand ([[1999]]).
2. An alternative argument is that [[Aboriginal]] peoples see [[[[protest]]s]] and litigation as
important tools for creating space and recognition of [[Aboriginal]] demands. Although
[[Aboriginal]] groups did rely on such strategies to create space during the early periods of</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] mobilization, many groups have begun to turn away from such strategies
because they tend to produce unpredictable and harmful results (unpredictable judicial</p>
<p>decisions) and/or negative feelings among non-[[Aboriginal]] [[government]] actors and the</p>
<p>public (as a result of public [[[[protest]]s]], occupations, and blockades).
3. The [[Indian]] Act is a federal piece of legislation governing almost all aspects of [[Aboriginal]]
life on [[Canadian]] [[Indian]] reserves. The Act, for instance, addresses governance structures,</p>
<p>taxation rules, by law powers, membership codes, and [[property]] rights, among other
things.</p>
