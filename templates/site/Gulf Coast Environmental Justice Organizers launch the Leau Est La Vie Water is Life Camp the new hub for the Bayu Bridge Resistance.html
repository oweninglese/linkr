<p>[[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network Releases powerful video showing the impact of 
[[Bay]]ou Bridge and the plight of coastal [[Indigenous]] people in the Louisiana 
wetlands </p>
<p>Springfield, LA – Following legal victories for the Tribes at Standing Rock, 
Water Protectors in [[South]]ern Louisiana will open the L’eau Est La Vie (Water is 
Life) Camp tomorrow. The launch marks the next fight to protect [[Indigenous]] 
rights, life-giving water and to stop Energy Transfer Partners from committing 
acts of environ[[mental]] injustice.</p>
<p>The [[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network announced the opening of the camp with a 
video, highlighting, Cherri Foytlin who represents IEN’s interests in the [[Bay]]ou.
The video explains the connection between the [[Bay]]ou Bridge and Dakota Access 
Pipeline, the Houma tribe, and all people who will be impacted by these 
pipelines, and why completion of the [[Bay]]ou Bridge pipeline must be stopped.</p>
<p>Watch the video below, and learn more about the L’eau Est La Vie (Water is Life)
Camp and the lead organizers rising up on the frontlines of the fighting for 
environ[[mental]] justice to protect [[Indigenous]] rights, clean water, and rapidly 
disappearing wetlands on the Gulf Coast.</p>

<p>The following is a statement from the [[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network: 
“L’eau est La Vie camp is opening in resistance to the [[Bay]]ou Bridge Pipeline 
(BBP) another Energy Transfer Partners project. BBP is the tail end of the 
Dakota Access Pipeline that weaves from the Bakken to the fragile wetlands of 
[[South]]ern Louisiana. Once again [[Indigenous]] communities are being put in harm’s 
way and over 700 bodies of water will be threatened by one of the worst 
environ[[mental]] offenders known to date. We stand with the Water Protectors here 
in southern Louisiana to protect these critical wetlands that serve as 
protection for the people of this region from floods and storms.”</p>
<p>The following is a statement from Monique Verdin, councilwoman of the Houma 
Nation: 
“I’m not sure if we are at the head or the tail of the black snake; But we 
already got enough pipelines, 83,000 miles running through Louisiana. Miles of 
old infrastructure, built across the Mississippi River Delta’s coast decades 
ago, surrounded by a disappearing landscape in some of the most vulnerable 
territories in the world, enduring rising tides and more frequent, powerful and 
unpredictable weather conditions. Louisiana has sacrifice enough, we don’t need 
another risk of oil in our waters. It’s one thing if you can’t fish. It’s 
another thing if you can’t drink water. Over 300,000 people depend on the [[Bay]]ou 
Lafourche, for their drinking water in the heart of Houma territory. We don’t 
need another pipeline. We need clean water.”</p>
<p>The following is a statement from Cherri Foytlin, of BOLD Lousiana:
“The corporation Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) has proven themselves to be 
untrustworthy in regards to their moral responsibility to preserve both human 
and ecological rights. Whereby they have obfuscated the truth, sabotaged 
democracy, destroyed our lands and water, and even hired mercenaries to injure 
our people, we have but one recourse, and that is to say ‘you shall not pass.’ 
No [[Bay]]ou Bridge! We will stop ETP. They are not welcome here – not in our 
bayous, not in our wetlands, not in our Basin, not under our lands or through 
our waters. Period.”</p>
