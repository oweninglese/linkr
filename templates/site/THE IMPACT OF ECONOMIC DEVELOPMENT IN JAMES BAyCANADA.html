<p>THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>IN JAMES BAY, CANADA
The [[Cree]] Tallymen Speak Out
GAIL WHITEMAN
Koueraam acnooi or Management, nrasmus university</p>
<p>Although there has been a tremendous amount of past and future development in the James</p>
<p>[[Bay]] region of northern [[Canada]], there has been very little empirical [[research]] that examined</p>
<p>the impact of economic development on [[Cree]] tallymen, who are the senior grassroots man</p>
<p>agers of this vulnerable ecosystem. This oversight is particularly important because the
region is currently facing the possibility of additional large-scale hydroelectric develop
ment and there is no existing baseline information on past impacts on [[Cree]] tallymen. In
addition, tallymen continue to have important cultural significance to the [[Cree]] Nation and
also broader significance to the field of sustainable management. This article attempts to fill</p>
<p>this gap by providing ethnographic [[research]] on the impact of past development on [[Cree]] tal
lymen from the perspectives of the tallymen themselves. The author also draws implications
for environ[[mental]] impact assessments in the region and, more broadly, for the future study of</p>
<p>ecologically embedded managers such as the [[Cree]] tallymen.</p>

<p>No wonder we want to keep our land and love our land. That's how we survive—from
the land.</p>
<p>—A [[Cree]] elder and tallyman</p>
<p>On [[February]] 7, [[2002]], the provincial [[government]] of [[Québec]] and the Grand
Council of the [[Cree]]s of James [[Bay]] entered into an agreement giving [[Cree]] consent</p>
<p>to Hydro-[[Québec]]'s proposed Eastmain hydroelectric project and the diversion of
the Rupert River in exchange for $3.5 billion in [[Canadian]] currency (U.S.$2.27 bil
lion) over 50 years.1 Despite agreement at the Grand Council and local chief level,</p>
<p>there was a significant portion of the local [[Cree]] population (31%) and several
non[[government]]al organizations (NGOs) that opposed the project.2 Currently, the
project is at the environ[[mental]] impact assessment stage, which will be completed
in [[2004]].</p>
<p>This is not the first economic development project in the region. In the [[1970]]s,</p>
<p>James [[Bay]] became famous as the site of one of the world's first mega-dams, the
James [[Bay]] Project. Hydroelectric development was quickly followed by economic
development in minerals, forestry, and tourism. But the region is also called Eeyou</p>
<p>Estchee—the people's land—and has been inhabited by the James [[Bay]] [[Cree]] for at
least 5,000 years (Feit, [[1995]]). Deep cold, followed by a short growing season, are
the dominant environ[[mental]] factors of this ecosystem (Aber &amp; Melillo, [[1991]]). Un</p>
<p>predictable population dynamics are a common characteristic and inappropriate</p>

<p>resource decisions can result in sudden ecological collapse (Resilience Network,</p>
<p>[[1997]]).
Managers in James [[Bay]] are not restricted to corporate types. Within this envi
ronment, a number of local [[Indigenous]] managers grapple daily with its extreme yet</p>
<p>vulnerable ecosystem. Notably, the [[Cree]] have a sustainable cultural approach to
managing their local ecology (Berkes, [[1995]], 1[[998]], [[1999]]). [[Cree]] tallymen—senior
hunters and trappers—are the key grassroots leaders in charge of this sustainable</p>
<p>approach to management (Whiteman &amp; Cooper, [[2000]]). Tallymen are in charge of
traditional pursuits such as hunting, trapping, and fishing within specified areas
called traplines that cover the region.
Although there has been a tremendous amount of past and future development,</p>
<p>there has been very little empirical [[research]] that examined the impact of this eco</p>
<p>nomic development on [[Cree]] tallymen. This oversight is particularly important
because tallymen continue to have important cultural significance to the [[Cree]] and</p>
<p>also broader significance to the field of sustainable management (Whiteman &amp;
Cooper, [[2000]]). This article attempts to fill this gap by providing ethnographic
[[research]] on the impact of past development on [[Cree]] tallymen from the perspectives</p>
<p>of the tallymen themselves. The proposed expansion of hydroelectric development
also adds practical urgency and relevance to this information because it can provide</p>
<p>important yet [[missing]] baseline information for the environ[[mental]] impact assess
ment process.
My article is organized as follows. First, I provide background information on
the James [[Bay]] [[Cree]] and economic development in the region, including a review of</p>
<p>the literature that has examined the sociocultural impacts on the [[Cree]] in general.
Then, I describe my ethnographic study and present [[research]] findings. Next, I dis
cuss implications of these impacts for the [[Cree]] tallymen, particularly in light of the</p>
<p>proposed James [[Bay]] hydroelectric expansion. Finally, I draw some broader impli
cations for the field of sustainable management.
BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>THE JAMES BAY CREE</p>
<p>James [[Bay]] is a beautiful, sub[[arctic]] region with many lakes and enormous</p>
<p>powerful rivers. It sits at the bottom of the larger Hudson's [[Bay]] in [[Canada]]'s no</p>
<p>ern region. The [[Cree]] Nation of eastern James [[Bay]] is composed of approximate</p>
<p>12,000 [[aboriginal]] people who live in or near nine permanent village communit</p>
<p>The region is divided into 291 traplines, which are designated family huntin</p>
<p>grounds ([[Cree]] Trappers' Association [CTA], [[1996]]). Traplines range in size from</p>
<p>approximately 230 to several thousand square kilometers; the average trapline s</p>
<p>is 1,200 square kilometers (Feit, [[1985]])—larger than many cities in size. A tallym</p>
<p>manages each trapline, although other trappers and hunters (usually family m</p>
<p>bers) also use the trapline, typically after gaining permission from the tallyma</p>
<p>Despite its vulnerability to ecosystem collapse, the [[Cree]] have successfully liv
within this vulnerable and harsh ecosystem for at least 5,000 years. As Francis</p>
<p>Morantz ([[1983]]) explain, the [[Cree]] developed both a technology and social orga
zation that was suited to the demands of land surrounding them. Instead of ch</p>
<p>ing or attempting to control variability in the natural environment, the [[Cree]] learn</p>
<p>to adapt successfully despite such extremes (Berkes [[1995]], [[1999]]). To do so, th</p>
<p>[[Cree]] rely extensively on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) as a cultu</p>
<p>framework for management (Berkes, [[1999]]). TEK has been defined as "a cumu</p>

<p>Whiteman / CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 427</p>
<p>lative body of knowledge and beliefs, handed down through the generations by c</p>
<p>tural transmission, about the relationship of living beings (including humans) wit</p>
<p>one another and with their environment" (Berkes, [[1995]], p. 100). TEK is differen</p>
<p>from most [[Western]] conceptualizations of management in that it views the earth an</p>
<p>its many entities as alive and interactive, with humans as just one of many ec
system members (Deloria, [[1992]]).</p>
<p>[[Cree]] tallymen, the senior hunters who are in charge of each trapline, are th</p>
<p>key grassroots leaders of this management approach. In a previously publishe</p>
<p>ethnographic study of the [[Cree]] tallymen, my findings indicated that the tallyman</p>
<p>approach to management was ecologically embedded, a dimension that strongl
guided the sustainability of their management practice (Whiteman &amp; Cooper,</p>
<p>[[2000]]). My fieldwork indicated that [[Cree]] tallymen were ecologically embedded a</p>
<p>managers in that they personally identified with the land; adhered to beliefs of eco</p>
<p>logical respect, reciprocity, and caretaking; actively gathered firsthand ecologic</p>
<p>information; and were physically located in their local ecosystem for extensiv
periods of time. A key managerial practice of [[Cree]] tallymen was described as
"management by walking outside."</p>
<p>Overall, the tallymen's ecologically embedded knowledge, beliefs, and practic</p>
<p>formed the basis for their cultural legitimacy as leaders and decision makers abo</p>
<p>local natural resource management. Although most [[Cree]] shared many of the tall</p>
<p>men's ecologically embedded beliefs, few had such ongoing and in-depth know</p>
<p>edge or daily management experience with the local ecology. This was particular</p>
<p>true for [[Cree]] who worked in the villages in more "[[Western]]ized" jobs at the ban
council or school.</p>
<p>This earlier article also suggested that the [[Cree]] tallymen's approach may be an
interesting model for sustainable management by other non-[[Indigenous]] business
managers, an area that warranted future empirical study. However, with continued</p>
<p>pressure from economic development, the tallymen's approach may be signifi
cantly compromised.
BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN JAMES BAY
James [[Bay]] is a place of wilderness. It is also a place of increasingly aggressive
economic development. The first recorded meeting between the [[Cree]] and [[Europe]]
ans was in [[1611]] when Henry Hudson wintered in James [[Bay]] (Francis &amp; Morantz,
[[1983]]). However, the environment was harsh for outsiders and the fur [[trade]] did not
start in James [[Bay]] until the mid-17th century (Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]]). During
this colonialist period, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company ([[HBC]]) laid claim to the region
under royal charter in [[1668]] (Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]]).
There was little external [[government]] in[[flu]]ence in James [[Bay]] until the [[1930]]s and</p>
<p>[[1940]]s (Feit, [[1995]]) when Beaver Preserves were established by the [[HBC]] and the
Department of [[Indian]] Affairs to combat a severe reduction in beaver populations.3</p>
<p>By the mid-[[1930]]s, the provincial [[government]] had outlawed all [[kill]]ing of beaver.
The federal [[government]] also enacted the [[Indian]] Act of [[1947]]. At this point in time,</p>
<p>the [[Canadian]] Department of [[Indian]] Affairs now required one elected chief and
council for each fur trading post. Chiefs and band councils also were given the
authority by the [[government]] to act for the band as a whole (Feit, [[1985]]). Previously,</p>
<p>[[Cree]] leadership was more egalitarian, with the tallymen playing a more funda
[[mental]] role (Feit, [[1985]]).</p>

<p>428 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / [[December]] [[2004]]</p>
<p>In the [[1970]]s, large-scale hydroelectric development by Hydro [[Québec]] entered
James [[Bay]] (McCutcheon, [[1991]] ). Prior to this period, the land had remained largely</p>
<p>undeveloped (except for the fur [[trade]] and subsistence living) and inaccessible, with</p>
<p>outside access restricted to planes and boat transportation (Salisbury, [[1986]]). From
an economic development perspective, the James [[Bay]] Project is one of the largest
hydroelectric projects in the world. James [[Bay]] I—the initial stage of the Project—</p>
<p>is capable of producing more than 25,000 megawatts of power; the scope and scale</p>
<p>of such hydroelectric production is tremendous. The first phase of James [[Bay]] I
came on-line in [[1985]]. The road infrastructure, built to support the original hydro</p>
<p>electric development, also increased the feasibility of additional natural resource
development. By [[1997]], forestry and [[mining]] activities were becoming aggressively
pursued in the James [[Bay]] territory.</p>
<p>James [[Bay]] II was, for many years, "on hold" following an intense public rela</p>
<p>tions [[battle]] orchestrated by [[Native]] groups ([[Cree]] and Inuit) and environ[[mental]]
NGOs (see the documentary Power by Isaacson, [[1996]]). Despite this respite, hydro
electric development is again underway. Feasibility studies for the Eastmain 1-A
and Rupert diversion project are currently in progress ([[Canadian]] Environ[[mental]]</p>
<p>Assessment Agency [CEAA], [[2003]]).
According to the [[Canadian]] Environ[[mental]] Assessment Agency (CEAA), Hy
dro [[Québec]] 's plan for the diversion project outlines the following elements:
the partial diversion of the Rupert River (maximum of 800 m3/s) into the Eastmain</p>
<p>River; the construction of a power plant (maximum of770 MV) on the Eastmain 1
reservoir; and the addition of structures at the Sarcelle site, at the outlet of Opinaca
reservoir.4</p>
<p>NGOs report that the "partial" diversion of the Rupert will actually reduce the
river's flow by 92%.5 In total, the project will consist of four dams, 51 dikes, two
diversion bays (flooding an area of 395 km2), 12,000 m of diversion channels, and
two permanent access roads. Total costs are estimated at $2 billion Cdn. (U.S.$ 1.49</p>
<p>billion), with the diversion to be completed by [[2007]] and the Eastmain 1-A power</p>
<p>house online by [[2010]]. In exchange for a revenue-sharing agreement, the Grand</p>
<p>Council of the [[Cree]] of [[Quebec]] (GCCQ) has agreed not to publicly oppose the
project.
Ted Moses, Grand Chief of the GCCQ and a chief negotiator for the Peace of the</p>
<p>Brave Agreement, explained the Grand Council's rationale for accepting future
economic development in the following way:
What are the real alternatives? Where are we going to get jobs? How are we going
to be able to take care of our [[child]]ren? What is going to happen 25 years from now,</p>
<p>when we have 25,000 people looking for work and a place to live?6</p>
<p>Sociocultural Impact of
Economic Development on the [[Cree]]
The fur [[trade]] resulted in a number of changes in [[Cree]] culture and society.
Francis and Morantz ([[1983]]) suggest that "the fur [[trade]] in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries probably underscored the development of smaller social</p>
<p>groups and more individualized ownership of resources among the [[Indian]]s"
(p. 97). Although historically it appears that the [[Cree]] spent the winter hunting and
trapping in groups up to 50 people, the fur [[trade]] tended to reduce group size "since</p>

<p>Whiteman / CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 429</p>
<p>they required less food resources in a given area and provided a higher per cap</p>
<p>yield of furs" (p. 97). In addition, the fur [[trade]] appears to have more concrete</p>
<p>delineated family hunting territories, although the existence of hunting territori</p>
<p>does not appear to be a fur [[trade]] invention (Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]]). Althoug</p>
<p>historical accounts of the fur [[trade]] often position native peoples as passive victims
the fur [[trade]], in many ways, was a partnership of mutual benefit, with the [[Cree]]</p>
<p>playing economic independence and shifting [[trade]] advantageously between th</p>
<p>[[HBC]] and the [[French]] [[trade]]rs (Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]]). However, this is n</p>
<p>meant to imply that it was an equal partnership and it remains open to colonial
criticisms.</p>
<p>With the advent of the fur [[trade]], [[Cree]] summer settlements became located at th</p>
<p>[[HBC]] trading posts. Following nomadic hunting patterns, the [[Cree]] traditionally h</p>
<p>lived in large groups only when fishing was plentiful in the summer. Prior to 194</p>
<p>the majority of the [[Cree]] lived in the bush and village settlements were not inhabit</p>
<p>year-round except by a small minority (Salisbury, [[1986]]). After [[1947]], howeve</p>
<p>more and more [[Cree]] settled into village life. Nevertheless, by [[1971]], still more th</p>
<p>half resided primarily in the bush, although many had accommodations in the</p>
<p>lage as a secondary residence. Most tallymen continued to primarily reside in t
bush.</p>
<p>There is some debate over the in[[flu]]ence of the fur [[trade]] on the [[Cree]] system of</p>
<p>land management (see [[Bishop]] &amp; Morantz, [[1986]]). The word tallyman is English for
the [[Cree]] word amiskuchimaaw, which can be translated as Beaver Boss or steward.
The tallymen's name is related to [[HBC]] requirements from the [[1930]]s and [[1940]]s that</p>
<p>a bush leader "tally" (count) beaver houses within his hunting area. During the
[[1930]]s, a system of "Beaver Preserves" was institutionalized by [[Western]] organiza
tions such as the [[HBC]] and the provincial [[government]]. Under the Beaver Preserve
system, these tallies were then used to assign annual trapping quotas back to the tal</p>
<p>lyman (who distributed them across his hunting group). The tallyman's job was
also to ensure that the quotas were met but not exceeded.
The Beaver Preserve system appears to have been built on a preexisting indige</p>
<p>nous framework (Feit, [[1995]]). Berkes ([[1995]]) demonstrates that the management
practices of the tallyman could not have arisen from a [[Western]] worldview. Al
though the English designation may come from the [[HBC]], the form of management</p>
<p>is not a White invention (Berkes, [[1995]]). Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives ([[1947]])
confirm this:
Our organization [of beaver preserves] is based on [[Indian]] tradition and custom, it
meets with approval among the limited number of [[Indian]]s to whom we have been
able to brings its benefits. The main reason for their appreciation is that once the</p>
<p>White man's practices of written leases and agreements are disposed of we revert</p>
<p>to [[Indian]] custom, pattern our organization after their sound, well-established
practice and divide our preserves according to the [[aboriginal]] plan of land tenure</p>
<p>that from time immemorial has served the [[Indian]] population, (p. 689)</p>
<p>That is, although the Hudson's [[Bay]] managers "appointed" a tallyman, this person
was usually a recognized leader in an [[indigenous]] system of trapline management.</p>
<p>The appointed person, now formally called a tallyman for Hudson's [[Bay]]'s pur
poses, was a senior, experienced hunter who was already in charge of his family</p>
<p>hunting ground—a role he continued to enact despite the overlay of the [[HBC]]
designation.</p>

<p>Although the development of the fur [[trade]] meant that the [[Cree]] operated und</p>
<p>dual form of economy (i.e., subsistence and market economies), it did not s</p>
<p>[[Cree]] culture away from a reliance on subsistence activities or from their beliefs</p>
<p>practices:
The [[Indian]]s [[[Cree]]] still brought in as many pelts as they wanted, not the number</p>
<p>the [[company]] would have liked. [[Europe]]an technology continued to be used, but</p>
<p>hunting was still (as it is even today) based on age-old methods The political,
social, and religious life of the James [[Bay]] people continued outside the direct
in[[flu]]ence of the [[Europe]]ans, though it was not unaffected by occurrences in the</p>
<p>economic sphere. (Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]], p. 170)
Tanner ( [[1979]]) also confirms that the traditional beliefs tended to guide all activities
that occurred in the bush, including those related to the fur [[trade]]. In contrast, the</p>
<p>Christian missionaries who arrived at the trading posts in the 19th-century (Feit,</p>
<p>[[1995]]; Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]]) actively attempted to change [[Cree]] ideology by
positioning [[Cree]] beliefs as "witchcraft."
However, the [[Indian]] Act institutionally changed [[Cree]] leadership structures. The
[[Indian]] Act of [[1947]] was problematic, in part, because "this distribution of authority</p>
<p>did not reflect [[Cree]] political culture" (Feit, [[1985]], p. 35). Historically, a chief was
the leader who oversaw the "summer settlement" but did not oversee the band
throughout the rest of the year. Although the chief was granted certain powers and</p>
<p>responsibilities, it was a role that dispersed with the hunters when they separated</p>
<p>into smaller hunting groups, "micro-bands" (Salisbury, [[1986]]), in the fall. At this</p>
<p>point in time, the hunting group leader (later to be called the tallyman) was in
charge most of the year, with the chief exercising in[[flu]]ence over a shorter time
period and only over the summer settlement.7 After the [[Indian]] Act, which required</p>
<p>a permanent year-round chief and band council, the leadership structure began to
change, with the chiefs and council receiving more authority.</p>
<p>The leadership role of the chief has changed significantly over time. In the
[[1980]]s, Salisbury ([[1986]]) notes that [[Cree]] chiefs and band managers tended to be
younger, more educated, and English-speaking, in comparison with the more
senior hunting group leaders, who typically spoke only [[Cree]] (this has changed over
time with many tallymen now speaking English and [[Cree]]). In most cases, the chiefs</p>
<p>were respected community members. They were competent at dealing with exter
nal, "White" institutions and organizations and were valued as community leaders.
Although the tallymen had the opportunity to become more involved in community
affairs through the council, their inability to speak English resulted in little ongoing</p>
<p>involvement (Salisbury, [[1986]]).
With increased pressure from economic development, the role of the chief
intensified. Finally, during the James [[Bay]] negotiations, it was the young, English</p>
<p>speaking chiefs (the new administrative elite) who rallied together and suc
cessfully led the fight against unapproved hydroelectric development by Hydro
[[Québec]]. Their leadership role at this time continued to reflect the [[Cree]] respect for</p>
<p>competence—these leaders were extremely competent at negotiating with the
White world. During this time, these young leaders also sought the advice of older</p>
<p>hunters who were competent in the traditional ways (e.g., the tallymen) (Feit,
[[1985]]). For the first time, a [[Cree]] regional council was born: the Grand Council of the
[[Cree]].</p>
<p>When the [[Cree]] discovered that the James [[Bay]] Project was going to be built on
their land, they banded together with the Inuit and launched a large legal and public</p>

<p>relations [[battle]] against Hydro-[[Québec]]. The [[Cree]] and Inuit were partially success
ful in their fight against economic development—in a joint legal action, the native</p>
<p>peoples in the region brought [[Canada]], [[Québec]], and Hydro-[[Québec]] to the bargain
ing table. Land claim rights were subsequently recognized in the James [[Bay]] and</p>
<p>[[North]]ern [[Québec]] Agreement (JBNQA, [[1976]]) and a large compensation package
was provided. However, these efforts also were unsuccessful in that development</p>
<p>continued to proceed and became institutionalized in a legal agreement that the
[[Cree]] have often viewed as questionable (Grand Council of the [[Cree]]s, of [[Québec]],
GCCQ, [[1995]]). According to the GCCQ ([[1995]]), "It is the firm view of the [[Cree]]s that</p>
<p>the Agreement was negotiated in [[1974]]-75 under circumstances that were clearly
inequitable, highly pressured and, in a number of key respects, unconscionable"</p>
<p>(p. 252).
Billy Diamond, first Grand Chief who negotiated the agreement, explained the</p>
<p>negotiation process in the following way:
Our feeling was that no one can buy a way of life and culture with money... but we</p>
<p>saw the need to limit the damages, seek remedial works and have certain funda
[[mental]] rights recognized. We decided to attempt to negotiate a settlement. We
really had no other choice.... [[Canada]] made it clear that if we [the [[Cree]]] did not</p>
<p>proceed with the agreement process, unilateral legislation would have been
imposed on us in any case. (Diamond, [[1990]], cited in GCCQ, [[1995]], pp. 252- 253)</p>
<p>After the JBNQA was signed, [[Cree]] regional organizational structures became
legally institutionalized with the GCCQ, the [[Cree]] Regional Authority (CRA), and</p>
<p>the [[Cree]] Trappers' Association (CTA), among others. In addition to the Grand
Chief, the Grand Council includes the chief and another leader from each com
munity who sit on the Board of Directors, as well as an executive group made up
of four regional leaders (Feit, [[1995]]). After the settlement, each village became rec</p>
<p>ognized as a municipality (Salisbury, [[1986]]) and became the permanent home to
many of the [[Cree]]. The chief and community life became a dominant reality. How</p>
<p>ever, for the people who lived in the bush (in some villages, a sizeable minority),
the traditional system of trapline management (with the tallyman as the leader),
continued.</p>
<p>Environ[[mental]] impacts of the James [[Bay]] Project were significant. All told, at
the end of James [[Bay]] I, five hydroelectric reservoirs covered more than 11,000</p>
<p>square kilometers, the seasonal flow pattern of the LaGrande River had been
reversed (and the estuary changed from saltwater to fresh), large dead zones had</p>
<p>been created around each reservoir with a significant loss of wetlands and in
creased soil erosion, animal migration routes had been affected (including the
drowning of 10,000 caribou in [[September]] [[1994]]), and a serious increase in methyl
mercury levels in fish and human populations (Berkes, [[1990]]). The mighty rivers of</p>
<p>Eastmain, LaGrande, and the Opinaca were changed drastically. For example, the</p>
<p>Eastmain river was diverted with 90% of its natural flow disappearing (Messier
et al., [[1987]], cited in Berkes, [[1990]]) into the production of hydroelectricity.

<p>Yet Salisbury ([[1986]]) argues that the [[Cree]] were able to positively control much</p>
<p>of their social evolution following the James [[Bay]] Project and the JBNQA. Specifi
cally, he notes improvements in cultural unity, transportation access, communica
tion networks, housing, education, access to the wage economy, and the increased</p>
<p>consumption of goods (e.g., snowmobiles, chainsaws, TVs, radio, clothing, etc.).
With a multi-million-dollar compensation package, the [[Cree]] were called (by some)</p>
<p>"the Arabs of the [[North]]" (MacGregor, [[1989]], p. 70).
Another positive outcome of the JBNQA was the implementation of the Income</p>
<p>Security Program (ISP), whereby the provincial [[Québec]] [[government]] provides
basic income to [[Cree]] families following a traditional lifestyle.8 This program has
been quite successful and the [[Cree]] Regional Authority suggests that more people</p>
<p>are now pursuing traditional pursuits (hunting, trapping, and fishing), following
the implementation of the ISP (W. Iserhoff, personal communication, [[1997]]). Salis
bury ([[1986]]) confirms this: By [[1981]], the traditional activity of hunting was more
important in [[Cree]] villages than a decade earlier, primarily due to the success of the</p>
<p>ISP in making subsistence hunting an economically viable occupation. In addition,
in a detailed evaluation of the ISP, Scott and Feit ([[1992]]) conclude that the program
responds well to the needs of [[Cree]] harvesters. However, the authors note that the</p>
<p>ISP cannot guarantee the maintenance of hunting life; in addition, the [[Cree]] must
maintain their traditional physical relationship with the land.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Niezen ([[1993]]) has highlighted other negative sociocultural im
pacts. Following hydroelectric development, there was a rapid movement toward
permanent village residency. This swift cultural and geographic shift resulted in
high frequencies of suicide, neglect of [[child]]ren, vandalism, and drug and alcohol</p>
<p>abuse (Niezen, [[1993]]). He also suggests that this centralization has "decreased the
proportion of people in the traditional economy—a situation which has led to
social instability in the villages" (p. 510). Infrastructure developments, such as the
road network, also increased the availability of [[drugs]] and alcohol. In addition, cen
tralization may have increased the need for a cash economy, as motorized transpor</p>
<p>tation became a necessary part of bush life (see Wenzel, [[1991]], for a discussion of
the same point with respect to the Inuit).</p>
<p>During the construction of the James [[Bay]] Project, two main permanent roads
were built along with numerous temporary (winter) roads (Salisbury, [[1986]]). "By
[[1981]]a major road traversed [[Cree]] territory, and all settlements were negotiating for
their connection to a road to the outside" (Salisbury, [[1986]], p. 5). By [[1999]], all but</p>
<p>two [[Cree]] communities had a permanent road (excluding Waskaganish and Whap
magoostui). A main highway connecting Nemaska to Chibougamau—the Route
du Nord—also had been completed in the early [[1990]]s. While undoubtedly bring
ing the [[Cree]] numerous benefits (e.g., more convenient and cheaper transporta
tion), the road system also opened the territory up to additional development such</p>
<p>as [[mining]], forestry, and sports hunting and fishing, which brought additional
environ[[mental]] degradation (e.g., clear-cutting, pollution, illegal hunting, etc.).
McCutcheon ( [[1991]] ) also notes that the improved road access brought problems for</p>
<p>the tallymen because uncontrolled trapping started to occur in areas adjacent to
roads.</p>
<p>Hydro-[[Québec]] [[research]]ers present a more positive picture in their summary of
the [[research]] on the impact of hydroelectric development 15 years after the project</p>
<p>became operational (Guertin, Demers, &amp; [[Peru]]sse, [[1993]]). This report, however,
focuses on biophysical [[research]] on the environment (predominately with support
ive [[research]] results). The authors admit that for "various reasons" (not provided),</p>

<p>Whiteman/ CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 433</p>
<p>the follow-up studies on the sociocultural impacts were not as systematic as f</p>
<p>more biophysical impacts. While acknowledging that the LaGrande comp</p>
<p>affected four out of eight villages, and that some traplines were flooded, they
clude that "the evolution of the number of beneficiaries of the income securit</p>
<p>programme for [[Cree]] hunters and trappers in the most affected communities is s</p>
<p>lar to unaffected communities" (p. 405). This implies a marginal sociocultur</p>
<p>impact. They also emphasize the success of the ISP in promoting, in effect pre</p>
<p>ing, "a lifestyle which seemed condemned" (p. 406) and highlight the region</p>
<p>[[Cree]] infrastructure as a positive outcome of both the Agreement and hydroelectr</p>
<p>development.
Furthermore, these authors focus exclusively on the positive benefits of the road</p>
<p>network for the [[Cree]], that is, the decrease in the prices of products; increased eco</p>
<p>nomic and cultural exchanges with other [[Cree]] communities and the south; easier
hunting, fishing, and trapping; and improved, more convenient access to remote
traplines. Negative impacts, such as uncontrolled access (a precursor to the "trag
edy of the commons," see Hardin, [[1968]]), are not identified. Even the increase in
recreational hunting and fishing by non-[[Native]]s is also viewed as a positive change</p>
<p>that creates only limited and localized competition with [[Cree]] pursuits.</p>
<p>The only negative sociocultural effect identified in this corporate study is a
decrease in employment in the [[1980]]s (and its related social problems) following
"diminished growth in the tertiary sector and construction activities resulting from</p>
<p>the implementation of the agreement" (p. 406). Not surprisingly, the solution
offered by the Hydro-[[Québec]] [[research]]ers is that "new avenues of development</p>
<p>must be opened up" (pp. 406-407). Thus, the implicit message is that the
sociocultural effects of development have been positive; the only negative effects</p>
<p>(i.e., unemployment) result when development activities are diminished. The pos
sible impacts on [[Cree]] tallymen are never [[research]]ed and therefore mitigation plans</p>
<p>are not identified or addressed. The authors conclude that the James [[Bay]] Project is</p>
<p>a project "in accord with its environment" (p. 387).</p>
<p>In another impact assessment, the same imbalance appears. In "The
Chibougamau-Nemiscau Road: Environ[[mental]] and Social Impact Assessment
Summary" ([[Cree]] Construction &amp; Ministere des Transports, Gouvernement du
[[Québec]], [[1990]]), there is again no recognition of the negative sociocultural impacts</p>
<p>(particularly on the role of the tallyman) of the proposed permanent highway.
Whereas "active native campsites" are identified as features of "very high resis
tance" to the road, there is no discussion of how the tallymen and other trappers
(who live on and use these campsites) will be affected by a permanent road. Conse
quently, there is no need for mitigating action.</p>
<p>In summary, previous [[research]] on the sociocultural impacts of development
tends to treat the [[Cree]] as one large homogeneous group and does not adequately</p>
<p>investigate impacts on [[Cree]] tallymen despite their cultural significance and sus
tainable approach to management.
RESEARCH METHOD</p>
<p>When I first arrived in James [[Bay]], I originally began to study the impac</p>
<p>hydroelectric development on the [[Cree]] people. More specifically, I hoped to</p>
<p>ine the human experience of living next to one of the world's largest hydroelec</p>
<p>dams, the James [[Bay]] Project. This was my "foreshadowed" [[research]] questi</p>
<p>(Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, [[1995]]). After my fieldwork began, I realized that d</p>

<p>434 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / [[December]] [[2004]]</p>
<p>sions about development inevitably broadened. By [[1995]], economic development
of the region had expanded into [[mining]], forestry, tourism, as well as hydro-power.</p>
<p>These activities seemed to have cumulative and interrelated effects on both the
[[Cree]] culture and the natural environment, at least from the perspective of the [[Cree]].</p>
<p>Anthropological [[research]] confirmed that [[Cree]] elders viewed the James [[Bay]]
Project as just one example of an ongoing relationship with "White men" (Feit,
[[1985]]). In addition, discussions about the impact of development tended to be
framed against the "way it used to be," that is, the way the land was traditionally</p>
<p>managed. In time, it dawned on me that I had no real conceptualization of this tra</p>
<p>ditional management approach and that perhaps this was a critical [[research]] ques
tion in itself. Eventually, I refocused my Ph.D. dissertation on a description of the</p>
<p>traditional ecologically embedded management practices of the [[Cree]] tallymen
(Whiteman, [[1999]]; Whiteman &amp; Cooper, [[2000]]).
However, the impacts of development remained an important [[research]] issue
during my fieldwork. This article presents my ethnographic findings on this topic,</p>
<p>specifically from the perspective of [[Cree]] tallymen.9 It is based on 18 months of</p>
<p>ethnographic fieldwork over a 2-year period, including a 10-week apprentice
ship to a well-respected tallyman, Freddy Jolly, who acted as my key informant in</p>
<p>this study. Data were collected through participant observation and in-depth
ethnographic interviews (Hammersley &amp; Atkinson, [[1995]]).
In addition to participant observation, I undertook a series of in-depth inter
views (Fontana &amp; Frey, [[1994]]) with [[Cree]] trappers, elders, tallymen, and key mem
bers of the local band councils, the CTA, and the [[Cree]] Regional Authority. In total,</p>
<p>I conducted 31 interviews. Most interviews were in English but some were in [[Cree]],
with translation provided by my key informant. My key informant, Freddy Jolly,</p>
<p>requested that his real name be used, as has occurred in other anthropological work</p>
<p>with the [[Cree]] (e.g., Preston, [[1982]]). Others are quoted anonymously. This article
also relies on document analysis of Web sites and key documents such as the James</p>
<p>[[Bay]] and [[North]]ern [[Québec]] Agreement (JBNQA), among others.
Data analysis was iterative. Rough, broad categorization occurred during my
fieldwork and was refined by further data collection. Emergent themes and dimen</p>
<p>sions were identified through the continual review of notes, interview data, field</p>
<p>journal entries, and comparison with other [[research]]. Detailed coding work was
done outside the field site with the qualitative data analysis software program QSR</p>
<p>NU<em>DIST (Nonnumerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theoriz
ing). Specifically, all interview data were transcribed and coded using NU</em>DIST.
Handwritten field notes were not transcribed but were coded by hand with the same</p>
<p>coding system. Data analysis also relied on ongoing respondent validation by a
variety of [[Cree]] participants, including Freddy Jolly (Hammersley &amp; Atkinson,</p>
<p>[[1995]]).
RESEARCH FINDINGS</p>
<p>Tallymen Talking: "On The Impact of Development"</p>
<p>My field [[research]] suggests that cumulative economic development throug</p>
<p>the past 30 years has a direct and far-reaching impact on [[Cree]] tallymen. Find</p>
<p>suggest that economic development in the region has resulted in tallymen l</p>
<p>control over resources and management decisions. Furthermore, forestry, mi</p>
<p>and hydroelectric development have resulted in a significant loss of natur</p>

<p>sources and environ[[mental]] degradation and have negatively affected the tally
men's ability to manage. This appeared to have resulted in a gradual lessening of</p>
<p>respect for this traditional role among community members. These impacts, in
turn, had a strong emotional impact on individual tallymen and to some degree
have caused a schism within [[Cree]] culture.
Before presenting emergent themes from my data, I first present an extended</p>
<p>excerpt of an interview I conducted with a well-respected [[Cree]] elder and tally
man, who offers an emotional and [[representative]] perspective on the impact of
development.
A Tallyman Talks
I'm going to tell about what they're doing to my land now. How the Whiteman
enters our land. Before, in the olden days, there was no Whiteman. It was like the</p>
<p>stories I've told you about. Now ... if you look at my land, our trapline is a huge
size. There were a lot of trees during the time of my story. All kinds of trees, dif</p>
<p>ferent kinds of trees, huge tall trees. Now if you look at my land, it's all flat—
clear-cutting. Even the mountains.
Before they cut the trees we had a meeting with the forestry [[company]] and told</p>
<p>them about places not to cut—the moose yards. There's one place that moose used
to hang around, where we used to get our food. That's the main part. That's the part</p>
<p>we didn't want to be clear-cut. They didn't even listen to us. They cut all the trees
and took them. All over the place. There was a favourite spot for hunting and there</p>
<p>were huge mountains but now they're gone. It's all clear-cut. There's only one
small part and that's the only place we can go for moose hunting, that's the last
part where it's not clear-cut.</p>
<p>The other places that are clear-cut we cannot get anything, not even a moose.
Where they were clear-cutting and destroying the ground, taking even what the
beaver eats [the branches]. The mess they make, they pollute the water, the lakes.</p>
<p>It affects the beaver. The lakes are dirty. The damage they do, and the roads, it</p>
<p>affects the animals. Even fish. There's a spot where we used to go fishing. It's
really different now. When the lakes are polluted, it goes through the rivers and
streams. The fish are different. It affects them through the water, everything goes</p>
<p>into the lakes. The beaver too. The beaver moves away, moves out to where it's not
affected.</p>
<p>I'm the tallyman of my trapline. They don't listen to me even though I tell
them What does Wahmschtickoosh [the White man] mean when he says that
[the earth is not alive]? The earth is living. And still today, God is giving us life to
live.</p>
<p>There's one more thing that I want to say to her [the [[research]]er]. Not to believe</p>
<p>in what they [the Whitemen] teach you. Believe in what I believe. ([[Cree]] elder and</p>
<p>tallyman, personal communication, [[March]] 29, [[1997]], Mistassini, James [[Bay]])</p>
<p>Although each tallyman's story remains unique, there were a number of com
mon themes that emerged from my [[research]]. These are presented in more detail</p>
<p>below, followed by a discussion.
Loss of Control
The tallymen interviewed felt that a key impact of economic development has</p>
<p>been a shift in traditional power and a loss of control over natural resource use.
Document analysis and interviews suggest that as a result of the JBNQA, the tally</p>
<p>man's management and leadership function is shared with, and often eclipsed by,</p>

<p>436 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / [[December]] [[2004]]</p>
<p>the [[Cree]] regional and community leaders as well as with [[government]] and corp
decision makers.</p>
<p>Under the JBNQA, the provincial [[government]] of [[Québec]] has the right to</p>
<p>eral and forestry development in Category 2 and Category 3 land (the [[Cree]] re</p>
<p>full rights to Category 1 land, which is the site of the villages and band cou
Yet, the majority of [[Cree]] traplines are located in Category 2 and 3 designated</p>
<p>and each of these is managed by a tallyman. Although the JBNQA may hav</p>
<p>brought about greater regional unity, tallymen felt that it also brought a disrup</p>
<p>and splintering of local control over local resources. Previously, tallymen had
cultural right to make decisions about natural resource management on their</p>
<p>traplines. The JBNQA legally shifted authority from the tallymen toward the c</p>
<p>and Grand Chief, and formal negotiations for natural resource developmen</p>
<p>required consultation with the Grand Council of the [[Cree]]s and local chiefs bu</p>
<p>not require local negotiations with specific tallymen even when their trapl
would bear the brunt of the impacts.</p>
<p>A tallyman summarized this position as follows:
Both in the [[Cree]] society and in non-[[Native]] society, I would say that. Yes. In the
past, you know when a tallyman had... he had a piece of land and the tallyman had</p>
<p>the sole responsibility. He had authority over that land. He was able to determine</p>
<p>which people can go there and which places they can go. He can put also, you
know, a limit of what game can be [[kill]]ed. And today, that's almost impossible
because so much development has been focused on the north. You know? No mat
ter what the tallyman tries to do, somehow nobody seems to listen to them and
they just go ahead anyway.</p>
<p>Freddy Jolly, my key informant, stated similar concerns publicly in a letter to</p>
<p>[[Cree]] magazine The Nation ([[1997]]):
There has been a lot of destruction on our lands. Forestry, [[mining]], roads, the hydro</p>
<p>projects and more, these have all changed our lands and our way of life. As a [[Cree]],
I have cried when they destroyed our lands. As a tallyman, I have tried in so many
ways to stop this but nothing has worked. The development and abuse of our lands</p>
<p>continues, and the tallyman no longer has the power to save his trapline.</p>
<p>Interview data indicated that this concern was widespread among tallymen.</p>
<p>The road infrastructure, built to support economic development, had als</p>
<p>sulted in a loss of control. A past chief of Mistassini provided the following gene</p>
<p>perspective:
Even though the tallyman are there, they give orders, they try the best way they
can, whatever authority was handed down to them to look after that land, they're</p>
<p>trying their best to control it. But because of access roads, and you know, ski</p>
<p>doos—now you can have skidoos leave here and head down at 200 miles [per
hour] and no problem, they can... they're so economical. And you know, they're
all over the place. Nobody car: control them anymore.</p>
<p>Interviews with tallymen along the Route du Nord confirmed that the road (w</p>
<p>convenient) had opened their traplines to outsiders. Although an environmen</p>
<p>and social impact assessment of the Route du Nord was undertaken, docume</p>

<p>Whiteman/CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 437</p>
<p>analysis indicated that it did not identify any possible cultural impacts on the tally</p>
<p>men. Yet my field [[research]] indicates that the road infrastructure had directly</p>
<p>affected the tallymen. A tallyman explained his concern, "These days, you've got</p>
<p>access mainly by roads, helicopters, planes, you name it. How is a tallyman able to
control all this?"
On the positive side, in an interview with a member of the CTA, the suggestion</p>
<p>was made that the introduction of the ISP allowed tallymen to maintain some</p>
<p>economic clout because tallymen have control over who lives on the trapline, and
therefore, the tallymen indirectly have control over who receives Income Security.
But tallymen who were interviewed in my study did not raise this as a key benefit.</p>
<p>Loss of Resources
Participant observation and interview data indicated that the loss of natural
resources was a community-wide problem for the [[Cree]] Nation. As one tallyman</p>
<p>explained,
They [the development [[companies]]] don 't even think about Eenou, how they live in
the bush. They destroy all the things that Eenou has. How will they survive in the</p>
<p>bush when they destroy the land, the animals? They're destroying our money in
our [[Cree]] bank in the bush.</p>
<p>Other tallymen agreed that development has brought change to the environment:
Before. Well before for sure it was different from today, that's for sure. Wherever</p>
<p>we went before we were able to notice game quite regularly, wherever we went. At</p>
<p>that time there was no disturbance. Because we were able to leave our hunting ter
ritory in the spring time when we finished hunting and while we were away there</p>
<p>was no disturbance in the territory and when we come back in the fall there's...
because there was no disturbance of any sort, animals roamed around freely and</p>
<p>came near the territories where we were hunting before. That's not possible or
hardly possible nowadays because there's the access road here through the trans
mission line, there's Route du Nord, there's transmission lines ... practically all
the transmission lines except for one right at the end which misses my trapline.
Today, the biggest problems are forestry and [[mining]]. The [[mining]] I say will be a</p>
<p>big problem because I can see the damage it causes. They won't be able to eat the
fish because of the pollution it's going to face.
Before there were any roads, it was different. It was good hunting. Even there
were lots of birds, geese, ducks, partridge. In some of the areas of the river where
there is shallow water, you would see a lot of ducks in the water before there were
any roads— Just walking along the shores of the river, I [[kill]]ed 46 geese one time.
Where the good spots were, where we used to stay, now they're not there. The spot
is not very far from the road. It's the road that affects this. It erases off everything.</p>
<p>Where the road is, everything has been erased.</p>
<p>Interview data indicated that tallymen were seriously worried about environ[[mental]]</p>
<p>impacts of roads clear-cutting, [[mining]], and the impact of illegal hunting and fish
ing. Tallymen whose trapline had been affected by hydroelectric development also</p>
<p>were concerned about these environ[[mental]] impacts. Tallymen also noted that
sports hunting (particularly illegal) brought additional pressure on the natural</p>
<p>environment.</p>

<p>438 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / [[December]] [[2004]]</p>
<p>Loss of a Management Approach?</p>
<p>When natural resources were changed significantly through economic de
opment, tallymen felt that their ability to practice traditional management</p>
<p>directly affected—their place of work was destroyed or harmed, as was their ab</p>
<p>to teach younger generations. In the face of environ[[mental]] degradation from</p>
<p>nomic development, Freddy lamented, "They're destroying our classroom!"</p>
<p>similarly, in the wake of a proposed hydro-expansion, Freddy said, "[My trap</p>
<p>will be flooded. All my tools will be under the water." Tools, in this case, bei</p>
<p>housed in the land itself. In many cases, tallymen felt that financial compe</p>
<p>tion could not simply mitigate such impacts. "No wonder we want to keep our</p>
<p>and love our land," an important [[Cree]] elder and tallyman said, "That's how
survive—from the land."</p>
<p>Economic development and the JBNQA also appeared to have affected the
tallymen's "walking outside" approach to management, which my earlier [[research]]
has found to be key to their sustainable management approach. According to a past</p>
<p>chief and tallyman,
Before the signing [of the JBNQA], the trappers, the hunters that harvested out
there on the land, stayed out there on the land. They walked. They canoed. They
did everything with their own physical bodies. And since the signing of the Agree</p>
<p>ment, there's all kinds of subsidies that came out, financial subsidies for gas and
ground transportation, air transportation. And since then, a lot of the trappers and
the hunters that used to go out there started to, you know, be overweight. We have</p>
<p>problems with diabetes.</p>
<p>While Freddy powerfully talked about how his management knowledge came
from "walking," he recognized that he no longer practiced this as fully as he had in
the past. At the same time, Freddy felt that the TEK from the elders was so powerful</p>
<p>because it stemmed directly from this approach: "So whatever the elders say, it</p>
<p>comes true. Because like I said, they have seen this. They have walked on this
land—it's called James [[Bay]] territory."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, participant observation and interviews indicated that tallymen
still spent a great amount of time out on the land "touring" and extensively travers</p>
<p>ing their local ecosystem, more so than most other [[Cree]] community and band
council members.
Like me, as a tallyman I travel. I travel all over my trapline in winter and in the
summer and in the fall and in the spring. Cause I know. I see. I have five senses. My</p>
<p>trapline is like an office to me... we never get books, reading the books about ani</p>
<p>mals, all we see is in our land. The tracks of the animals, that's our book.</p>
<p>Loss of Respect
The loss of natural resources, combined with a significantly reduced control
over the remaining resources, appears to have led to a loss of cultural respect for the</p>
<p>tallyman. The following quote presents this impact and it was confirmed by many
others:
Even with our own people, it's the same thing. Today, I see ... it's just a title. It's
just a title. It doesn't have the authority or the respect it had at one time. Although
I'm hoping that by talking about it, and by bringing it to the attention of a lot of</p>

<p>Whiteman / CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 439</p>
<p>people, which I do a lot of the time, that eventually there will be a recognition
again at a very high level that yes, if anything needs to be done to that land it has to</p>
<p>go through the tallyman. Because it's the tallyman that looks after that land.</p>
<p>Loss of cultural respect in turn further impedes the tallyman's ability to control</p>
<p>access to resources. A past chief discussed the relationship between control,
respect, and economic development:
I'm going to... point my finger at the signing of the James [[Bay]] and [[North]]ern Qué</p>
<p>bec Agreement. Because ever since then... before signing the Agreement, the tal</p>
<p>lymen were, had a... they had authority. They... they knew how to traverse the
land. They knew all of... the whole territory. And they knew just exactly how
many people they can allow to come in and hunt on their territory without damag
ing or impacting whatever animals that were in that territory. So, they had control,
complete control over that territory in terms of harvesting, nurturing, and looking</p>
<p>after the land basically and promoting respect for that land. And then the Agree</p>
<p>ment was signed and you know people had money... And basically, the authority
of the tallyman started dwindling to the extent that... I think that it would be fair
to say that we're starting to lose respect for the tallyman... within the [[Cree]] culture
as well. It's not a fair statement to make but it's a fact.</p>
<p>Emotional and Spiritual Loss
Although the loss of resources affects all [[Cree]], my data suggest that the impact
was magnified for the tallymen who saw themselves as the traditional caretakers of</p>
<p>the land. Without an exception, the [[Cree]] tallymen in my study voiced a strong per</p>
<p>sonal identification with their land. Freddy summarized this perspective, "When
you live in the bush all year long, watching over it, the land speaks to you. So when</p>
<p>the tallymen speak, it is the land speaking."</p>
<p>Tallymen perceived the local ecology as a place of work and a place of rest:
"There's healing in the mind in the bush." Environ[[mental]] degradation thus affected</p>
<p>both their work and their sanctuary. A loss or degradation of resources was per
ceived to be a highly emotional and traumatic event. For example, a tallyman from</p>
<p>Nemaska explained, "[Development] weakened the trapper. He doesn't have the
full strength to go on.... It's like you wounded the man when he sees his land, all
chopped. It's like the tallyman doesn't have any rights." Similar to many tallymen,
Freddy argued that if economic development continued, "There will be a lot of</p>
<p>wounded hunters looking back at where they used to live, what they used to do—
hunt, fish, trap."</p>
<p>According to one tallyman, there was an urgent need to
bring out something to awaken the chiefs to what the tallyman is facing in the
bush. The hurts. I'm sure the tallymen are hurt a lot but they [the chiefs] don't
seem to understand the hurt they're facing because their heart isn't in the bush.</p>
<p>There's a trapper that told me that he has got nothing and they're chopping the
trees in his trapline. The chief said he was negotiating but he hasn't got anything.</p>
<p>It's just words. You have to act upon your faith.</p>

<p>raised,
the hills and mountains will be turned into islands.
He will look back to the rivers and lakes where he used to set
his traps and fish nets,
as a wounded hunter.</p>
<p>A wounded hunter will have no more the sound of rapids or
the sound of the ice breaking as it floats down the river.</p>
<p>He'll now look back to his land where he had a good time
hunting and fishing, as a wounded hunter.</p>
<p>Looking back to his land where his joy was.
Looking back to his land where he used to walk.
Looking back, watching his family laughing while roasting
beaver.</p>
<p>A wounded hunter will only have the tears of his past,
a wounded hunter's mind will be different,</p>
<p>he'll be wandering around to a strange land,
a land that is flooded.
A hunter who has been wounded will be wounded the rest
of his life,</p>
<p>until he passes away.
—Freddy Jolly, [[Cree]] Tallyman ([[1992]]; first appeared in the
Grand Council/[[Cree]] Regional Authority report on the</p>
<p>environ[[mental]], economic, and social impacts of James [[Bay]] II)</p>
<p>A Schism Within [[Cree]] Culture</p>
<p>My data suggested that the ongoing economic development has created internal
division within [[Cree]] culture. Document analysis of the JBNQA indicated that the
importance of the "formalized" chiefs (and Grand Chief) as negotiators has shifted</p>
<p>spheres of responsibility and significantly affected the traditional leadership con
trol of the tallymen over natural resources. This was a source of great debate within</p>
<p>the [[Cree]] Nation during my fieldwork. This shift in decision-making authority
caused difficulties. As a past Grand Youth Chief explained,
Before there was a fight between the [[Cree]] and the [[government]]. Now there's a fight</p>
<p>between the [[Cree]], the [[government]], and the [[Cree]] amongst themselves. So the peo</p>
<p>ple who will win—I don't know who but somebody's going to win. And I feel it
will be the people who want to bring back the role of the tallyman, have ît recog</p>
<p>nized and bring back the laws of the trapline.</p>
<p>A number of tallymen elaborated extensively on this. For instance, according to
Freddy Jolly,
It's different [now]. Like in the olden days, they [the chiefs and tallymen] re
spected each other. They listened to each other. The tallyman. But now, since they</p>
<p>signed the Agreement, there's only the Chiefs. The Chiefs want to control the
land. The [[Cree]] land. But like I said, there's 291 traplines, 325 tallymen. When
they signed the [JBNQA] Agreement, they forgot about the tallyman. 'Cause us,</p>
<p>as a tallyman, we watch over our land, like trapline R-21, on my side. So, that's
how the tallyman is. We watch over. Even when the [[government]] comes and have</p>
<p>contracts over here or flooding or building the roads or... clear-cutting— When</p>

<p>Whiteman / CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 441</p>
<p>the [[government]] wants to do something, it goes to the Grand Council of the [[Cree]]s,
like Board of Directors, the chiefs, all the chiefs in nine communities, and even the
counselors, but they forgot about the tallyman. But now, like what they're doing,
it's us, the tallyman, the trappers in our trapline, we're the ones that are affected.</p>
<p>We're the ones who's suppose to decide whatever the [[government]] wants to do up
here, up north, 'cause we know our traplines. We walk on our traplines all winter.
We hunt. We fish. We trap. So, it's very hard for them to decide 'cause they only sit
in the office.</p>
<p>That's why I say, whenever they want to do something up north, first they
should talk to the tallymen and their families. They are the ones... they should go
to first before any chiefs decide or counselors decide or even people in Category 1.</p>
<p>'Cause we are in Category 3. When they signed the Agreement, they call it Cate
gory 3 but for me and my family we call it Category 1. That's the [[Cree]] land, James
[[Bay]] territory. Cause when they signed the Agreement, like I said, they make their</p>
<p>decisions right inside Category 1 [in the village and band council]. But I want it
differently. I want the tallymen to be there. All the tallymen to be there whenever
the contracts, or whenever something's going to come up, or a mine. It's us, the tal</p>
<p>lymen and the trappers, the full-time trappers, it's us—we have to decide if we
want this mine or forestry or road to be built, or NBR, or whatever Hydro-[[Québec]]
wants to do up north. It's us, the trappers, the tallymen who should sit on meetings</p>
<p>and talk about this. And that would be equal. And that would be collective, collec</p>
<p>tive voices. But... when they signed the Agreement, and the chiefs want to con
trol the land, they don't see all the Land. They only see in the office and papers.
But us, the tallymen and the trappers, we know. We know our lands. On our lands,
on the ground, that's where we get our food. Under the water, that's where we get
our food.</p>
<p>Other tallymen also discussed this issue in detail. According to one tallyman,
I've always wondered to what extent do the chief and council have authority over
the land, when they talk about the land? Because if you look at the political level,
they look at the categories of land. You know, Category 1 lands under federal juris</p>
<p>diction and most of their funding for [[government]] services come from that. But</p>
<p>does it expand beyond that? You know? If there's development in my territory
does the chief have the right to say, "Yes, they can go ahead with that." Or... does</p>
<p>the tallyman? And I question that. And they say, "Well..." They always come
back to the "collective rights." Will this affect the rights of all the [[Cree]]s in the</p>
<p>James [[Bay]] area. No tallyman can go and make a decision or make an agreement
with a [[company]], you know, a development [[company]] unless if it's a consensus
reached by all the [[Cree]] communities I was there in a meeting where there were
a lot of other tallymen from other [[Cree]] communities and they were talking about</p>
<p>the building of the road, the Route du Nord. And I guess the Grand Chief was
there, the Chief, his Chief was there also, and they were all being pressured to
come up with a decision on the road. Of course [the tallyman] was opposing it.
And then of course, the last person ... you know, said, "So, should we go ahead
with this project? All in favour raise your hand."
That's the wrong system that's used in a lot of decision making within the</p>
<p>communities, that's a show of hands. [The tallyman] was saying, "You know, I
watched around and I see one guy look around and put his hand up. And the other
people started looking around and put their hand up." And he asked them, "You're</p>
<p>from Waswanipi. You have a trapline over there. Does it affect you, this road?
What gives you the right to decide what's happening on my territory?" And that
really hit me when he said that, and that's what's been happening a lot. Sometimes</p>
<p>it's the chiefs and the counselors of these communities that pressure other people
within the community to make a decision on somebody else's trapline or territory.</p>

<p>And that's why I was saying we have to get approval from the tallyman. They
know what their responsibilities are. They're not there to just go after money.
Unless they'd be rich by now!</p>
<p>Data indicated that the CTA did attempt to incorporate the tallymen's perspec</p>
<p>through a series of General Assembly meetings where the tallymen can give v</p>
<p>to concerns about trapline management. In addition, the local CTA committ
worked with the community band council and tallymen were able to approach</p>
<p>committee with concerns. However, this type of input was not perceived by</p>
<p>tallymen to be the same as their past decision-making authority and this was see</p>
<p>problematic.
According to a past chief,
Right now there is an organization in place, The [[Cree]] Trappers' Association. But,
basically, as far as I know, and a number of people I've talked to, they only look
after the interests of the trappers, the hunter. You know? And they don't single out
the tallyman and put him up here. And that's what they need to do. And if the [[Cree]]</p>
<p>Trappers' Association won't do that, then the tallymen themselves have to orga
nize themselves and do that. Because it's difficult right now I mean, I represent
[one of the villages] at the regional [[government]] but I don't know if individual tal</p>
<p>lymen accept me to speak on his behalf about what happens in his territory....
[The tallymen's] understanding is that "we're the tallymen and whatever happens</p>
<p>in our territory, our trapline, we should have a say in it. And the council, they
should just stay back and run the community."... Then again, the regional govern</p>
<p>ment, the Grand Council of the [[Cree]]s, have a mandate to protect the rights and
interests of the territory, so they come in and say, "Listen, you want to talk, discuss</p>
<p>development, you talk to us." So there's nothing in place that really clearly defines</p>
<p>who talks, who has authority over development.</p>
<p>In some cases, my fieldwork indicated that local band officials tried to act as a
bridge between development [[companies]] and tallymen. But this was not always
successful because the [[companies]] often did not act on the advice of the tallymen,
even when consulted. One tallyman explained,
One time a chief came to me and they were telling me to show [the forestry com</p>
<p>pany] the good spots where you have big trees. Then they gave me a map and I
drew circles where the big trees were. Then they asked me again, where are the
moose yards? Also, where do they go for the mating season? There's only two
things that they asked me about: the trees and the moose. Then they told me the</p>
<p>meeting is finished, and they went. But after, the moose hunters came in. And
then, the forestry [[company]] came in and cut down the trees.</p>
<p>In such cases, the local band ran the risk of appearing to represent the interests of</p>
<p>[[company]] officials rather than the tallymen. In part, this is because [[companies]] are
under no legal obligation to incorporate the tallyman's advice despite band efforts
to gain tallyman input.</p>
<p>Summary
James [[Bay]] remains the site of old wounds and much environ[[mental]], cultural,
and legal controversy. The results of my [[research]] indicate that the economic devel</p>
<p>opment throughout the past 30 years has seriously affected the [[Cree]] tallymen.
These findings provide important and new baseline information on impacts from</p>

<p>past development. Perhaps most pressing is the tallymen's loss of control over re
sources, loss of respect as a manager, and conflict within [[Cree]] communities. Eco</p>
<p>nomic development and cultural power shifts in [[Cree]] society as a result of the
JBNQA have resulted in a significant loss of control and a decline in the tallyman's</p>
<p>traditional managerial role. Tallymen also experienced strong feelings of emo
tional and spiritual loss as a result. Finally, these impacts on the [[Cree]] Tallymen also</p>
<p>have resulted in division and conflict within the [[Cree]] culture. Notably, a schism
between the tallymen as grassroots local managers and the regional authority of the
chiefs and Grand Chiefs and council was identified.</p>
<p>DISCUSSION/IMPLICATIONS</p>
<p>There are two key implications that arise from this [[research]]. First, this rese</p>
<p>has urgent and practical implications for the environ[[mental]] impact assessmen</p>
<p>Hydro-[[Québec]]'s proposed hydroelectric expansion, the Eastmain 1-A and R</p>
<p>diversion project. Second, there are broader implications for the study of ec</p>
<p>cally embedded managers such as [[Cree]] tallymen.</p>
<p>For the Proposed Expansion Project</p>
<p>Although ignored in most of the [[research]] on impacts of economic developm</p>
<p>the [[Cree]] tallymen are an important cultural and managerial group to consid</p>
<p>economic development plans continue. Such impacts should not be ignored
cause [[Cree]] tallymen have traditional cultural importance for the [[Cree]] and</p>
<p>have importance at large to the field of sustainable management (see Whitem</p>
<p>Cooper, [[2000]]).</p>
<p>Last [[August]], the [[Canadian]] Environ[[mental]] Protection Agency (CEAA, 200</p>
<p>released directives to guide the preparation of the impact statement for the</p>
<p>main 1-A and Rupert diversion project. These were approved by the Ministe</p>
<p>Environment and submitted to the Société de'energie de la Baie-James (SEB</p>
<p>subsidiary of Hydro- [[Québec]]. A review of these directives indicates that the Cre</p>
<p>general must be consulted on the EIA and that the traditional knowledge of
[[Cree]] also must be incorporated into baseline information for the assessment</p>
<p>also to help identify key issues. However, there is currently no explicit provisio</p>
<p>the directives to consult with the tallymen as a group on the proposed project</p>
<p>there is danger that their views may become subsumed under the [[Cree]] in gener</p>
<p>On the positive side, project impacts are supposed to be identified as a w</p>
<p>and also "according to each family hunting ground" (p. 9). The EIA directiv</p>
<p>require the proponent to describe the environment in terms of "the land regim</p>
<p>effect and the delimitation of [[Cree]] hunting grounds and a description of th</p>
<p>and management of their hunting grounds (current system of [[Cree]] hunting</p>
<p>ers)" (p. 23). A description of the social environment, including the transform</p>
<p>throughout the past 30 years, is also required and "this portrait must include</p>
<p>point of views of the [[Cree]]s, the elderly, [[adults]], youth and women on the dev</p>
<p>ment and on the [[health]], the social and economic benefits and impacts of dev</p>
<p>ment" (p.38). Hydro-[[Québec]] "must also describe the changes that have occurr</p>
<p>over the last 30 years, to the traditional use of the hunting grounds" (p. 42).</p>
<p>Consequently, the findings from my study have direct applicability and v</p>
<p>for this aspect of the EIA because it provides important baseline information on</p>
<p>[[Cree]] tallymen. These findings are particularly relevant given there is very littl</p>

<p>444 ORGANIZATION &amp; ENVIRONMENT / [[December]] [[2004]]</p>
<p>vious [[research]] on the impact of development on the tallymen who are the leaders of</p>
<p>the family hunting grounds (traplines).</p>
<p>After describing the baseline information, the EIA must then describe the im
pacts of the proposed expansion project (including the proposed new roads) on the</p>
<p>[[Cree]] land tenure system as well as on their social, economic, and cultural environ
ment. In addition, the Proponent must "identify and evaluate the Project's cumula
tive environ[[mental]] and social impacts combined with the effects of other existing
works or activities, that have been carried out over the last 30 years, or that are rea</p>
<p>sonably foreseeable over the next decade" (p. 48). Although my findings suggest
that tallymen were still able to actively pursue their traditional management ap</p>
<p>proach, additional economic development and cumulative impacts may seriously
compromise their ability to maintain this role in the future. Certainly, my findings</p>
<p>suggest that the proposed expansion project should anticipate that there may be
additional impacts for the tallymen in terms of a further loss of control, additional
loss of resources (particularly for those traplines most affected), greater loss of cul</p>
<p>tural importance and respect, as well as individual impacts such as emotional and
spiritual losses for [[Cree]] tallymen. These impacts may significantly compromise
tallymen's ability to enact their sustainable management role at the local level, un
less properly mitigated.
The EIA directives are important and clearly set the foundation for including an
analysis of the direct and indirect impacts on the [[Cree]] tallymen from the proposed</p>
<p>expansion. However, Hydro-[[Québec]]'s previous [[research]] (e.g., Guertin et al.,
[[1993]]) has consistently ignored [[Cree]] tallymen as an important and distinct group
and instead focused on positive benefits for the [[Cree]] as a whole. Yet my findings</p>
<p>strongly indicate that past development has seriously affected the tallymen and
suggest that future development will likely add to these unless proper mitigation
plans are enacted. Without effective mitigation measures, a further loss of control,</p>
<p>resources, and cultural respect will likely cause undue emotional and spiritual
problems for individual tallymen and could irreversibly compromise their ability
to enact in sustainable grassroots local management. These potential impacts must</p>
<p>be effectively identified and addressed in the EIA for a fair and equitable assess
ment of the project to be made.</p>
<p>The Loss of an</p>
<p>Ecologically Embedded Management Model
The value of the [[Cree]] tallymen goes far beyond the individual trapline. Their</p>
<p>ecologically embedded approach to management is valuable to other business
managers who are struggling to find their own sustainable pathways. Just as arche</p>
<p>ological sites have cultural value beyond their specific location, so too do the
tallymen.
At a basic level, economic development activities such as [[mining]], forestry, and
hydro and sports hunting impact the natural capital of the trapline. In addition, my</p>
<p>[[research]] findings indicate that economic development has resulted in significant
social impacts on the tallymen, particularly with respect to a loss of control over
resources and the loss of cultural respect for their ecologically embedded man</p>
<p>agement role. Such social impacts are likely to have additional environ[[mental]]
repercussions because the tallymen operate as grassroots environ[[mental]] stewards</p>
<p>(Whiteman &amp; Cooper, [[2000]]).</p>

<p>In the past, they have accomplished this job successfully (e.g., see Berkes, [[1995]],</p>
<p>[[1999]]). But without the tallyman's organized system of trapline management, the
ecological sustainability of the James [[Bay]] region may be questionable. Currently,</p>
<p>tallymen no longer have the authority to determine what happens on their lands—</p>
<p>in many cases, the chiefs and Grand Council now make economic development
decisions that would historically have been under the tallyman's geographic sphere</p>
<p>of control. Without control, sustainable resource management becomes difficult. If</p>
<p>tallymen cannot control access to resources or decisions on natural resource devel
opment, how can they continue to act as environ[[mental]] stewards?
The situation is complicated by the confusion about who has the right to negoti</p>
<p>ate with development [[companies]]—the tallyman, the chiefs, the Grand Council of</p>
<p>the [[Cree]]s, or some combination? The new Agreement for the expansion project
(and other future economic development), called "Peace of the Brave," does not
resolve this issue. Although the Peace of the Brave recognizes [[Cree]] ownership of
natural resources, it does not recognize the tallymen's traditional decision-making</p>
<p>powers, which are superseded by the Grand Council, local chiefs, and the [[Cree]]
community at large (across all nine villages). This problem is exacerbated by the
increasingly open access to the traplines provided by the expanded road infrastruc
ture to be used to support hydroelectric expansion. This may result in a further shift</p>
<p>toward "open access," resulting in yet another case of the "tragedy of the com
mons" (Hardin, [[1968]]).
The proposed Eastmain 1-A and Rupert diversion project will directly affect a
number of traplines, and thus directly affect the management practices of the tally</p>
<p>men in charge of these ecologies. This includes trapline R-21, where Freddy Jolly,</p>
<p>my key informant, resides and where I extensively studied the tallyman's ecologi</p>
<p>cally embedded approach to management. This project will seriously affect
Freddy's trapline: If the EIA is approved, the north section of trapline R-21 will be
under the water, flooded by part of the diversion bay. The classroom will be filled,</p>
<p>but not with students. The Rupert River, which runs through the rest of the trapline,</p>
<p>will be reduced to a small flow. The loss is not simply academic. Real-world sus
tainable managers, such as Freddy, are not common. Their practical models of sus</p>
<p>tainable management are extremely useful for learning about social-ecosystem
resilience and the role of the sustainable manager (see Whiteman &amp; Cooper, [[2000]]).</p>
<p>Until a comprehensive EIA (one that includes impacts specifically on or for
tallymen) is undertaken, the extent of the impacts on the management practices of</p>
<p>the tallymen is unclear. However, what is clear is that past impacts have already
compromised the tallymen's ability to enact their ecologically embedded approach
to management. Although historical development, such as the fur [[trade]], had many</p>
<p>impacts on the [[Cree]], the tallymen's ecologically embedded approach was able
to survive, partly because it built on this preexisting [[Indigenous]] approach to land
management.</p>
<p>Yet economic development throughout the past 30 years has ignored this pre
existing approach and legally shifted authority away from the tallymen toward less</p>
<p>ecologically embedded decision makers. The costs of this for the [[Cree]], for the
sustainability of James [[Bay]], and for the world at large are not known. Yet, as the</p>
<p>tallymen's approach is lost, so too is the managerial wisdom and practices of this
local sustainable manager. The concrete examples of [[Cree]] tallymen provide impor
tant beacons for practical guidance on sustainable management and must be pro
tected because there are so few other examples.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>When the late [[Québec]] [[Premier]] Robert Bourassa unveiled his master plan fo</p>
<p>James [[Bay]] Hydroelectric Project, "THE WORLD BEGINS TODAY" flash</p>
<p>screen (Busby, [[1991]], p. 8). In his dramatic introduction, Bourassa (like many</p>
<p>nizational and political leaders) demonstrated his ignorance of (and disregar</p>
<p>the préexistence of a natural world—the invisible "other" that came into being</p>
<p>when its landscape became ripe for economic development. And predic</p>
<p>enough, for the inhabitants of this "other" world (plants, wildlife, tallyme</p>
<p>other kind of world did begin that day—and the environ[[mental]] effects of it</p>
<p>immediate and monu[[mental]]. The social and cultural impacts have taken more</p>
<p>to be recognized, particularly for the [[Cree]] tallymen. My study attempts to fill
gap by providing ethnographic [[research]] on the impact of past development on</p>
<p>tallymen from the perspectives of the tallymen themselves.</p>
<p>This [[research]] is important because tallymen continue to have important cult</p>
<p>significance to the [[Cree]] and also broader significance to the field of sustain
management (Whiteman &amp; Cooper, [[2000]]). Furthermore, findings from this</p>
<p>provide valuable and essential baseline information for the EIA of the pro</p>

<p>The origins of this ecological collapse are not fully clear, although they can be att</p>

<p>[[Cree]] methods. Yet the [[Cree]] were in support of the conservation strategy and some commun</p>
<p>ties had already reached a consensus decision to stop trapping prior to the [[government]]</p>
<p>actions (Feit, [[1995]]). Furthermore, there is historical evidence that the [[Cree]] practiced bea</p>
<p>conservation in the mid-[[1800]]s (Francis &amp; Morantz, [[1983]]). One historical strategy utilize
by the [[Cree]] was to leave a portion of their lands untrapped. This strategy continues today</p>
