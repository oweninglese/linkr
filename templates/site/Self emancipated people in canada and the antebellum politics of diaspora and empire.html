<p>Early in [[1839]] a group of “coloured inhabitants” in Upper [[Canada]] gathered to<br />
draft a petition to the home [[government]] in London.^1 The memorial requested that<br />
the [[British]] [[government]] protect self-emancipated people from cross-border pursuit<br />
by [[United]] [[States]] authorities and ensure their social and intellectual advancement<br />
in [[Canada]]; and it did so on the grounds that the refugees were “subjects of the<br />
[[British]] Monarch.”^2 The letter was entrusted to Thomas Rolph, a [[white]] surgeon<br />
from England, who then asked the governor general of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] to<br />
forward it to the colonial secretary in London. To the petitioners’ dismay, no reply<br />
came. Suspecting that the governor general failed to act on Rolph’s request, they<br />
turned to George Arthur, lieutenant governor of Upper [[Canada]], who delivered the<br />
letter in [[May]] [[1839]].^3 After crossing the [[Atlantic]], the memorial circulated through<br />
the metropolitan administrative sphere, leaving the colonial secretary’s hands for<br />
the legal advisors to the [[Crown]].<br />
During the late [[1830]]s and early [[1840]]s, seeking to enjoy the full benefits of<br />
[[British]] freedom, formerly enslaved [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns from the [[United]] [[States]]<br />
developed communications linking [[Canada]] and the metropole and sought to incor-<br />
porate themselves into the [[empire]] through those networks. Expressions of [[British]]<br />
identity by black runaways are not particularly novel stories in the field of [[Africa]]n<br />
[[America]]n [[history]]; affiliation with [[Britain]] and its freedom is known to have been<br />
an appealing and strategic choice for escaping U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns not only<br />
for its symbolic power as the antithesis to U.S. [[slavery]], but also for what histori-<br />
an Van Gosse called [[Britain]]’s extensive presence as “an imperial totality.”^4<br />
Contextualizing U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns’ recourse to the [[Crown]] within [[Britain]]’s<br />
increasing assumption of abolitionist moral superiority to regain its imperial in[[flu]]-<br />
ence after [[1783]], Gosse described how the [[empire]]’s new post-Revolution agenda<br />
provided [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns in and outside the [[United]] [[States]] with a transatlantic<br />
apparatus within which to fight [[slavery]] through the [[empire]]’s economic, military,</p>

<p>cultural, and diplomatic channels. [[Canada]] was the most prominent “site for con-<br />
crete solidarity” where metropolitan and [[Canadian]] abolitionists successfully lob-<br />
bied administrators on behalf of cross-border runaways to prevent fugitive extra-<br />
ditions to the [[United]] [[States]].^5<br />
What has been absent from this narrative of [[British]]–[[Africa]]n [[America]]n [[alliance]]<br />
is that [[Britain]]’s moral and political imperative toward the self-emancipated did not<br />
become a matter of course. During the late [[1830]]s and early [[1840]]s, black refugees<br />
themselves had to actively solicit the metropole’s support by fashioning themselves<br />
as [[British]] emancipated subjects deserving of the [[empire]]’s protection and tutelage.<br />
Setting foot on [[British]] territory did not automatically lead to a recognition of<br />
[[British]] subjecthood; [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns who settled in [[Canada]] wrote letters, sub-<br />
mitted petitions, and held public meetings to appeal to metropolitan [[white]]s’ self-<br />
image as benevolent emancipators. With their undeterred efforts, formerly enslaved<br />
U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns convinced [[British]] abolitionists to treat the protection and<br />
advancement of their freedom as part of the imperial agenda, and to work for the<br />
successful circumvention of a bilateral extradition law with the [[United]] [[States]].<br />
In foregrounding cross-border runaways’ reconstitution of self in their new<br />
environment in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], I draw on work that highlights protean and<br />
contextual identity performances among mobile individuals in the [[Africa]]n<br />
Diaspora. Moving away from the traditional model that places diasporic subjects<br />
on a linear progression toward identity formation, these studies pay attention to<br />
shifting identifications articulated by those who traveled itinerantly over the<br />
course of their lifetimes and to their strategic self-fashioning within the cultural<br />
milieu of their immediate location.^6 Focus on the flexibility of identification<br />
adapted to “constantly shifting sets of sociopolitical demands” holds a particular<br />
resonance in the examination of formerly enslaved [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns who recog-<br />
nized the need to secure freedom and make progress within the social and politi-<br />
cal bounds of the [[British]] Empire.^7<br />
Their pursuit of imperial membership, I further argue, took place along racial<br />
lines, that is, through black diasporic affiliation. Self-emancipated [[Africa]]n<br />
[[America]]ns advanced their integration by identifying with West [[Indian]] freedpeo-<br />
ple—the legitimate and authentic beneficiaries of [[British]] emancipation. While<br />
metropolitan abolitionists sometimes lumped them with East [[Indian]]s under the<br />
category of [[British]] emancipated “blacks,” the refugees in [[Canada]] primarily equat-<br />
ed themselves with their fellow “[[British]] Negroes” in the West Indies and contin-<br />
ued to do so in the [[1850]]s, prompting participation of a black [[Jamaica]]n in this inter-<br />
colonial racial identification. In this sense, their diasporic identity formations<br />
reveal the potency of what historian Michael A. Gomez calls “a single status, a<br />
lone condition, that of blackness, of descent of [[Africa]]” as well as the powerful<br />
symbolic value of West [[Indian]]s in [[British]] freedom discourse.^8</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Emancipated People in [[Canada]] and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire</em></strong> <strong>221</strong></p>
<p>While articulating a sense of black collective advancement in the [[empire]], such<br />
diasporic identifications took shape within constricted institutional and discursive<br />
spheres delineated by inequitable racial structures of the post-emancipation [[empire]].<br />
The limitations and promises of [[British]] identity in “an [[empire]] founded on race”<br />
have been central themes in historical scholarship on “the black experience of<br />
Empire.”^9 Putting their diasporic politics in this light, this essay shows how propo-<br />
nents of [[British]] black identity had to navigate the straits of labor and cultural sys-<br />
tems of emancipation that were racially exploitative and denigrating. Because of<br />
their reliance on and genuine belief in [[Britain]]’s abolitionist authority, these [[Africa]]n-<br />
descended people were compelled to constitute their [[British]] identities within the<br />
ideologies and institutions of the burgeoning regime of freedom, but never fully<br />
conformed to its hierarchical structures of racial governance. “[[British]] Negroes”<br />
thus negotiated their place in the [[empire]] as they walked a delicate line between<br />
ambivalently reinforcing and subtly subverting its racial inequities.<br />
For cross-border runaways, black imperial identity was a double-edged sword:<br />
it connected them to [[Britain]]’s anti-[[slavery]] movement, but also to its asymmetrical<br />
orders of freedom. Within this narrow field of self-constitution and identity perform-<br />
ance, U.S.-origin refugees made the most of what was available to them as they real-<br />
ized the disturbing flexibility of the border between [[America]]n [[slavery]] and [[British]]<br />
freedom. Seeking protection and assistance from the metropole, they wrote and<br />
spoke as [[British]] subjects. What follows is an exploration of an [[Africa]]n [[America]]n<br />
politics that emerged within a nexus of [[British]] [[empire]] and [[Africa]]n Diaspora. Above<br />
all, it is a testament to self-emancipated people’s unflinching pursuit of freedom.</p>
<p><code>ENTERING THE EMPIRE</code></p>
<p>In the eyes of U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]n refugees, [[Canada]] was far from a land of<br />
complete freedom. The fragility of their free status was instituted by the Upper<br />
[[Canadian]] legislature in [[February]] [[1833]] with an act that provided for the extradition<br />
of “Fugitive Offenders from Foreign Countries,” under which individuals charged<br />
with “Murder, Forgery, Larceny, or other crime” could be returned to their origi-<br />
nal places of the alleged crime.^10 The law stipulated that the governor and the<br />
executive council could decide whether to surrender the charged person. While the<br />
fugitives might well have counted on the provincial authorities for compassion,<br />
historian Jason Silverman notes that the act “obviously threatened the freedom of<br />
all runaway [[slaves]] from the [[United]] [[States]]: first, because many [[slaves]] indeed com-<br />
mitted such crimes in the process of escaping; second, because slave owners might<br />
bring false charges in order to regain their [[property]].”^11<br />
The petitioners in the opening example denounced extradition as a breach of<br />
imperial [[sovereignty]], whereby “Her subjects” have “but too often been inveigled</p>

<p>and forced back into all the horrors of [[slavery]]” by “their former owners whose<br />
cupidity and thirst for power...will not consent to give up their supposed right<br />
over them, even though living under the protection of the [[British]] flag.”^12 The<br />
memorial recounted an arrest of an escaped individual from authorities in<br />
Kentucky who hunted him down to Upper [[Canada]] on charges of stealing a horse.<br />
The extradition was aborted only because “a body of his coloured brethren who<br />
like himself had escaped from the galling yoke of [[slavery]]” set the wanted man<br />
free.^13 These fugitives from the U.S. slave regime, “who were determined to per-<br />
ish to a man, rather than behold their brother surrendered up to the merciless feroc-<br />
ity of his former master,” lost two of their compatriots during the rescue. With the<br />
memory of the arrest and [[death]]s fresh in their minds, the petitioners ardently dis-<br />
played loyalty to the [[British]] Empire so as to “be regarded and considered as nat-<br />
uralized subjects of [[Great]] [[Britain]], to be alike protected by as well as rendered<br />
amenable to [[British]] law.”^14<br />
In addition to [[government]]al protection against extraditions, the memorial<br />
requested the promotion of schools for [[Africa]]n [[America]]n [[child]]ren on the grounds<br />
that [[government]]al funds had been expended on the education of freedpeople in the<br />
[[British]] West Indies. Casting their appeal in a nationalist light and linking it to their<br />
willingness to “become good Christians, good subjects, and enlightened members<br />
of the community,” the petitioners cited “the liberal and munificent donations<br />
bestowed on their brethren in the West Indies by Her Majesty’s Government, for<br />
the purpose of promoting their moral and religious instruction.”^15 By identifying<br />
themselves as the [[Canadian]] counterpart of the West [[Indian]] emancipated people,<br />
the memorialists justified their hope that “some aid [would] be extended to the<br />
colored population of Upper [[Canada]].”^16<br />
The “donations” given to the West [[Indian]]s included the “Negro Education<br />
Grant,” a subsidy from the imperial [[government]] initiated in [[1835]] for the educa-<br />
tion of the formerly enslaved population.^17 This policy emerged against the back-<br />
drop of the home [[government]]’s broader endeavor to institute a “structure of labor<br />
control” designed to ensure the freedpeople’s productivity under the new princi-<br />
ples of wage labor.^18 Embedded in the tenets of bourgeois political economy, this<br />
state-initiated effort went beyond economic concerns and aimed at changing the<br />
overall structure of the former slave colonies into “the right sort of society and cul-<br />
ture.”^19 In that model, according to Thomas C. Holt, freedpeople would act in pur-<br />
suit of “personal accumulation and [in] deference to proper authority” within a<br />
gendered social order divided into the masculinized terrain of wage work and the<br />
feminized domestic realm of reproduction and consumption.^20 The educational<br />
effort was thus a bid to transform emancipated West [[Indian]]s into colonial free<br />
laborers with the proper intellect, piety, industry, and material desires deemed nec-<br />
essary to ensure stable agricultural production.</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Emancipated People in [[Canada]] and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire</em></strong> <strong>223</strong></p>
<p>This new principle of free labor, however, contradicted both the reality of the<br />
[[plantation]]s and freedpeople’s own economic and social objectives. Emancipated<br />
people in [[Jamaica]], for example, sought to manage their labor at their own discre-<br />
tion as they combined [[plantation]] work and small-scale cultivation for self-suffi-<br />
ciency and local market exchange.^21 Also, if some women withdrew from estate<br />
labor, it was not because they complied with bourgeois gender ideology; rather,<br />
they sought protection from grueling physical drudgery and assurance of the sur-<br />
vival of their domestic and communal life independent of the planter class.^22 In<br />
accordance with these alternative ethics, freedmen and women carved out a social,<br />
familial, and economic life that conflicted with the maximization of profits from<br />
wage-based estate production.<br />
Likewise, the petitioners in [[Canada]] showed no sign of perceiving themselves<br />
as wage laborers as they appropriated the powerful national banner of post-eman-<br />
cipation “reform.” Their aspirations for intellectual and moral improvement were<br />
divorced from the capitalist principle of labor efficiency. Their vision was to repli-<br />
cate in [[Canada]] institutions of emancipation devoid of liberal economic functions<br />
and to use them to create a self-sustaining population of self-emancipated people.<br />
The imperial [[government]]’s response to the [[1839]] petition boded poorly for the<br />
security of the freedom of fugitives from U.S. [[slavery]]. The return dispatch from<br />
London mentioned the [[Queen]]’s “satisfaction at the sentiments of ardent attach-<br />
ment to Her Person and Government” expressed by the petitioners, but exhibited<br />
the [[British]] [[government]]’s passive stance on fugitive slave extradition. It cited a<br />
report of the Law Officers of the [[Crown]] that “under the existing law of Upper<br />
[[Canada]] no difference was made between colored and [[white]] men—between fugi-<br />
tive [[slaves]] and other individuals arriving in [[Canada]] from the [[United]] [[States]]—and<br />
that it would not be lawful to deliver up a fugitive slave in any circumstances in<br />
which a [[white]] man would not also be delivered up.”^23 In sum, the report conclud-<br />
ed that cross-border runaways would not be subjected to a higher chance of extra-<br />
dition than would [[white]] individuals, but that neither would there be any special<br />
legal shield for the former. The dispatch stated that this principle, if implemented<br />
properly, was “amply sufficient for the protection of the petitioners” and that<br />
beyond the equal application of the law “Her Majesty has no power to advance,<br />
nor to grant to one class of Her Subjects privileges or immunities not enjoyed by<br />
others.”^24 With regard to the promotion of educational facilities, the secretary<br />
directed the petitioners to appeal to the provincial legislature.<br />
It should be noted, however, that while the home [[government]] promised no<br />
special protection or educational opportunities for U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns fleeing<br />
to [[Canada]], the correspondence suggests a certain degree of success in introducing<br />
them into official imperial discourse as one group of black [[British]] subjects. To<br />
begin, the lieutenant governor of Upper [[Canada]] found the petition by “Her</p>

<p><strong>224</strong> <strong><em>The Journal of [[Africa]]n [[America]]n History</em></strong></p>
<p>Majesty’s coloured subjects,” as he called them, legitimate enough to place it in<br />
the imperial administrative network.^25 The officials in London then defined the<br />
home [[government]]’s approach toward the protection of the refugees’ freedom.<br />
While the decision was not to implement any concrete measures, the reason for the<br />
inaction—that “Her Majesty has no power to advance, nor to grant to one class of<br />
Her Subjects privileges or immunities not enjoyed by others”—implies recogni-<br />
tion that these formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns were indeed “Her<br />
Subjects.”^26<br />
This limited victory did not immediately change the grim reality facing self-<br />
emancipated people. The officials viewed fugitive slave extradition as a legitimate<br />
bilateral system, not an aggression on state [[sovereignty]] that the memorial made it<br />
out to be. To black refugees from the [[United]] [[States]] the absence of [[slavery]] in<br />
[[Canada]] was a [[British]] condition that should be maintained within its colonial<br />
boundaries. Thus, any exertion of U.S. jurisdiction in [[Canada]] signified an infiltra-<br />
tion of the border between [[British]] freedom and [[America]]n [[slavery]]. This rigid sep-<br />
aration of free and unfree spaces did not win the hearts of [[British]] officials, who<br />
were well aware of the role of diplomatic relations in shaping the operation of the<br />
U.S.-[[Canadian]] border.<br />
Outside official imperial networks, inter-colonial diasporic identities flour-<br />
ished in various cultural venues in [[Canada]]. An [[1839]] prospectus for the periodical<br />
<em>The [[British]] [[America]]n Journal of Liberty</em> was a case in point. In solidifying the<br />
identity of the black newcomers as “Her Majesty’s Coloured subjects in Upper<br />
[[Canada]],” the editors Peter Gallego and E. L. De St. Remy looked southward to<br />
another group of emancipated people for political and racial association. The two<br />
men promised to report on “the progress of our fellow subjects in the West Indies,”<br />
a promise reflective of their diasporic identity as well as their referential use of the<br />
West [[Indian]]s to gauge the prospects and possibilities available for the emancipat-<br />
ed [[Africa]]n-descended people in the [[empire]].^27<br />
The practice of inter-colonial identification very likely developed out of the<br />
annual imperial emancipation celebrations that originated in the West Indies to pub-<br />
licly display and nurture loyal sentiments around the [[British]] abolition of [[slavery]].^28<br />
The patriotic function of these rituals differed from the much-discussed politics of<br />
West [[Indian]] emancipation in the [[United]] [[States]] that championed the event as a rally-<br />
ing point to oppose U.S. [[slavery]].^29 Rather in [[Canada]], [[British]] emancipation became<br />
a symbol around which self-emancipated people forged commonality with those in<br />
the West Indies as subject beneficiaries of that policy. An [[1841]] imperial emancipa-<br />
tion celebration illustrates this point. In Chatham, [[Canada]], one of the Detroit River<br />
border towns, formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns explicitly cast themselves<br />
as one group of emancipated subjects who were enjoying the blessings of the [[1833]]<br />
act, and they “celebrated the important event of their emancipation throughout the</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Emancipated People in [[Canada]] and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire</em></strong> <strong>225</strong></p>
<p>[[British]] dominions—in a manner, too, that showed the value and consequence<br />
attached by them to the boon of freedom.”^30 The celebrations included a procession<br />
that “paraded through the streets for some time, to the number of about one hundred”<br />
and a festive dinner in the evening, after which “they figured away in the merry<br />
dance until a late hour.”^31 Similarly, three years later, at a meeting of black refugees<br />
in the same town, they expressed their gratitude for “what [[[Britain]] had] done and<br />
thanked “her noble statesmen” for “break[ing] the fetters of the Slave.”^32 Here the<br />
“Slave” referred to the formerly enslaved [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns in [[Canada]] (many<br />
refugees from the [[United]] [[States]]) and “our brethren in the West Indies,” both<br />
“Coloured Subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty [[Queen]] Victoria.”^33<br />
These sentiments and performances of [[British]] identity circulated in print<br />
through newspapers and eventually reached London. In [[1840]] their voice also<br />
entered metropolitan abolitionist circles through the medium of the same Thomas<br />
Rolph. This time, Rolph used as his platform the World Anti-Slavery Convention<br />
of [[June]] [[1840]], convened by the [[British]] and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS),<br />
a fledgling London-based abolitionist organization. Self-emancipated people’s<br />
call for help resonated well at the convention conceived to present new directions<br />
for [[British]] abolitionism in the post-emancipation era.<br />
At this international forum, U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]n runaways constituted the<br />
convention’s agenda under the category “Condition of the Emancipated,” which<br />
also included important information on [[Africa]]n-descended peoples in Haiti, [[South]]<br />
[[America]], and the [[British]] West Indies.^34 As the primary messenger on behalf of<br />
black refugees, Rolph not only presented to the metropolitan audience their capac-<br />
ities to be ideal colonial subjects, but also conveyed their own ideas of [[British]]<br />
freedom and identity.^35<br />
The highlight of Rolph’s presentation was an excerpt of a meeting of<br />
“Coloured People at Ancaster,” [[Canada]], convened earlier to draft appeals to the<br />
imperial and provincial [[government]]s, with the intent of sharing them at the World<br />
Anti-Slavery Convention.^36 In a tone similar to the [[1839]] memorial, the partici-<br />
pants announced that they “emigrate to this and other [[British]] colonies to enjoy that<br />
[[liberty]] and protection which alone is afforded by the [[British]] Government and law”<br />
and asked the provincial legislature and the [[Crown]] to enact a law providing for a<br />
trial by jury for an alleged fugitive before he or she “shall be handed over to the<br />
authorities of the [[United]] [[States]].”^37 After the address, Rolph and five abolitionists<br />
from different cities in the [[British]] Isles founded a committee, which recommend-<br />
ed that the convention press the issue with colonial administrators in [[Canada]].^38<br />
With the increasing outcry from [[Canada]], metropolitan abolitionists began to<br />
discuss self-emancipated people along with other groups of the [[British]] emancipat-<br />
ed. There is evidence that black refugees in [[Canada]] were associated with recently<br />
emancipated black West [[Indian]]s within the context of a distinctly imperial govern-</p>

<p>ing structure: the itinerant appointment of administrative officers to different colo-<br />
nial posts. In [[1843]] Thomas Clarkson, the driving force behind [[British]] emancipa-<br />
tion, appealed to Charles Metcalf, the governor of [[Canada]] who once governed<br />
[[Jamaica]] as well, for the protection of [[Africa]]n [[America]]n escapees in his province.<br />
In his communication Clarkson painted a picture of runaways becoming “produc-<br />
tive of great good to <em>the mother country</em> ” as they were “a <em>quiet</em> and <em>orderly</em> peo-<br />
ple” who gave “no trouble to the [[government]].”^39 What is notable is that Clarkson<br />
founded the plausibility of this blueprint upon “the <em>spirit of independency</em> , the<br />
<em>industry</em> and the <em>prodigious execution</em> of the <em>free [N]egro</em> in [[Jamaica]],” which,<br />
Clarkson claimed, “No one knows better than Your Excellency.”^40<br />
In expressing his confidence that Metcalf would “protect the unhappy fugi-<br />
tives against the claims of an enraged master,” Clarkson posited a paternalistic<br />
image of the governor as a colonial administrator who routinely presided over dif-<br />
ferent groups of freedpeople living throughout the [[empire]]. “When he left his<br />
Government at [[Jamaica]],” Clarkson declared, “ten thousand emancipated [[slaves]]<br />
followed him to the water’s edge with tears, to take their leave of him. He is the<br />
same benevolent man in [[Canada]], as he was in [[Jamaica]] as favors the poor [N]egro<br />
is concerned.”^41 The cultural figure of the benevolent [[British]] governor with inter-<br />
colonial mobility went hand in hand with a vision of separately located emanci-<br />
pated peoples contributing to imperial prosperity under an itinerant administrator.<br />
The system of rotating colonial governorship thus helped link distant emancipat-<br />
ed subjects within the [[white]] imperial imagination.<br />
More importantly, [[Africa]]n ancestry was not the exclusive register of common-<br />
ality for metropolitan abolitionists. They went beyond [[Canada]] and the West Indies<br />
in their mapping of the [[British]] emancipated to include East [[Indian]]s in Malabar<br />
who had been freed by the East India Company in [[1836]]. In [[1846]], three years after<br />
Clarkson’s correspondence with Metcalf, abolitionist William T. Blair made the<br />
connection between the self-emancipated people in [[Canada]] and freedpeople in the<br />
coastal region of southwestern India.^42 The abolitionist from Bath asked the<br />
BFASS leadership to publish his letter, which stressed the [[British]] [[government]]’s<br />
duty of “elevating the [[slaves]] to a real state of freedom” and the need for quick<br />
implementation of [[government]]al systems of education.^43 The areas of concern<br />
were two [[British]] colonial spaces—[[Canada]] and East India:</p>
<p><code>The [[government]] ought to provide funds for schools, and authorize their offices in the provinces
of [[Canada]] and Malabar to appropriate [[government]] lands and to afford every facility to their
instruction and amelioration. At present nothing is done but by sufferance. The [[government]]
do[es] not actually impede, but the next thing to it,—what is required is a positive order to this
[[government]] to forward the education, and the amelioration of the classes in every possible way,
and to countenance and assist every population for the freedom secured to them by [[British]] law.^44</code></p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Emancipated People in [[Canada]] and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire</em></strong> <strong>227</strong></p>
<p>In Blair’s mind, both East [[Indian]]s and formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns<br />
in [[Canada]] were [[British]] emancipated subjects and their successful transition to<br />
freedom represented the triumph of the imperial move to abolition.<br />
The coupling of the two groups made sense given the [[history]] of racial group-<br />
ing in the metropole. By the late 18th century, East [[Indian]] seamen, or lascars,<br />
became a visible presence in English seaport cities. Called “Asiatic blacks” by<br />
metropolitan [[white]]s, [[South]] Asians constituted the “blacks,” along with people of<br />
Sub-Saharan [[Africa]]n descent. In [[1786]] they became an object of a private (and later<br />
[[government]]-funded) relief effort aimed at the “black poor” in London, a designa-<br />
tion covering both East [[Indian]] and West [[Indian]] “blacks” in London, often identi-<br />
fied by their impoverished condition and need of [[British]] benevolence. Criminal<br />
records and Parliamentary Papers reveal that this situation for the black poor con-<br />
tinued well into the 19th century.^45 Within this cultural milieu William Blair artic-<br />
ulated the association between emancipated “blacks” in Malabar and [[Canada]] and<br />
the need to establish imperial policy appropriate for both.<br />
Despite abolitionists’ growing recognition of formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n<br />
[[America]]ns in [[Canada]] as emancipated [[British]] subjects, the imperial [[government]]<br />
allowed an extradition back to the [[United]] [[States]] in [[1842]], which was in some ways<br />
not surprising given the reaction to the [[1839]] petition from [[Canada]]. The protago-<br />
nist, Nelson Hackett, was a runaway and fugitive from Arkansas who succeeded<br />
in crossing the Detroit River sometime in [[September]] [[1841]]. He was tracked down<br />
and arrested by two slave catchers from Arkansas and charged with stealing a<br />
beaver overcoat, a [[gold]] watch, a saddle, and a horse from his master and others.<br />
The [[Washington]] County Grand Jury of Arkansas had indicted Hackett for grand<br />
larceny, and Arkansas [[Governor]] Archibald Yell requested that the [[Canadian]] gov-<br />
ernment surrender Hackett as a “criminal” fugitive. In [[January]] [[1842]], the governor<br />
general of [[Canada]], Charles Bagot, ordered that Hackett be turned over to<br />
Arkansas. In response, BFASS secretary John Scoble labored to find ways to<br />
block the extradition, contacting diverse parties in the [[United]] [[States]] and England,<br />
including [[America]]n Lewis Tappen and the [[British]] Colonial Office. Unfortunately,<br />
the group’s efforts did not bear fruit and the extradition took place later in [[1842]].^46<br />
On the heels of Nelson Hackett’s surrender to U.S. slave catchers came a new<br />
challenge to the freedom of [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns escaping to [[Canada]]: the Webster-<br />
Ashburton [[Treaty]], a new U.S.-[[British]] bilateral agreement under negotiation in</p>
<p>[[1842]]. The specific issue was Article 10 of the [[treaty]] that provided for the mutual<br />
      surrender of fugitive “criminals” and thus placed in jeopardy the freedom of black<br />
      refugees living in [[Canada]]. Fearing that the article would be applied specifically to<br />
      fugitive “[[slaves]]” in [[Canada]] and other [[British]] territories, the BFASS campaigned<br />
      for their exemption, petitioning the Parliament; the Foreign Secretary, George</p>

<p>Hamilton-Gordon, the Fourth Earl of Aberdeen; and Alexander Baring, the First<br />
Baron of Ashburton, who authored the [[treaty]].^47<br />
The BFASS’s campaign could not have occurred without the untiring appeals<br />
from escaped [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns themselves who managed to persuade the aboli-<br />
tionists that the refugees were entitled to freedom as [[British]] subjects. Such recog-<br />
nition also in[[flu]]enced the way the self-emancipated were constructed in the<br />
BFASS’s annual reports. The [[June]] [[1843]] report covered the period of the Hackett<br />
extradition and the Webster-Ashburton [[Treaty]]; the issue of “fugitive [[slaves]]”<br />
appeared in the “Home Operations” section pertaining to [[slavery]] and post-eman-<br />
cipation conditions in the [[British]] colonies, not in “Foreign Operations,” which<br />
covered individuals the society considered “non-[[British]] subjects” such as the<br />
enslaved populations in the [[United]] [[States]] and Brazil.^48 “Fugitive [[Slaves]] within the<br />
[[British]] Dominions” was also added to the group’s agenda, and was listed with<br />
concerns about post-emancipation conditions in the [[British]] West Indies, antislav-<br />
ery campaigns in [[British]] East India and [[British]] settlements in [[South]]east Asia, and<br />
enslaved “[[British]] subjects” in the [[Spanish]] and [[Dutch]] colonies.^48 Further illustrat-<br />
ing the society’s interests, the “Home Operations” section of the BFASS’s fourth<br />
annual report concluded with an exhortation that the extradition issue required<br />
“the best attention of [[British]] abolitionists.”^50<br />
The [[British]] [[government]] soon backed away from the enforcement of Webster-<br />
Ashburton’s Article 10 on fugitive slave extraditions. This was triggered in [[1844]]<br />
when seven enslaved workers from Florida escaped to Nassau in the Bahamas;<br />
they faced a risk of extradition on charges of murder in the [[United]] [[States]]. The<br />
[[British]] [[government]], having adopted a policy of preventing extraditions on the<br />
basis of procedural technicalities, successfully argued that the documents submit-<br />
ted were insufficient to prove the fugitives’ crime.^51 [[Britain]]’s stance was further<br />
consolidated when Foreign Secretary Aberdeen refused to concede to the U.S.<br />
[[government]]’s request for the invocation of Article 10 in fugitive slave cases.^52 By<br />
[[1845]] [[British]] abolitionists concluded [[British]] soil to be safe from the voracious<br />
force of the U.S. authorities. With their persistent assertions of free [[British]] identi-<br />
ty, self-emancipated people successfully elicited support and protection from met-<br />
ropolitan abolitionists and [[British]] officials.</p>
<h3>ARTICULATIONS OF “THE BRITISH NEGRO”</h3>
<p>Acutely aware that the West [[Indian]] freedpeople constituted a primary symbol<br />
of [[British]] emancipation and progress, formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns<br />
living in [[Canada]] continued to forge a common identity with their Caribbean coun-<br />
terparts. After the passage of the [[1850]] Fugitive Slave Law, which led to a substan-<br />
tial increase in the number of cross-border black migrants, identification with</p>

<p><strong><em>Self-Emancipated People in [[Canada]] and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire</em></strong> <strong>229</strong></p>
<p>Afro-West [[Indian]]s proliferated in [[Africa]]n [[America]]n public discourse inside and<br />
outside [[Canada]]. Samuel Ring[[gold]] [[War]]d, a seasoned [[Africa]]n [[America]]n abolition-<br />
ist from [[New]] York, spearheaded this identification. In many ways [[War]]d was not a<br />
typical runaway, for he had escaped from [[slavery]] at the age of three with his par-<br />
ents and had lived as a free person in [[New]] York State until he fled to [[Canada]].<br />
Although with no personal memory of enslavement, he saw himself as a fugitive<br />
from U.S. [[slavery]], but for a slightly different reason. In [[October]] [[1851]] [[War]]d and<br />
other members of the Syracuse Vigilance Committee rescued runaway Jerry<br />
McHenry from federal authorities and helped him escape to [[King]]ston, [[Canada]].<br />
[[War]]d and Jermain Loguen, the vice chairman of the vigilance committee, soon<br />
afterward left for [[Canada]] themselves, fearing arrest for obstructing the Fugitive<br />
Slave Law.^53 Equating his escape from arrest with escaping workers’ flight from<br />
re-enslavement, both fleeing the pro-[[slavery]] regime, [[War]]d declared to fugitive<br />
Henry Bibb, “I am, like yourself, a refugee.”^54</p>
<p><code>Samuel R. [[War]]d</code></p>
<p>Samuel [[War]]d constructed an idealized black West [[Indian]] figure by articulat-<br />
ing visions of freedom and belonging for his oppressed people. He built a com-<br />
mon black [[British]] identity upon both differences and commonalities between “this<br />
large and growing class of Her Majesty’s subjects” in [[Canada]] and “the descen-</p>

<p>dants of [[Africa]], in other parts of the [[empire]].”^55 Noting that “the blacks in the West<br />
Indies, now among the wealthiest, most learned and most in[[flu]]ential of Her<br />
Majesty’s colonial subjects, were, a century ago, poor and as illiterate as we are<br />
now [due to what] Slavery did to them.” [[War]]d proclaimed to his fellow refugees,<br />
“What they are, we must be. We must become such by our own efforts, as did they.<br />
We cannot begin too soon.”^56 In explaining his decision to found a black newspa-<br />
per in [[Canada]], [[War]]d defined it as an advocate for the social, economic, and polit-<br />
ical advancement of formerly enslaved people and to raise them “to the proud<br />
position of the blacks in other parts of our glorious [[empire]].”^57 In his blueprint for<br />
the future within the [[British]] Empire, the West [[Indian]] freedpeople served as a<br />
model of progress for recent arrivals from the [[United]] [[States]].<br />
[[War]]d also intended this inter-colonial affiliation to help him solicit assistance<br />
from the metropolitan public since he was fully aware of the utility of the West<br />
[[Indian]] freedpeople—the most prominent symbol of [[British]] benevolent paternal-<br />
ism—in appealing to [[white]] Britons’ pride as benefactors of emancipation and<br />
progress. During his tour around the [[British]] Isles to raise funds on former [[slaves]]’<br />
behalf, [[War]]d categorized emancipated black West [[Indian]]s and [[Canadian]]s, and<br />
self-emancipated U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns in [[Canada]] as the “[[British]] Negro,”<br />
ascribing to them devotion to imperial prosperity and to Christian faith.^58<br />
In his speeches throughout the [[United]] [[King]]dom, [[War]]d emphasized the contri-<br />
bution of [[Africa]]n-descended subjects to the af[[flu]]ence of the [[empire]], categorizing<br />
black West [[Indian]]s and [[Canadian]]s as one distinct group of colonial laborers.<br />
“Indeed to the [[British]] people,” he claimed at a public meeting, “was committed a<br />
very large proportion of the [N]egro race.”^59 “How many of that race,” he contin-<br />
ued, “were labouring for the [[welfare]] of [[Great]] [[Britain]] in the West Indies and in<br />
[[Canada]]? What did the Almighty mean by this, but that sympathies should be<br />
awakened in the minds of the [[British]] people, and be practically realised, for the<br />
future [[welfare]] of the oppressed and the down-trodden.”^60<br />
Indeed, [[War]]d’s invocation of the two groups’ status as black colonial laborers<br />
was both reinforcing and transgressing what historian Seymour Drescher calls the<br />
“racialization of labor and migration in the [[British]] political imagination” in the<br />
mid-19th century.^61 On the one hand, his appeal grounded black West [[Indian]]s’<br />
imperial belonging in their tropical labor, which ambivalently locked them in a<br />
racially exploitative relationship to the [[empire]]. On the other hand, self-emancipat-<br />
ed people unsettled the racial boundaries of [[Canadian]] settler [[colonialism]], which<br />
by this time was manifested in anti-black [[[[protest]]s]] by [[white]] colonists who assert-<br />
ed exclusive ownership of [[Canadian]] land by “thousands of our countrymen of our<br />
own color.”^62 In light of the racially unsettling nature of black presence in a [[white]]<br />
settler [[colony]], [[War]]d’s definition of black belonging can be seen as a radical act in<br />
its disruption of the racialized structures of the free labor [[empire]].</p>

<p><code>COLONIAL M[[[[ISS]]I]]ONARIES AND RA[[CIA]]L STRUCTURES</code></p>
<p>In addition to labor, [[War]]d invoked religious piety—a characteristic believed<br />
to reside in an ideal colonial subject and thus cited by diverse “black” groups with-<br />
in the [[empire]] as a marker of their [[British]] identity.^63 In [[1854]] [[War]]d proudly<br />
announced that “the preaching of the gospel was attended with great success<br />
amongst them [the self-emancipated in [[Canada]]], and that they were as loyal as any<br />
of her Majesty’s subjects. The same might be said of the West Indies.”^64 Framing<br />
the two peoples as equally devout populations despite their past enslavement,<br />
[[War]]d lent legitimacy to his claim for metropolitan aid.<br />
Such inter-colonial diasporic identification was further [[foster]]ed by black West<br />
[[Indian]]s within a racially structured colonial missionary apparatus. Rev. Robert<br />
Gordon, a preacher from [[Jamaica]], forged a common black identity informed by<br />
the past diasporic experience of enslavement and the current freedom in the<br />
[[British]] Empire as he worked for a mission to the self-emancipated [[Africa]]n<br />
[[America]]ns in [[Canada]]. The mission, operated by the Colonial Church and School<br />
Society, was first proposed at a committee meeting in [[April]] [[1853]] and became<br />
known as the “Fugitive Slave Mission” by [[1856]]. The religious venture had two<br />
goals: abolition of U.S. [[slavery]] and the social uplift of black colonial subjects.^65<br />
The Fugitive Slave Mission was devised with the hopes that “the spectacle of a<br />
large body of the [N]egro race, elevated in social and religious condition, and<br />
walking like Christian men in the light of the Gospel” would help effect abolition-<br />
ist campaigns in the [[United]] [[States]].^66 At the same time, the mission was considered<br />
an endeavor to advance the religious training of fellow [[British]] subjects. “Our<br />
attention,” the society declared, “has been called to the miserable condition of the<br />
fugitive colored population in our own [[colony]] of [[Canada]],” who “as our fellow<br />
subjects, have a special claim on our regard.”^67<br />
The Colonial Church and School Society, with many branches dominated by<br />
women, offered an institutional and ideological frame—albeit a narrow one—for<br />
developing a common racial identity among [[Africa]]n-descended colonial subjects<br />
in the [[empire]]. In the annual report of the year [[1856]]–[[1857]], the period during which<br />
its West [[Indian]] missions went into operation, religious instruction for self-eman-<br />
cipated people in [[Canada]] and “the emancipated [N]egroes of the West Indies”<br />
were identified as two branches of one larger project of “civilizing the [[Africa]]n<br />
race” within the [[empire]].^68 The report set the two groups side by side, pleading for<br />
“the sympathies of [[British]] Christians of the beautiful and now impoverished West<br />
India islands, where such openings are being made for the labors of the Society;<br />
of the fugitive [[slaves]] also, who are annually seeking the protection of the [[British]]<br />
[[empire]] on [[Canadian]] soil.”^69<br />
The society’s mission in [[Jamaica]] inspired Gordon to develop an interest in its</p>

<p>Fugitive Slave Mission. He acquainted himself with the society’s officers sta-<br />
tioned in [[Jamaica]], who may well have informed Rev. Gordon that there was anoth-<br />
er emancipated population under the instruction of the society. Also, missionary<br />
publications very likely reached [[Jamaica]] and piqued Gordon’s interest in the proj-<br />
ect, generating in him a sense of common destiny with his fellow subjects in<br />
[[Canada]]. Eventually, Gordon applied for a position in the Fugitive Slave Mission<br />
and, after successfully passing an interview with the society, he was recommend-<br />
ed to the [[Bishop]] of [[Huron]] as a catechist.^70</p>
<p><code>“Mission to the Fugitive [[Slaves]] in [[Canada]]” ([[1856]]).</code></p>
<p>Rev. Gordon’s identification with self-emancipated people in [[Canada]] devel-<br />
oped within the unequal race relations of the colonial missions. The appointment of<br />
Gordon to [[Canada]] was in accordance with metropolitan [[white]]s’ understanding that<br />
the Fugitive Slave Mission required expertise in “the characteristics of the [[Africa]]n<br />
race” that mostly took on negative connotations, evident in the officers’ statement<br />
that former [[slaves]] were in “the lowest state of ignorance of religion, and even of<br />
secular knowledge.”^71 Indeed, the society had already appointed [[white]] missionar-<br />
ies with experience in the West Indies and hired women of [[Africa]]n descent. Those<br />
appointed, Rev. M. M. Dillon and a lay missionary named Ballantine, had worked<br />
in Dominica, the former as rector and the latter as teacher for the Mico Charity in<br />
charge of instructing “the colored boys.”^72 At Dillon’s request, the positions of</p>

<p>infant school teachers were filled by “two young colored females named Titre,” sis-<br />
ters who had accompanied Ballantine from Dominica and were then studying at the<br />
Home and Colonial Institution, the society’s school for the training of missionaries<br />
to be sent across the [[empire]].^73 Rev. Gordon’s work was set within this doubly hier-<br />
archical structure of colonial missionary operations, where [[white]]s’ sense of<br />
supremacy over emancipated populations underlined their evangelizing projects;<br />
and where relocated black subjects worked in a subordinate position to [[white]] mis-<br />
sionaries.</p>
<p><code>“Sh[o]wing the Principal Stations of the Free Colored Population,” circa [[1850]].</code></p>
<p>Gordon’s interstitial position was revealed in the remaining records that docu-<br />
mented his racial identification as well as the inequitable colonial governance. On the<br />
first day of [[August]] [[1859]], Rev. Gordon delivered a sermon to the “colored citizens of<br />
London, [[Canada]], and several other places” who gathered at St. Paul’s Cathedral on<br />
the “the 21st Anniversary of the Emancipation of the black and colored [[slaves]] of the<br />
[[British]] West Indies.”^74 Following the tradition of [[British]] emancipation celebrations in<br />
[[Canada]], Gordon urged his audience to celebrate the occasion as fellow beneficiaries<br />
of freedom along with those in the West Indies, concluding that “it well becomes the<br />
colored people to consider this day as a Festival; since enjoying here, as they can do<br />
wherever the [[British]] Banner is unfurled, as indicative of territorial possession, the<br />
blessed privilege of sitting unmolested under their own vine and fig tree, protected as<br />
well as their [[white]] brethren by laws which are impartially administered.”^75</p>

<p><strong>234</strong> <strong><em>The Journal of [[Africa]]n [[America]]n History</em></strong></p>
<p>From his perspective as a missionary, the enjoyment of freedom under the<br />
[[British]] flag meant the acceptance of educational and religious instruction at the<br />
mission, through which his understanding of a common diasporic identity was<br />
articulated. “I would specially address my colored brethren,” Rev. Gordon exhort-<br />
ed, “on the necessity of their practically exhibiting their appreciation of, and grat-<br />
itude for, the efforts which that most estimable Institution, the Colonial Church<br />
and School Society, are making for their moral, social, and religious advancement,<br />
through the male and female agents sent to them.”^76 Although expressing a unified<br />
racial identity with his “colored brethren,” his attachment to the colonial mission-<br />
ary hierarchy led Gordon to reiterate its racial tenets, patronizingly instructing<br />
black [[Canadian]]s to appreciate [[white]] evangelists, who “benevolently hold out their<br />
hands to you,” and to depend on them for moral education because black parents<br />
were “generally...incapable of religiously instructing [their] [[child]]ren.”^77<br />
As passionate a worker as he was, less than four months after the sermon, the<br />
society discharged Rev. Gordon from his position due to the “indiscretion” he<br />
committed, namely collecting funds for a new church building without permission<br />
from the [[white]] missionary officers in [[Canada]] and London.^78 Rev. Gordon left<br />
[[Canada]] for the West Indies in late [[January]] [[1860]] and on the eve of his return, he<br />
penned a letter to the committee in England “pray[ing] for the prosperity of the<br />
Society.”^79<br />
Censured for bypassing [[white]] authorities, Gordon’s departure illustrated the<br />
asymmetrical power relations on which he hoped to forge a united [[British]] identi-<br />
ty among [[Africa]]n diasporic populations. Since black colonial subjecthood was<br />
embedded in the racial hierarchies of [[empire]], diasporic identities that emerged<br />
within them consequently faced narrow and constrained realms of formation and<br />
development. Not only regulated discursively by colonial racial paradigms,<br />
Gordon’s aspirations for collective improvement were quickly shattered once he<br />
overstepped the boundaries of colonial missionary rule.</p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>The post-emancipation [[British]] Empire enabled diasporic mappings by dis-<br />
persed freedpeople for political use. Metropolitan abolitionists formulated geogra-<br />
phies of [[empire]] that located formerly enslaved people in [[Canada]] along with<br />
“black” subjects in other regions, ranging from the West Indies to East India. More<br />
importantly, self-emancipated people from the [[United]] [[States]] living in [[Canada]]<br />
identified with emancipated West [[Indian]]s in articulating their “belonging” as<br />
[[British]] colonial subjects. This conceptual connection suggests the significance of<br />
[[Africa]]n diasporic identity for formerly enslaved U.S. [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns’ forma-<br />
tion of self. The powerful symbolism of West [[Indian]] emancipation in [[British]] polit-</p>

<p>ical discourse further enhanced its usefulness as a discursive tool.<br />
Black refugees’ association with emancipated West [[Indian]]s should be contex-<br />
tualized within the complex layers of political and diplomatic relations that shaped<br />
the mid-19th-century [[Atlantic]] World. This era saw an increased divergence of state<br />
policies regarding [[slavery]], which inspired many [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns in bondage to<br />
view enslavement as contingent upon the state or nation in which they resided,<br />
resulting in flights to “free” territory, in this case Upper [[Canada]]. However, mov-<br />
ing to a “free” space did not guarantee one’s protection from legal proceedings ini-<br />
tiated from across the border to regain lost “[[property]].” Self-emancipated people’s<br />
fashioning of a [[British]] identity was meant not only to express their appreciation of<br />
freedom on [[British]] soil, but also to secure their tenuous freedom from the inter-<br />
loping U.S. slave power. In this sense the fugitives’ [[British]] identity did not signal<br />
a complete break from enslavement in the [[United]] [[States]], but instead reflected their<br />
closeness to it, conditioned by a bilateral [[treaty]] system that inherently unsettled<br />
the national border between freedom and [[slavery]].<br />
In such precarious conditions of freedom, the presence of already emancipat-<br />
ed [[Africa]]n-descended people evoked particular diasporic politics, leading to the<br />
creation of the “[[British]] Negro.” This identity signified [[government]]-secured<br />
freedom and social and political advancement as free subjects. Self-emancipated<br />
people’s diasporic strategy represented an effort to exploit the [[British]] Empire’s<br />
redefined relationship to [[slavery]] and its reframed self-image as a [[white]] ruler and<br />
protector of “freed” darker peoples, a dynamic that was racially inequitable in its<br />
own distinctive ways. Seeking to make the most of what [[British]] freedom could<br />
offer, self-emancipated [[Africa]]n [[America]]ns from the [[United]] [[States]] physically and<br />
intellectually maneuvered their way through the new political and economic geog-<br />
raphies of the [[Atlantic]] World.</p>
