<p>[[Canada]]’s colonial objectives have always been to clear the lands for settlement 
and development by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>After signing peace [[treaties]] in the [[1700]]s, clearing the lands meant laws 
offering bounties on the heads of Mi’kmaw men, women and [[child]]ren. In the [[1800]]s,
clearing the lands meant ethnic cleansing on the Prairies - laws, policies and 
practices that confined native peoples to reserves</p>
<p>and gave them insufficient rations to survive. In the [[1900]]s, clearing the lands 
meant the theft of thousands of native [[child]]ren to be forced into residential 
schools where thousands died from abuse, torture and starvation. In the [[2000]]s 
clearing the lands means the mass [[incarceration]] of [[Indigenous]] peoples in [[prison]]s
paving the way for the extractive industry.</p>
<p>The over[[incarceration]] of [[Indigenous]] peoples in federal, provincial and 
territorial [[prison]]s in [[Canada]] today is nothing short of genocide.</p>
<p>On Jan. 21, [[2020]], Dr. Ivan Zinger, who heads the Office of the Correctional 
Investigator, issued an urgent statement about the rates of [[Indigenous]] peoples 
in federal [[prison]]s being at historic highs. While [[Indigenous]] peoples only make 
up five per cent of the [[Canadian]] population, they represent more than 30 per 
cent of those in federal [[prison]]s. Those statistics are even worse for [[Indigenous]]
women who now make up 42 per cent of the [[prison]] population. A Statistics [[Canada]] 
report released in [[2018]] shows that almost half of all youth in corrections are 
[[Indigenous]] as well. This is all happening at a time when [[incarceration]] rates for
the rest of [[Canada]] continue to decline. Why is this happening? Zinger states 
that federal corrections is “impervious to change” - a well-founded conclusion 
given the decades of commissions, inquiries and reports highlighting both [[racism]]
in the justice system and the devastating impact it has on [[Indigenous]] peoples.</p>
<p>In [[1989]], Chief Justice Thomas Hickman issued the final report of the Royal 
Commission on the [[Donald]] Marshall, Jr., Prosecution (Marshall Inquiry). [[Donald]] 
Marshall was a Mi’kmaw man from Nova Scotia who had been wrongly targeted by 
police and convicted of murder, spending 11 years in [[prison]]. The Marshall 
Inquiry found that the criminal justice system had failed Marshall “at virtually
every turn” due “to the fact that [[Donald]] Marshall Jr., is a [[Native]].” The report 
provided numerous recommendations to ensure more equitable [[treatment]] of native 
peoples in the future.</p>
<p>A decade later, the [[Aboriginal]] Justice Inquiry of [[Manitoba]] released its report 
in relation to the</p>
<p>murder of Helen Betty Osborne whose assailants had not been brought to justice; 
and John Joseph Harper, an unarmed native politician shot dead by [[Winnipeg]] 
police. Murray Sinclair, co-commissioner for the justice inquiry and chair of 
the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, made similar findings to the Marshall 
Inquiry: “[t]he justice system has failed [[Manitoba]]’s [[Aboriginal]] people on a 
massive scale.” His report also made numerous recommendations in relation to 
addressing [[racism]] and discrimination against [[Indigenous]] peoples in the justice 
system and beyond.</p>
<p>In [[2004]], the [[Saskatchewan]] Commission on First Nations and Metis Peoples and 
Justice Reform found that [[racism]] was a major issue in police forces in their 
dealings with native peoples. This came on the heels of the Commission of 
Inquiry into Matters Relating to the Death of Neil Stone[[child]], also in [[2004]]. 
This was an inquiry that investigated “Starlight Tours,” the arbitrary detention
of native peoples by police who are driven out of town to freeze to [[death]] at 
night. Both reports offered recommendations, but like the other reports, most 
were largely ignored.</p>
<p>In [[2007]] came the Ipperwash Inquiry in [[Ontario]] and most recently, in [[2019]] came 
the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing [[Indigenous]] 
Women and Girls, which found [[Canada]] guilty of both historic and ongoing 
genocide. [[Racism]] in the justice system is a common theme in all of these reports
and the Office of the Correctional Investigator has been raising the alarm for 
the over[[incarceration]] of [[Indigenous]] people for two decades.</p>
<p>The statistics clearly show a steady rise in [[Indigenous]] [[incarceration]] from 17.5 
per cent in [[2000]] to 30 per cent in [[2020]]. But these represent the national 
statistics and, like rates of [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women and girls, 
and [[Indigenous]] [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care, the provincial rates can be double the 
national rates.</p>
<p>In [[Manitoba]], more than 80 per cent of [[prison]]ers are [[Indigenous]] — the same 
province where 50 per cent of all women [[murdered]] and [[missing]] are [[Indigenous]] and 
90 per cent of all [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care are [[Indigenous]]. In [[Saskatchewan]], 76 
per cent of [[prison]]ers were [[Indigenous]], the same province which has more than 55 
per cent of women [[murdered]] and [[missing]] as [[Indigenous]] and 85 per cent of [[child]]ren
in [[foster]] care are [[Indigenous]]. We also know that more than two-thirds of 
[[Indigenous]] [[prison]]ers have been impacted by the [[foster]] care system. This is 
exactly the kind of colonial legacy that the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] in R. v. 
Gladue [[[1999]]] 1 S.C.R. 688 and R. v. Ipeelee [[2012]] SCC 13 cases meant to address 
when they instructed judges to find alternatives to [[prison]] for [[Indigenous]] 
peoples. Is no one listening?</p>
<p>From the evidence, it is clear we have a direct pipeline from [[foster]] care to 
[[prison]] that seems to clear the way for pipelines on native territories. What the
statistics don’t show is the [[history]] of thenRCMP and other police forces as an 
integral part of colonial settlement and development policies that have created 
this current crisis.</p>
<p>From the RCMP’s Project Sitka to its massive military-style operation on 
Wet’suwet’en territory right now, native lands continue to be cleared by 
[[Canada]]’s laws, policies, practices, actions and omissions. The over[[incarceration]]
rates will continue to increase unless we address these genocidal policies once 
and for all.</p>
<p>While I agree with Zinger’s call for “bold and urgent action,” cultural 
programming and Indigenizing the [[prison]] will not get us there. We must confront 
[[racism]] against [[Indigenous]] peoples head on and prevent [[incarceration]] in the first
place. This means addressing [[racism]] in federal and provincial laws and policies,
as well as rampant [[racism]] in policing. In the meantime, we must begin the urgent
process of decarceration for [[Indigenous]] women and [[child]]ren; [[Indigenous]] peoples 
with [[mental]] [[health]] issues; and [[Indigenous]] men languishing in [[prison]]s for little 
more than navigating [[poverty]].</p>
