<p>Last week, El Salvador’s [[government]] <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/[[bitcoin]]-now-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-first-nation-to-adopt-cryptocurrency/">passed a law</a> to accept [[bitcoin]] as legal tender alongside the US dollar. The country receives $6 billion in remittances per year—nearly a quarter of its gross domestic product—and the hope is that [[bitcoin]]’s lower transaction costs could boost that amount by a few percentage points.</p>
<p>The move was first proposed by the country’s president, Nayib Bukele, who said he hoped that in addition to facilitating lower remittance fees, the [[bitcoin]] plan would attract investment and provide an avenue for savings for residents, about 70 percent of whom are unbanked. (What Bukele didn’t say, but what Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-17/world-s-biggest-[[bitcoin]]-[[experiment]]-is-a-surf-town-in-el-salvador">reported</a>, is that he and members of his political party have owned [[bitcoin]] for years.)</p>
<p>Adding the cryptocurrency to the roster isn’t a simple task, though, and the new law gives the country just three months to roll the plan out nationwide. No country has ever used [[bitcoin]] or any other cryptocurrency as legal tender, and challenges abound. To address those concerns, El Salvador turned to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for assistance; the latter is currently considering a $1.3 billion <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-el-salvador-economy-exclusive/exclusive-el-salvador-seeks-imf-funding-sees-[[gold]]en-opportunity-for-economy-says-finance-minister-idUSKBN2AW1GV">financing request</a> from the country.</p>
<p>The [[IMF]] offered a guarded assessment of El Salvador’s [[bitcoin]] move, with spokesperson Gerry Rice saying at a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/imf-sees-legal-economic-issues-with-el-salvador-[[bitcoin]]-move-2021-06-10/">press briefing</a>, “Adoption of [[bitcoin]] as legal tender raises a number of macroeconomic, financial, and legal issues that require very careful analysis.” </p>
<p>The World Bank was less generous. “We are committed to helping El Salvador in numerous ways, including for currency transparency and regulatory processes,” a World Bank spokesperson told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/el-salvador-keep-dollar-legal-tender-seeks-world-bank-help-with-[[bitcoin]]-2021-06-16/">[[Reuters]]</a>. “While the [[government]] did approach us for assistance on [[bitcoin]], this is not something the World Bank can support given the environ[[mental]] and transparency shortcomings.”</p>
<p>In other words, [[bitcoin]]’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/05/private-equity-firm-revives-zombie-fossil-fuel-power-plant-to-mine-[[bitcoin]]/">energy demands</a> and its ease of use in money laundering, tax evasion, and other illegal schemes makes the cryptocurrency a no-go in the eyes of the World Bank.</p>
<h2>Technical challenges</h2>
<p>There are other reasons the World Bank and the [[IMF]] may be skeptical of El Salvador’s bid to use [[bitcoin]]. The technical challenges aren’t insignificant. For one, [[bitcoin]]’s price relative to the dollar has been highly volatile. How do you price a dozen eggs in [[bitcoin]] if the price of [[bitcoin]] [[flu]]ctuates 10 percent in a few hours? Perhaps the answer is that you don’t. In the “[[Bitcoin]] Beach” of El Zonte, El Salvador, where [[bitcoin]] use is relatively widespread, merchants <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-17/world-s-biggest-[[bitcoin]]-[[experiment]]-is-a-surf-town-in-el-salvador">still price their goods in dollars</a>, and the exchange rate is set at the time of purchase. That approach <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/06/12/el-salvador-[[bitcoin]]-volcano-faq/">appears</a> to be what the El Salvadoran [[government]] is taking, but it treats [[bitcoin]] more as a token than a true currency. </p>
<p>Second, [[bitcoin]] transactions can be notoriously slow. Each must be verified by miners, and miners only process blocks of transactions, not individual ones. So for a purchase in [[bitcoin]] to be confirmed, both parties have to wait for the block to be completed. Currently, one block takes about 10 minutes to be added to the [[blockchain]], though <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/06/11/[[bitcoin]]-beach-el-salvador-glimpse-cryptocurrency-economy/7651287002/">in El Zonte</a>, one merchant said transactions are confirmed in her local app in about two minutes. Various projects are working to improve the transaction speed, but they’re not part of [[bitcoin]] proper yet.</p>
<p>Lastly, while [[bitcoin]] transactions could be inexpensive or even free, they do tend to have a fee attached to them. Fees aren’t required, but they do entice miners to verify a transaction. Plus, should Salvadorans want to exchange their [[bitcoin]] for dollars, there are charges associated with that, too. So while the move could save on remittance fees, which run about 3 percent, the system won’t be costless.</p>
<p>El Salvador could still pull off the move without help from the World Bank or the [[IMF]], but it will be that much more challenging. And the clock is ticking. Unless businesses don’t have access to the technology required, they’ll have to accept [[bitcoin]] by [[September]] 7, 2021.</p>
