<p>*This article was originally published in The [[Lawyer]]'s Daily on Jan.30, [[2019]].</p>
<p>For decades, federal and provincial [[government]]s, through their local, regional 
and national police agencies and court systems, have arrested, charged and 
im[[prison]]ed thousands of First Nations people for engaging in the cannabis [[trade]].
Many had hoped that Prime Minister Justin [[[[Trudeau]]]]’s stated commitment to 
renewing the relationship with [[Indigenous]] peoples and his desire to legalize 
cannabis would help address many issues, one of which being the crisis-level 
over-[[incarceration]] of [[Indigenous]] peoples.</p>
<p>Despite legalization of cannabis in [[2018]], [[[[Trudeau]]]]’s Liberal [[government]] has not 
yet seen fit to provide relief for [[Indigenous]] peoples languishing in [[prison]]s for
cannabis-related offences. This is disappointing on two fronts: the first being 
that [[[[Trudeau]]]] has not kept his promises to [[Indigenous]] peoples; and second, that 
the first ever female [[Indigenous]] Justice minister didn’t take steps to get 
[[Indigenous]] peoples out of [[prison]].</p>
<p>We know that the over-[[incarceration]] of [[Indigenous]] peoples is a real crisis — one
that continues to grow without abatement. Despite being only five per cent of 
the population in [[Canada]], they represent more than 27 per cent of those in 
federal [[prison]]s. [[Indigenous]] women make up a staggering 43 per cent and 
[[Indigenous]] youth are now over 46 per cent of admissions to youth corrections.</p>
<p>Yet, even these statistics don’t show the whole picture. The provincial 
[[incarceration]] rates, especially in the Prairies, are astounding. Provincial 
[[prison]]s can be as high as 80 per cent [[Indigenous]] peoples and for [[Indigenous]] 
girls in [[Saskatchewan]], that rate is an unbelievable 98 per cent. We also know 
that more than half of all drug offences in [[2016]] were cannabis-related (58 per 
cent) and the majority of the charges were for possession. To say that we have a
real [[incarceration]] crisis is an understatement, but the limited cannabis 
legalization scheme, which does not substantively address over-[[incarceration]] of 
[[Indigenous]] peoples, is yet another broken promise.</p>
<p>While a handful of First Nation businesses have been specifically “permitted” to
engage in this new [[trade]], the majority are under a very real risk of legal 
sanctions — both as individuals and as First Nations — who assert their 
jurisdiction in this area. It is a cruel colonial irony that the very same 
people who have been im[[prison]]ed for their role in the cannabis [[trade]] — First 
Nations peoples — are now largely prohibited from engaging in the [[trade]] without 
permission from provincial [[government]]s.</p>
<p>Neither the federal nor provincial [[government]]s engaged in nation-to-nation 
dialogue with First Nations over how to best bring federal, provincial and First
Nation laws into harmony in relation to cannabis. Despite the many calls from 
First Nations for collaboration, First Nations were left out of the legislative 
drafting process and any good faith attempt to provide a trilateral, good faith 
path forward.</p>
<p>In [[May]] [[2018]], prior to the legalization of cannabis, the Standing Senate 
Committee on [[Aboriginal]] peoples released a report on Bill C-45 An Act Respecting
Cannabis and to Amend the Controlled [[Drugs]] and Substances Act, the Criminal Code
and Other Acts, which noted a real lack of “meaningful consultation” with 
[[Indigenous]] peoples and recommended that legalization be delayed for one year. 
The Standing Senate Committee recommended that [[Canada]] use the year to engage in 
negotiations with First Nations about tax collection and revenue sharing on 
reserves, recognition of the right of First Nations to enact their own 
legislation and funding for substance abuse and healing centres.</p>
<p>They further recommended that no less than 20 per cent of all cannabis 
production licences be issued to First Nations. This would have provided 
sufficient time for First Nations to draft their own laws, rules and regulations
and develop their own business policies and public safety protocols. While the 
Ministers of Health and [[Indigenous]] Services penned a letter to Senate claiming 
that their [[government]] “respects the jurisdiction of [[Indigenous]] communities”, 
Justice [[Canada]] officials previously clarified in Senate hearings that their 
position is that First Nations cannot enact by-laws in relation to cannabis on 
reserve and that provincial laws would apply. The federal [[government]] can’t have 
it both ways.</p>
<p>Incredibly, [[[[Trudeau]]]] has missed yet another opportunity to engage with First 
Nations on a nation-to-nation basis and decided to forge ahead on cannabis 
legislation without properly engaging with First Nations or meaningfully 
considering their inherent [[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights to pass their own laws. 
Instead, the federal [[government]] assumes provincial jurisdiction setting the 
stage for the legislated exclusion of First Nations and conflict on the ground.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time the [[government]] of the day has blockaded First Nations 
from engaging in their own business and [[trade]] endeavours to support their 
communities. It wasn’t that long ago that the Conservative [[government]] under 
former Prime Minister Stephen Harper enacted Bill C-10 An Act to amend the 
Criminal Code (trafficking in contraband [[tobacco]]) to create the new offence of 
trafficking in contraband [[tobacco]] and prescribed minimum mandatory sentences for
repeat offenders.</p>
<p>It was very clear that the bill was intended to target First Nations and their 
long practice of growing, manufacturing and trading in [[tobacco]] despite their 
inherent, [[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights to do so. The RCMP defined contraband 
[[tobacco]] as product that is primarily manufactured on First Nations reserves. 
This bill effectively acted as a legal blockade attempting to criminalize First 
Nations for engaging in their own traditional economies — an economy not even 
known to [[Europe]]ans prior to contact.</p>
<p>Settler [[government]]s have long engaged in the colonization of Turtle Island 
through the theft of First Nations lands and resources, but also through the 
appropriation of their lucrative [[trade]] practices, products and routes. The 
criminalization of the [[tobacco]] [[trade]] for First Nations went hand in hand with 
the transfer of control and benefit from [[tobacco]] to settler [[government]]s. It 
looks like [[Canada]] is doing the same thing to First Nations with regards to the 
cannabis [[trade]].</p>

<p>While it may or may not have been grown, manufactured and [[trade]]d traditionally, 
there is no doubt that this is the modern evolution of the right to [[trade]] as 
outlined in so many Supreme Court of [[Canada]] cases like the Van der Peet trilogy 
and the Sappier and Gray cases. First Nations are not limited to economic 
practices of pre-contact times or be “frozen in time.” Yet, that is exactly what
seems to be happening with the cannabis [[trade]].</p>
<p>In fact, it looks like those that are first in line to profit from this new 
legal [[trade]] are the very politicians and police officers that once fought so 
hard to im[[prison]] First Nations for trading in [[tobacco]] and now cannabis. Those 
previously engaged in [[tobacco]] and drug enforcement have an unfair advantage of 
knowing all the confidential intelligence on the drug [[trade]] and its key players,
as well as where and when to sell product and to whom. On top of this, former 
cops have connections all over the country, and that alone is an incredible form
of advantage and means of intimidating the so-called competition.</p>
<p>This gross injustice is now compounded by the fact that only certain businesses 
will be granted licences and the majority of those licences do not include First
Nations or their businesses. According to the federal [[government]]’s report to 
Senate, there are only 5 [[Indigenous]] producers out of the 105 in [[Canada]] — a far 
cry from the minimum 20 per cent recommended by Senate.</p>
<p>As the most impoverished communities in [[Canada]], First Nations have incredible 
social pressures on them to find ways to provide for their communities in a 
legally and politically hostile context. Federal and provincial [[government]]s have
created legal blockades around most First Nation traditional economies like 
hunting, fishing and gathering. They have left First Nations with few 
alternatives.</p>
<p>If [[[[Trudeau]]]] thinks that First Nations will simply shrug their shoulders and move 
along to a different economic opportunity, he is sadly mistaken. Many First 
Nations are invested in this [[trade]] and will defend their legal right to do so 
with or without provincial approval. The ability of the police to enforce 
federal or provincial laws in this regard will be highly suspect given their 
former colleagues’ involvement in the [[trade]]. Would the police be upholding the 
law or protecting the thin blue line’s new income stream?</p>
<p>All of this pending conflict — and there will be conflict — could have been 
avoided had [[[[Trudeau]]]] practised what he promised and engaged with First Nations on
a nation to nation basis and respected First Nation rights. It’s never too late 
to act, but with an election just around the [[corn]]er — it is unlikely [[[[Trudeau]]]] 
will rock the boat for all those former cops and Liberal politicians who now 
stand to make millions from cannabis.</p>
