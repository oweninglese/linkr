<p>[[Ireland]] was central to [[Britain]]'s first colonial expansion and its</p>
<p>techniques were honed in its expanded colonization around
the world, including in [[Canada]]. The common features include
control over land and resources and subjugation of [[Indigenous]]
peoples through enforced assimilation. [[Britain]] wanted [[Ireland]]
and [[Canada]] for military strategic purposes, economic profit, and
political power. [[Britain]] forced its way onto both lands through
methods that included forced relocations of [[Indigenous]] peoples
and legislating assimilation through penal laws in [[Ireland]] and</p>
<p>the [[Indian]] Act in [[Canada]]. [[Britain]]'s "divide and rule policy,"
cultural and spiritual subjugation, and the use of planted settlers
were employed in both [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]]. The similarities in
both places are identified as are the distinctions due to geography</p>
<p>and timing. The role that complexities play within [[Indigenous]]</p>
<p>societies is identified. The common and differing forms of
resistance and resilience of the [[Irish]] and various [[Indigenous]]</p>
<p>nations in [[Canada]] are also identified.</p>

Majesty's dominions, on which the sun never sets."</p>
<p>This article explores the nature of the model of [[British]] [[colonialism]] in
[[Ireland]] and [[Canada]] by addressing two questions: What were the key compo-</p>
<p>nents or principles of the [[British]] colonial model developed in [[Ireland]]? How
was it applied in [[Ireland]] to native [[Irish]] peoples and then honed and applied
to [[Indigenous]] peoples in [[Canada]]? This article considers the creation of the
[[British]] colonial model in [[Ireland]] and its application in [[Canada]], highlighting
some of its central tenets, including [[Britain]]'s divide and rule policy, control</p>
<p>over land, religious and cultural subjugation, use of the Penal Laws and the
[[Indian]] Act, and economic and political exploitation.
BRITISH COLONIALISM IN IRELAND</p>
<p>The [[British]] colonial model was designed and perfected in [[Ireland]] a
exported to [[Britain]]'s other colonies.4 The conflict resulting from</p>
<p>[[colonialism]] on the island of [[Ireland]] is well over 900 years, since the</p>
<p>invasion of the island in 1179. In the [[1690]] Battle of the Boyne, Ire
Catholic elites were defeated and the Penal Laws were introduced t</p>
<p>land.5 The Penal Laws gave a privileged position to the Anglican Chu</p>
<p>forbade Catholics and Protestant Dissenters from owning land, ed</p>
<p>and raising their [[child]]ren as Catholics, Presbyterians, or Methodists,</p>
<p>ing public office. For its colonial objectives to prevent [[French]] and</p>
<p>expansion,6 the English monarchy found the island of [[Ireland]] stra
very important, economically, militarily, and politically.</p>

<p>through the Gaels (native [[Irish]]) clan based system and the Breh</p>
<p>system. These systems survived even though they were altered thr</p>

lowland [[Scottish]] mercenaries and [[plantation]]s in Ulster in the seve</p>
<p>century, eroded the Gael's cultural, legal, socioeconomic, and politic
tures on the island.9</p>
<p>The lowland settlers sent to Ulster included various Protestant</p>

denominations, most prevalently [[Scottish]] Presbyterians, Church of England,</p>
<p>and Methodists who began settling in support of the [[plantation]] economy in
the century.10 The division of religious faiths and identification continued</p>
<p>well after the [[1603]] Ulster Plantation. The [[British]] planted Ulster with lowlanders with a view to repress rebel Gaelic forces and impose English culture</p>
<p>and language in the region.11 The [[British]] Ulster Plantation granted land to
[[Scottish]] Calvinist settlers who displaced native Catholics from their land.12
These settlers rarely intermarried with the native [[Irish]] and they lived as seg-</p>
<p>regated communities for centuries.13 [[Ireland]] became a laboratory to create
the imperial model and the ethnoreligious divisive formula of conquest that</p>
<p>would be exported overseas.</p>
<p>[[British]] dominance was enforced through the Penal Laws, which
regulated the status of [[Roma]]n Catholics.14 The Penal Laws comprehensively discriminated against Catholics who were prohibited from holding
[[government]] office or commissions or entering the legal profession; this
was coupled with acts that prevented them from owning land and limited
their access to education and practice of the Catholic religion.15 These laws
divided the agrarian south dominated by [[Irish]] Catholics from the industrial
north dominated by Protestant elites and working class loyal to England.16</p>
<p>According to J .J. Lee, "the [[1692]] Penal Laws secured a dominant relationship that allowed the Protestant community to force most Catholics</p>
<p>outside the socio-economic and political system."17 Scholars debate as to
whether the oppression was ethnically or religiously based; however, the
distinctions between the [[Irish]] and the planted Protestants had remained
quite distinct ethnically. Some English settlers intermarried with the local
Gaels and became more [[Irish]] than the [[Irish]] themselves.18
[[Native]] Inferiority</p>
<p>[[Ireland]]'s Gaelic identities and traditions remained intact throughout the
Viking and Norman invasions. The Celtic language and Catholic Christian
religion were not treated as inferior or barbaric, yet, through the subsequent</p>
<p>[[British]] invasions, they were increasingly affected by Protestant hegemony
that led to segregation along language, religion, class, ethnicity, and culture;</p>
<p>this became endemic after [[1500]]. 19 [[Irish]] Gaelic culture began to erode with</p>
<p>the abolition of the Gaelic Brehon law that had ensured the native people s
equality.20 The natives were treated as racially inferior. The [[1649]] [[warfare]]
by Cromwellian soldiers culminated in acts of genocide against [[Irish]] Gaels</p>

with the liquidation of the inhabitants of Drogheda and Dundalk, with
Cromwell giving them the choice of "to hell or to Connacht."21</p>
<p>The colonizers stance on the ethnic cleansing in [[Ireland]] can be understood from the message of [[King]] James I to Cromwell, "Plant [[Ireland]]
with Puritans and root out the Papists and then secure it."22 When the
Ulster planters were imposed, they saw the Gaelic populace as culturally,
religiously, and socioeconomically inferior, and they developed a siege men-</p>
<p>tality in response. The [[1641]] and [[1689]] massacres of local Protestant settlers
were led by the native Gaels trying to resist [[British]] imperialism.23 The Ulster</p>
<p>[[plantation]] itself is a narrative of [[violence]], which led to the ascendancy and</p>
<p>victory of the Orangemen after the [[1690]] Battle of the Boyne.24 Theobald
Wolf Tone further strengthened Protestant domination through the [[British]]
force of arms against the subsequent [[1798]] [[United]] [[Irish]]men [[rebellion]] that he
led.</p>
<p>The island became more segregated and divided, which continued
through the creation of the Gaelic Athletic Association, the [[Irish]] language</p>
<p>revival, and the [[Irish]] Volunteers led by Eoin MacNeil in response to the
[[1912]] emergence of the Ulster Volunteer Force to resist home rule for [[Ireland]]. With the signing of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant, in [[1912]]
in Belfast,25 the Protestant bourgeoisie were trying to prevent home rule and</p>
<p>a class [[alliance]] between working class Protestants and Catholics.
Even today, both communities contest political and cultural issues as
they live in enclaves under a sense of siege where the past and present have</p>
<p>become fused into one.26 The contemporary conflict between Protestant</p>
<p>Unionist Loyalists (PUL) and Catholic Nationalist Republicans (CNR) in
[[North]]ern [[Ireland]] inherits this colonial legacy from [[Britain]]'s divide and rule</p>
<p>policy that sought to keep both ethnic groups separated.27 The PUL community celebrates the marching season on 12 [[July]] and 12 [[August]] while the</p>
<p>CNR community perceives the marches as triumphalism rather than as a
PUL expression of culture.28
While the old English and the Anglo-[[Irish]] settlers intermarried with
the natives before the onset of the [[1603]] Plantation of Ulster, from the
seventeenth century onward, the impact of [[British]] colonizers in Ulster on
the native [[Irish]] began to escalate.29 The [[British]] sovereigns force was felt
as its legal, economic, and political systems; Protestantism substantially
affected the development of [[Irish]] nationalism and [[Irish]] political, cultural,
and economic systems.30 [[British]] imperialism was more than having political</p>

control on the island or extracting economic benefits; it was intended to
change [[Irish]] beliefs, traditions, and practices to conform to English values
and practices and bring the natives into line with [[Britain]]'s way of thinking.31</p>
<p>However, there was resistance to the [[1800]] [[British]]-[[Ireland]] Act of Union.
Within the [[Irish]] people, [[Irish]] nationalism became fused with Catholicism
as the [[Irish]] struggled to create a unified [[Ireland]] free from England.32
Religion</p>
<p>The [[British]] colonial power also used its own fusion of political and religious</p>
<p>leadership as a tool of oppression in [[Ireland]].33 The Gaelic tradition was
under attack with the 1 537 Protestant reformation and the arrival of new</p>
<p>English settlers who became engaged in religious, political, and socioeconomic developments in [[Ireland]].34 [[British]] policy outlawed all Catholic beliefs</p>
<p>and practices and attempted to replace them with the Anglican Church of
[[Ireland]].35 The [[Irish]] resisted by having outlawed priests give mass in the
fields; Catholicism was a symbol of their identity and a means of political
resistance to [[British]] policy.36</p>
<p>Apartheid Laws</p>
<p>This [[Irish]] Catholic homogenous identity collectivized the [[Irish]] and was
further strengthened in reaction to the Penal Laws, which discriminated
against the native [[Irish]], culturally, economically, politically, and religiously.37</p>
<p>The English usurper to the crown, William of Orange, instituted Penal Laws</p>
<p>from [[1695]]-[[1829]] to bar Catholics from practicing their religion, owning
land, speaking the Gaelic language, bringing their [[child]]ren up as Catholics,
running for [[government]] offices, and voting.38 The 'Dissenting or apartheid</p>
<p>Penal Laws' applied equally to Catholics, Methodists, and Presbyterians
who were perceived as social outcasts by the established Anglican Church.39</p>
<p>Sectarianism was used to keep the poor divided on religious lines.
Control of the Land</p>
<p>Religion, nationalism, and land issues fused together for Catholic peasants.
Land is tied into the spiritual and economic [[welfare]] of ethnic groups and
together these three issues became the centre of their identity.40 [[Ireland]]
witnessed a struggle between landlords and tenant farmers and eventually
between Catholic and Protestant tenant farmers due to the sectarian behavior of the Protestant bourgeoisie in Ulster.41</p>

[[British]] rule forced the Catholic peasants to replace their own subsistence farming with the potato cash crop to be sent to England, under
penalty of criminal convictions. Catholic tenant farmers relied almost solely</p>
<p>on the potato for subsistence. The mandatory use of the land for potatoes
depleted nutrients from the previously rich soils in [[Ireland]], leading to potato</p>
<p>rot and eventual mass starvations of the Catholic poor.42 The [[1845]]-[[1852]]
[[Irish]] potato famine was a period of disease, hunger, and emigration as over</p>
<p>one million people left [[Ireland]]'s shore in order to survive certain [[death]] by
starvation.43</p>
<p>The [[British]] absentee Protestant landlords kept the [[Irish]] tenant farmers
dependent on the potato while the centralized [[government]] structures failed</p>
<p>to address the potato famine and the population of [[Ireland]] decreased by
half.44 Some English politicians believed the suffering was the responsibility of the colonized people themselves rather than of those who governed
them.45 Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian tenant farmers were landless,</p>
<p>hungry, and, needless to say, angry. In [[1879]], the land question became a
central political issue. The [[Irish]] Land League and the [[Irish]] Parliamentary
Party led by Charles Stuart Parnell mobilized the [[Irish]] peasant farmers to
press for land reform as rural unrest spiked in [[Ireland]].46</p>
<p>Localized Nationalism</p>
<p>[[British]] policy sought to alter the [[Irish]] peoples nationalism, yet the [[Irish]]
people used their nationalist identity, intermingled with Catholicism, to resist the colonizer.47 The [[British]] imposed [[British]] [[parliament]]ary democracy in
[[Ireland]] with [[Irish]] M.P.s taking an oath of allegiance to the [[British]] monarch.48</p>
<p>During the nineteenth century, [[Irish]] nationalists refused to recognize
the Monarch, further driving a political and religious wedge between the
south and north of the island.49 The [[Irish]] democratic tradition evolved</p>
<p>into violent [[Irish]] Republicanism in the early twentieth century as [[Irish]]
Republicans launched an all-out war against [[Britain]].50 Thus, the question</p>
<p>of nationalism, and the relationship between Catholicism and [[Irish]]ness,
became salient in the nineteenth century with nonviolent and violent [[Irish]]
resistance movements.51</p>
<p>The [[British]] Empire profited from exploitation and cruelty in its colonies, beginning with [[Ireland]].52 [[Irish]] dissenters against the [[British]] presence</p>
<p>were arrested and prosecuted during the [[British]] colonization period. Sir
Roger Casement is one such victim. During the [[1916]] Rising, Casement,</p>

a diplomat and human rights activist involved in the [[Irish]] Republican
Brotherhood, was tried and executed for [[treason]]. Casements radical views</p>
<p>resulted from his observation of the colonial oppression of workers on
rubber [[plantation]]s not only in [[Ireland]] but also in the Congo, Brazil, and</p>
<p>[[Peru]].53 The leaders of the [[1916]] Rising were equally impacted by similar
views.54 With [[Ireland]] being the first [[British]] [[colony]], it is evident that [[Britain]]</p>
<p>developed its colonizing processes there and then continued with further</p>
<p>developed methods in other locations. One such location is the land now</p>
<p>called [[Canada]].</p>
<p>BRITISH COLONIALISM IN CANADA</p>
<p>In as early as the 1 500s, when [[Europe]]ans arrived to what is now C</p>
<p>there were multiple [[Indigenous]] nations living on the land. Howeve</p>
<p>terra nullis , [[Britain]] and [[France]] fought over the land as if it were em</p>
<p>could become theirs; they competed over [[alliance]]s with different In</p>
<p>nations to support their efforts at colonization.55 The Seven Ye
between the [[British]] and the [[French]], [[1754]]-[[1763]], led to [[Britain]] a
[[French]] controlled [[Canada]] and installing its rule in [[North]] [[America]]
the [[1763]] Royal Proclamation.*
Despite the end of some aspects of formal [[British]] colonial
[[Canada]], at the time of Confederation in [[1867]] through the BN
[[Canada]] remained part of the [[British]] Commonwealth as the [[Crown]]
of [[Canada]] (the [[Crown]]). [[Canada]] existed as a transplanted [[Britain]], wi</p>
<p>or no inclusion of [[Indigenous]] peoples in governance. The colonial g</p>
<p>ment s policies remain to this day, primarily through the self-pro</p>
<p>[[1876]] [[Indian]] Act . Some of the other components of the [[Crown]]s
over non-[[Indigenous]] [[Canada]] have ended; however, [[Indigenous]] pe
[[Canada]] remain colonized through the [[Crown]].57

consisted of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], Nova Scotia, and [[New]] [[Brunswick]], honored
the [[Crown]]s Proclamation by initiating a series of formal [[treaties]] across the</p>
<p>western areas of the land so that these [[Indian]] lands could become part of
the new Dominion rather than be absorbed into the [[United]] [[States]] through
Manifest Destiny.59
As the land is the key factor, the [[Crown]] envisioned the [[treaties]] as land</p>
<p>cession [[treaties]], which arguably removed [[Aboriginal]] title from the First</p>
<p>Nations' ancestral lands in [[Canada]].60 Early [[treaties]] were concerned with
military or economic relationships between [[Britain]] and its colonies. In the
process of [[colonialism]] in [[North]] [[America]], the settler state secured the territories by dispossessing the [[Aboriginal]] peoples from their ancestral lands.61</p>
<p>However, for reasons that are still open to a wide range of debate, the</p>
<p>new Dominion also began a simultaneous process of exerting complete
control over every aspect of [[Indian]]s lives and lands through its [[1876]] [[Indian]]</p>
<p>Act.61 Even with the use of modern "nation-to-nation" [[treaties]] through
Comprehensive Land Claims, the people are still "[[Indian]]" people, meaning
wards of the [[Canadian]] [[government]] under the confines of the [[Indian]] Act;
their relationships with [[Canada]] fall under [[Canada]]s Constitution ([[1982]]). 63
This calls the legitimacy of "nation-to-nation" relationships into question.</p>
<p>With a few exceptions through modern agreements, such as Sechelt and
Tswwassen First Nations who have debatable forms of self-governance over</p>
<p>their lands, the majority of First Nations in [[Canada]] fall wholly within the
paternalistic [[Indian]] Act.64</p>
<p>[[War]]fare, spatial displacement, and the assimilation of [[Indigenous]]
peoples into the colonized society were evident in [[Canada]].65 In [[colonialism]], "settlers carry [[sovereignty]] with them and found new political orders
in the spaces they colonialize."66 Before the late twentieth century, many
[[British]] colonized countries, including the [[Western]] democracies of [[Canada]],
the [[United]] [[States]] [[Australia]], and [[New]] [[Zealand]], undertook assimilating and
marginalizing policies to deal with [[Indigenous]] peoples.67 The [[government]]s
and colonizers resorted to policies including, "stripping [[Indigenous]] peoples
of their lands, restricting the practice of their traditional cultures, languages,</p>
<p>and religions, and under[[mining]] their institutions of self-[[government]]" to</p>
<p>assimilate [[Indigenous]] peoples so that they do not sustain themselves as
distinct cultures.68</p>

Removal of [[Indigenous]] People from Their Land ' Livelihoods , and Sustenance</p>
<p>Colonization transferred 99.64 percent of the land from [[Indigenous]] peoples</p>
<p>to the colonizers hands.69 Clearly, the [[British]] takeover of [[Indigenous]] lands
led to a loss of livelihood for the [[Indigenous]] nations.</p>
<p>Particularly in [[Western]] [[Canada]], starvation and mass infestations reduced the numbers of [[Indigenous]] people significantly, arguably for easier
access for the settlers to the land and its resources.70 [[British]] political colo-</p>
<p>nization and its [[child]], the Dominion of [[Canada]], took [[Indigenous]] land and
exploited resources such as minerals and timber for their own economic
interests.71 In [[Western]] [[Canada]], [[British]] colonization initially occurred economically through the world s first multinational [[company]]: the Hudson [[Bay]]</p>
<p>Company ([[HBC]]).72 Through the [[1670]] Charter between the [[Crown]] of
England and the Company, [[Britain]] assumed control and ownership of what
it called Rupertsland, which included, "almost a million and a half square
miles of western and northern [[Canada]], more than 40 percent of the modern
nation."73</p>
<p>Because the [[HBC]] was dependent on [[Indigenous]] people to supply
the profit-making furs, [[Indigenous]] groups like the Homeguard [[Indian]]s
around York Factory were initially treated as economic partners. The [[Cree]]</p>
<p>Homeguards and others acted as brokers with more-inland [[Indigenous]]
people and controlled who could do business with the Company.74
The various [[Indigenous]] groups in what is now [[Canada]] had a very different understanding of and relationships with the land than the [[British]].
Within the [[Indigenous]] worldview, everything is related and to be held in
balance, particularly the environment.75 For [[Indigenous]] peoples, the land
was attached to many aspects of life, and not just used for material gains.76</p>
<p>The [[Cree]] attached their [[Indigenous]] system of healing and medicine to the
land. The Ininews forest spirituality is reflected in their view of hunting
practices as holy and involving spiritual relationships, not as technical practices as imposed by the [[HBC]] regarding their caribou hunting.77</p>
<p>As the [[HBC]] and other colonizing forces grew, this balance was no
longer maintained. As [[Europe]]ans, primarily [[British]], expanded across the
land, [[Indigenous]] numbers decreased through the mass [[epidemic]]s, resultant
and forced starvation, and the loss of their food sources.78 [[Indigenous]] people
became reliant on [[British]] governing and economic forces for their survival. It
is for these reasons that the Numbered Treaties in the Prairie part of [[Western]]</p>
<p>[[Canada]] were signed.79</p>

The Treaties Between Nations Morphed into The [[1876]] [[Indian]] Act
While the stated intent of the numbered [[treaties]] in the Prairies was to come
to an agreement to share the land, it quickly became apparent that there were</p>
<p>dichotomously opposing interpretations of the [[treaties]]. While [[Indigenous]]
nations understood them to mean that the land was now being peacefully</p>
<p>shared, the [[Crown]] decided that it now had ownership of the lands and
could unilaterally decide its uses, which included making it available for
mass immigration from many areas of the world.80</p>
<p>This led to ever increasing needs for the lands that had been set aside
for [[Indian]] reserves. One response was to enact the [[1876]] [[Indian]] Act, which
gave unilateral control over [[Indian]]s to the [[Crown]]. This included deter[[mining]] who was and who was not recognized as status [[Indian]]s, non-status, and
Metis or Halfbreeds; deciding for [[Indigenous]] people who they could be and
where they could and could not live on reserves was similar to the evolution
of the Bantu of apartheid in [[South]] [[Africa]] where local people were forced to
live by the Afrikaner [[government]].81 The [[Crown]] determined that the answer</p>
<p>to the [[Indian]] Problem lay in assimilating them into [[Canada]].
[[British]] forms of [[government]] were based on individual leaders with political authority. All [[Indian]] forms of [[government]], such as the highly revered</p>
<p>Haudenosaunee, were outlawed through the [[Indian]] Act , which replaced
them with a generic chief and band council system that was uniformly
imposed across the land.82
Discriminatory Laws</p>
<p>The [[British]] and [[French]] colonizers profiled [[Indian]]s in [[North]] [[America]] as
savages or inferior races; the myth of the "noble savage" was used as a tool
to deny them equality and human rights while genocide served to eradicate</p>
<p>them.83 Discriminatory laws like the [[Indian]] Act ([[1876]]) gave the [[Canadian]]
[[government]] authority to try to assimilate [[Indian]]s into mainstream [[British]]formed [[Canada]]. [[Indigenous]] peoples were considered far too inferior in their
traditional ways to be accepted into [[British]]-determined [[Canadian]] society.84
In an effort to repress [[Indigenous]] peoples and prevent resistance, status</p>
<p>[[Indian]]s were only first allowed to vote in federal or provincial elections in</p>
<p>[[1961]]. Until [[1951]], they were not allowed to retain their identity as status
[[Indian]]s if they attended university or fought for [[Canada]]s Armed Forces.
[[Indian]]s were not allowed to gather in groups of more than three or four
to prevent political discussions or hire a lawyer to represent their political</p>

interests. In the prairies, some [[Indian]] agents illegitimately invoked the [[Indian]] Act to prevent [[Indian]]s from leaving their communities for any reason
without a signed pass.85
Residential Schools</p>
<p>Residential schools were used to colonize and destroy the culture of [[Aboriginal]] [[child]]ren from the late [[1800]]s until the [[1990]]s. This system was
designed to produce English-speaking [[Indian]]s who adopted the [[white]] men s
[[Canadian]]-[[British]] culture. To accomplish assimilation, the goal was to have
them think, act, and live like [[Canadian]] [[British]] subjects. This was most evident within the [[Indian]] Residential Schools (IRSs) where the stated purpose
was to wget the [[Indian]] out of the [[child]]." Attempts at education through day</p>
<p>schools had proved to be lacking since the [[child]]ren went home at night and</p>
<p>continued to speak with their families in their own languages and live by
their own ways.86</p>
<p>Children were removed from their families by force and by laying
criminal charges against parents if required. In [[1920]], the Deputy Minister</p>
<p>of [[Indian]] Affairs, Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott, wanted to get rid of the
[[Indian]] problem': "Our object is to continue until there is not a single [[Indian]]
in [[Canada]] that has not been absorbed into the body politic."87 At the peak of</p>
<p>the residential school system, the [[government]] funded eighty-three schools
to educate twenty to thirty percent of the native population in [[Canada]] and</p>
<p>the last of these institutions was closed in [[1996]] in [[Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]].88</p>
<p>The proportions in western [[Canada]] were most probably higher, and the
exact numbers are still not actually known due to poor record keeping.</p>
<p>In [[1906]], the [[Canadian]] Tuberculosis Association determined that almost seventy-five percent of 1RS students died before they reached the age
of eighteen due to insufficient [[health]] services; all were subjected to [[British]]
colonization indoctrination.89 Half of the [[Indian]] [[child]]ren received no higher
than grade six education at most through the residential schools90 and First</p>
<p>Nations students currently on reserve receive three to six thousand dollars
less funding each year than all other students.91 Statistics still reflect a grossly</p>
<p>disproportionate high school graduation rate for First Nations people: fortyfive percent compared to sixty-five percent for non-[[Indigenous]].92</p>
<p>With the vast majority of the students physically, sexually and emotionally abused, improperly fed, and often forced to labour throughout their</p>
<p>[[child]]hoods, the schools run by the Christian churches are now considered to</p>

be im[[prison]]ment centers for severely traumatized [[child]]ren. The 1RS system
was linked to [[poverty]], poor [[health]], [[mental]] illness, language loss, spiritual loss,</p>
<p>rape and sexual abuse, and cultural destruction that together was damaging
to [[Indigenous]] communities in [[Canada]] with lasting impacts today.93 Due to
these residential schools, [[Indigenous]] people across [[Canada]] have witnessed
an escalation in sexual abuse, alcoholism, depression, and the murder and
disappearance of young [[Aboriginal]] women.94 Culture shock, disorientation,
and confusion surrounded the survivors of the residential schools and made
them feel hopeless as well as resilient through their cultures.95</p>
<p>The transgenerational transmission of trauma to future generations
is inevitable from the [[Canadian]] [[Aboriginal]] peoples' colonized past.96 Parents' role in teaching their [[child]]ren about their culture and community is
denigrated and their language, as well as cultural pride, is lost. Ultimately,
intergenerational communications are also affected by this traumatic past.
As the schools closed, the [[child]]ren were literally transferred into the [[child]]
[[welfare]] system. This led to losses of [[child]]ren into non-[[Indigenous]] adoptions
and [[foster]] placements. Currently, there are more [[Indigenous]] [[child]]ren in the
care of [[child]] [[welfare]] than at the height of the IRSs.97</p>
<p>After 1RS survivors began to file lawsuits against the [[Canadian]] govern-</p>
<p>ment and the churches that ran the schools, the Supreme Court of [[Canada]]
opted to respond collectively with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC). For several years, the Commission heard testimony from survivors
and their families who were affected by the schools as well as some former
staff. The volumes of grief, despair, anger, and resiliency within the testimo-</p>
<p>nies led to the 94 Calls to Action, which specify in detail how the [[Canadian]]
[[government]] and society can begin work for reconciliation98.</p>
<p>Spiritual Colonization
Spiritual colonization permeated the society and was arguably the most destructive colonial force. The efforts at assimilation were targeted against all</p>
<p>aspects of [[Indigenous]] peoples' lives, including their languages, stories, and
spiritual practices. Prior to the governing forces of either [[Britain]] or [[France]],</p>
<p>Christian missionaries of all denominations arrived with the explorers and
they traveled into the communities in the first wave of settlers. They also</p>
<p>provided information about whether [[Indian]]s were actually human or not
and if they were deserving of being converted to Christianity.99 In the end,</p>
<p>they were deemed worthy of conversion, including forced conversion, but</p>

<p>The Art of [[Breaking]] People Downenous Peoples 27
were not human enough to warrant full recognition of their rights to their
own lands and sovereign nations.100
In [[Canada]], the [[British]] colonizers imposed Christianity through the [[Indian]] Acts outlawing of traditional practices under threat of im[[prison]]ment;
they also used genocidal means such as the residential schools where [[child]]ren</p>
<p>were reprogrammed.101 This resulted in many spiritual practices being kept</p>
<p>underground, taking place at night and far from the communities and the
watchful eyes of the [[Indian]] agents and the local churches. While these covert</p>
<p>practices have ensured the continuation of the original spiritualties, the
impact of the colonization of spirituality is still very evident today. Within
communities and even [[nuclear]] families, there are rifts between those who
practice Christianity and those who practice traditional forms of spirituality,</p>
<p>with some practicing both.
Spiritual colonization has also affected the transmission of knowledge.
[[Indigenous]] people state that their knowledge is found indivisibly within their</p>
<p>languages and their lands. While the transmission of knowledge through
language and stories was severely attacked, there were enough covert exchanges of information and practice of ceremonies to keep the knowledge
and ways alive and lead to the contemporary process of renaissance.102</p>
<p>The colonization process in [[Canada]] has had destabilizing effects on
[[Canadian]] [[Indigenous]] peoples.103 The [[British]] colonial model sought to
destroy people s relationship and connectivity to the land that is the basis of</p>
<p>every [[Indigenous]] persons spirituality in [[Canada]].104 For example, the Sayisi
Dene and the [[Cree]] approach to caribou hunting was radically altered due to
colonization, despite their maintenance of spiritual human-animal relationships and practices of "respect" to animals.105 The actual destruction of the</p>
<p>land, environment, and food sources in the past continues today through
ongoing oil and gas, mineral, and timber exploitation. Communities near
these resources are ecologically and socially affected, under-funded with
little to no resources, and facing great loss of life through resulting suicide.106</p>
<p>COMPARISONS: IRISH AND CANADIAN COLONIZATION
PROCESSES</p>
<p>There are obvious commonalities and also key distinctions within the</p>
<p>ish colonization processes that unfolded in [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]]. The Br
colonial model includes the common elements of divide and rule, con</p>
<p>of land, religious suppression, ethnocentrism, depoli ticization, and u</p>

force. The underlying principles of the different terms or constructs used for</p>
<p>[[Ireland]] and [[Canada]] are based on the same logic: a divide and rule strategy
through creation of apartheid laws that suppress and treat local people as
inferior. Some contend that divide and rule continues in [[Ireland]] with the
partition of the six counties in [[North]]ern [[Ireland]]. It continues in [[Canada]]
most obviously in [[Canada]]'s continuing determination of [[Indigenous]] identities - status versus non-status versus Metis - which then determines which
[[Indigenous]] rights the individual may or may not have, even dividing families
with these distinctions.</p>
<p>The primary goal has been the same: access to [[Indigenous]] lands for
their economic potential. The peoples of [[Indigenous]] lands are either used
as a means to access the lands potential - tenant farmers in [[Ireland]] and
guides and brokers in the fur [[trade]] in [[Canada]] - or removed to clear access
to more lands, as seen in (for example) forced emigration from [[Ireland]] in
the coffin ships and forced containment onto small reserves in [[Canada]] and</p>
<p>forced relocation to urban centres. Attempts to access [[Indigenous]] lands
and resources continue particularly in [[Canada]], as evidenced by the modern
[[treaty]] processes, as well as efforts at colonized-based resource extractions.107</p>
<p>[[Britain]] damaged the relationships between the [[Indigenous]] peoples and
the land, nature, and spirit world, as well as hampering the resiliency poten-</p>
<p>tial of the local populations.108 Biological and psychological damage was so
severe that historical intergenerational trauma affects the survivors and their</p>
<p>[[child]]ren's [[child]]ren. Healing and reconciliation have become a challenge in
the postcolonial [[Irish]] and [[Canadian]] contexts.109 In [[Ireland]], the 1[[998]] Good
Friday Agreement has decreased political and direct [[violence]]; however, the
social and economic stressors continue between the two groups in a liminal
type of negative peace.1 10 In [[Canada]], there are still multiple outstanding land</p>
<p>claims as well as conflict over resource development. First Nations [[child]]ren
are still severely underfunded, to the point of loss of life, and lacking both
basic and special needs services on reserve.111</p>
<p>Through economic and political control and cultural subjugation with</p>
<p>respect to the native peoples' languages, education, religious beliefs, and
practices, [[British]] [[colonialism]] has been destructive in both [[Ireland]] and [[Canada]]. According to the [[Canadian]] TRC, the [[Indian]] residential school system
has served as an element of [[Canada]]'s century-long [[Aboriginal]] policy that
was, "devised to destroy [[Aboriginal]] [[government]], to deny [[Aboriginal]] rights,
to terminate Treaties, and to assimilate [[Aboriginal]] people by damaging their</p>

<p>The Art of [[Breaking]] People Downenous Peoples 29
existence as a distinct socio-cultural entity."112</p>
<p>The TRC termed this process as cultural genocide: "the destruction of
those structures and practices that allow the group to continue as a group."1 13</p>
<p>The state s cultural genocidal activities were the destruction of the social and</p>
<p>political institutions of the [[Aboriginal]] peoples, including the forbiddance of
spiritual practices, seizure of land, forced displacement, restriction of move-</p>
<p>ment, banning of languages, persecution of spiritual leaders, and prevention
of the intergenerational transmission of cultural values and identity through
disrupting families.114</p>
<p>[[Canada]]s former Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an apology in
[[June]] [[2008]] that confirmed the intent of destruction of [[Indigenous]] culture:</p>
<p>"These objectives were based on the assumption [[Aboriginal]] cultures and
spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was
infamously said, 'to [[kill]] the [[Indian]] in the [[child]]/ Today, we recognize that
this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no
place in our country."115</p>
<p>In [[1997]], one hundred and fifty years after the Famine, [[Britain]] also
issued an apology: "remorse for [[Britain]] s failure to offer greater assistance."116</p>
<p>Former [[British]] Prime Minister Tony Blairs [[1997]] apology went a long way in
the healing process of the [[Irish]] nation and was critical to the success of the
1[[998]] Good Friday Agreement that ended thirty years of political strife and
[[violence]] in [[North]]ern [[Ireland]].117</p>
<p>According to the [[Canadian]] TRCs Calls to Action, reconciliation
through objective actions can heal and repair many social injustices faced</p>
<p>by the [[Aboriginal]] peoples in [[Canada]] and can address the lack of the
mainstream settler society s education and awareness regarding [[Indigenous]]
peoples, [[history]], and Treaties. The TRC makes it clear that reconciliation
and healing must address the religious, linguistic, and cultural consequences</p>
<p>of residential schools and the humiliation endured by [[Indigenous]] peoples.</p>
<p>[[Indigenous]] knowledge based relational justice and healing practices can
restore the independence of the [[Indigenous]] communities so that they can
again have a life of purpose.118</p>
<p>While there were official apologies to [[Irish]] people and [[Indigenous]]
peoples in [[Canada]], it is apparent that colonization continues and is not
limited to [[history]]. It has remained resilient and in existence.</p>

CONCLUSION? OR CONTINUING RESILIENCE AND
RE[[SIS]]TANCE?</p>
<p>Even with apologies and some acts towards reconciliation in both Irelan</p>
<p>and [[Canada]], there is clearly unfinished business required in order to m</p>
<p>beyond [[British]] colonization. Colonization in both places is not yet ov</p>
<p>which is why there is not an actual conclusion. The resistance and resilie
continues to this day.</p>
<p>In [[Ireland]], the resistance has morphed from violent conflict in Nort</p>
<p>ern [[Ireland]] to peaceful resistance within the governing structures of t</p>
<p>Good Friday Agreement. [[Irish]] language and culture is gaining strength a</p>
<p>prominence.119 In [[Canada]], [[Indigenous]] people continue resistance throug</p>
<p>mostly victorious court action for land claims and through cultural rene
with increasing use of [[Indigenous]] languages and cultural practices.120
[[British]] colonization has left its indelible mark on both [[Ireland]] and</p>
<p>[[Canada]]. Nonetheless, the [[Irish]] and [[Indigenous]] peoples of [[Canada]]s cultures
are revitalizing to the credit of their lasting connections with their unique
identities. [[British]] colonization has been devastating but it has not succeeded</p>
<p>in overpowering the [[Irish]] or [[Canadian]] [[Indigenous]] peoples.
