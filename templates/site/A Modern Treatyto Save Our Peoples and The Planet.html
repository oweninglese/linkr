<p>This blog is an excerpt of the speech that I gave at the Climate Tour with David
Suzuki and Stephen Lewis, on [[October]] 4, [[2019]] in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] at the 
University of [[Winnipeg]] on [[Treaty]] 1 territory. (Check against delivery).</p>
<p>Kwe n’in telusi Pam Palmater. It is an honour to be here on [[Indigenous]] territory
covered by [[Treaty]] one. Thanks to the elder for opening &amp; to UofW for hosting us.
Oct.4th important day to remember lives lost due to [[murdered]] and [[missing]] 
[[Indigenous]] women and girls.</p>
<p>We have a hard truth to face. We are in the middle of two major crises: [[Canada]] 
is [[kill]]ing our people and the planet and we are here to stop it!</p>
<p>The first crisis is that the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing 
[[Indigenous]] Women and Girls found that [[Canada]] has and continues to commit 
genocide against [[Indigenous]] peoples – specifically targeting [[Indigenous]] Women 
and Girls.</p>
<p>The second crisis is that [[Indigenous]] [[[[science]]]] and western [[[[science]]]] have both 
confirmed that we are headed for a massive [[climate]] disaster.</p>
<p>To say that we are in a crisis of epic proportions would be an understatement. 
We need to act now to end the genocide of [[Indigenous]] peoples &amp; stop the ecocide 
of the earth. Because we know that the pain of [[Indigenous]] peoples is the same 
pain felt by the planet. And the pain of this planet is felt first and foremost 
by [[Indigenous]] peoples.</p>
<p>Settler [[government]]s in [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]], [[Australia]], [[New]] [[Zealand]] and all
over the world have colonized [[Indigenous]] territories with horrific acts of 
[[violence]] to peoples and the earth. The colonizing [[mental]]ity pervades our 
governing systems and allows [[government]]s and corporations to treat people and 
the planet as resources to exploit - as though they were lifeless commodities. 
Extractive economies – now largely benefiting transnational corporations - have 
been authorized by [[government]]s land leave destruction in their wake.</p>
<p>We’ve seen tears from [[Indigenous]] mothers whose daughters have been [[murdered]] by 
the thousands. We’ve also seen the heartbreak of [[kill]]er whale mothers mourning 
the losses of their offspring who can’t survive in an oil tanker dominated 
eco-systems.</p>
<p>And if we, as First Nations and [[Canadian]]s, don’t act quickly - many more people,
plants and animals will die. We no longer have the time to debate politics – the
crisis in [[Canada]] is now a matter of life and [[death]] for all of us. It won’t be 
good enough in 50 years to look back and say we tried, we had the best 
intentions, or we gave it our best effort.</p>
<p>We either do or die.</p>
<p>And right now, [[Indigenous]] peoples are dying. Our planet is dying. But you all 
know this. We can no more deny the ecocide of [[climate]] change, than we can deny 
genocide of [[Indigenous]] peoples. The statistics, the [[research]] and the scientific 
evidence before our eyes is too overwhelming. Climate change is greatest threat 
to all life on earth – humans, plants and animals.</p>
<p>Who bears the disproportionate burden of environ[[mental]] destruction, water 
contamination and more pipelines? [[Indigenous]] peoples do. That is because 
genocide and ecocide go hand in hand. This earth has suffered a great assault, 
in part because of massive human rights violations to its caretakers – 
[[Indigenous]] peoples. Similarly, [[Indigenous]] peoples have suffered a great genocide
in part because of the [[violence]] committed against our lands, waters, and 
ecosystems on which we depend.</p>
<p>Our society’s economy has been constructed in a way which exploits ands abuses 
[[Indigenous]] women and the land with relative impunity. Well now, we all stand to 
pay the price of the impending [[climate]] disaster and corresponding the human 
disaster that will follow - all while large corporations reap the benefits.</p>
<p>In the end – we will all suffer – if there is no drinkable water, farmable land 
or pollinators.</p>
<p>What we need is a new [[treaty]] - a modern [[treaty]] that binds us all together - the 
people and the planet. A [[treaty]] that commits us to work together for the benefit
of all Nations of peoples and living beings without discrimination, [[racism]], 
sexism genocide or ecocide. A [[treaty]] that commits all people to heal our 
divisions so we can commit to protecting our collective futures.</p>
<p>We must remember that our collective futures includes the plants, animals, birds
,fish, and insect Nations. They too have as much right to live on this planet as
we do and if we have any hope of surviving, we’ll need every bee hive, every 
coral reef and every [[kill]]er whale pod to maintain our precious eco-systems.</p>
<p>This modern [[treaty]] can be a reality.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what we call it, whose idea it was, where it originated or 
whether we agree on all aspects of it. This new [[treaty]] is about combining social
justice and earth justice together to pave the way to a better future for all. 
The dual crises facing us requires that we do everything in our collective power
to save our planet.</p>
<p>This will require a societal [[revolution]] that goes beyond superficial changes and
the glacial pace at which [[government]]s operate. It will require that we change 
everything and that will mean we need to get uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We don’t need everyone for a [[revolution]] to save the planet. We don't have time 
to wait around until the genocide and [[climate]] change deniers are convinced. If 
we wait, it will be too late for us all.</p>
<p>Every single right we have ever gained – human rights, environ[[mental]] protections
or native rights – have been advanced by small numbers of people – sometimes 
only individuals pushing forward despite the odds. We can do this with all of 
you in this room. But we cant wait for all of you. We will forge ahead because 
we have to - its the only way to give [[Indigenous]] peoples and this planet a 
fighting chance.</p>
<p>Other people will join when they see our successes. There will always be 
genocide deniers &amp; [[climate]] change deniers, but we have an obligation to forge 
ahead anyway. If the lands are toxic from tar sands, and the water polluted from
[[mining]], none of our [[child]]ren will survive - whether they are [[Canadian]] or 
[[Indigenous]]. That’s why we need to work together.</p>
<p>Together, we not only have the power to stop these abuses, but we can return 
[[Canada]] to its original [[treaty]] vision. Every single one of you has the power to 
stand up for what is right and save not only yourselves, but all those who can’t
advocate on their own - for all of those whose voices that are not counted – the
bees, the whales, the trees and the tiniest insects.</p>
<p>None of you can do it alone and we don’t expect you to - the original [[treaty]] 
vision for [[Canada]] was premised on us working together to benefit from and 
protect the lands and waters which sustain us.
Our advantage and our strength is in our collectives.</p>
<p>[[Canada]] wouldn’t even exist without the [[treaty]] agreements between sovereign 
[[Indigenous]] Nations and the [[Crown]]. This original [[treaty]] vision was meant to 
protect the ecosystem on Turtle Island for as long as long as the grass grows, 
the rivers flow and sun shines.</p>
<p>We are faced with two global crises – genocide and ecocide.</p>
<p>We must use the spirit and intent of our original [[treaties]] to forge a new future
[[Canadian]]s – get out and vote in your system – use your numbers, your wealth, 
your in[[flu]]ence and your privilege to force the change. But don’t stop there – 
the pressure must continue in full force post election in all forums - in 
Parliamentary and Senate Committees, in where you spend you money (or don't), in
the media, in the boardroom, in your advocacy and at the [[United]] Nations.</p>
<p>[[Indigenous]] peoples will always be there on front lines, but we cant do it alone 
– we need you and you need us.</p>
<p>Our very lives depend on it.</p>
<p>We can protect the lands and waters and we can save lives. I believe in the 
power of the people to rise up and be the [[government]] of the people, by the 
people, for the people as it was intended. This generation was meant to lead our
Nations back to balance. We were meant to protect this territory for our future 
generations. I believe in the power of our peoples to unite under a new [[treaty]].</p>
<p>Let’s end genocide against [[Indigenous]] peoples and ecocide against our planet.</p>
<p>Lets work together for the radical changes we need to save our people and the 
planet.</p>
<p>Wel'al'iog.</p>
