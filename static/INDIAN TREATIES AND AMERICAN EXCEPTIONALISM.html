<p>INDIAN TREATIES AND AMERICAN
EXCEPTION ALI S M :</p>
<p>PROLEGOMENA TO A STUDY OF
AMERICAN IDEOLOGY
PREFATORY NOTE
Some 75 years ago Constance Rourke died with her great study The
Roots of [[America]]n Culture ([[1942]]) unfinished. But her essential</p>
<p>method- what German philologists called Sachphilologie- was
already well known, and the essays in that last book left no doubt
about her argument: that "practical letters" as opposed to "polite lit-</p>
<p>erature" shaped "the earliest phases of our national life and" (she
went on to surmise) "perhaps for later phases [of the national [[history]]]
as well" (15, 11). Although her point of departure was [[Indian]] [[treaty]]making in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the force of her
general view of the "practical" orientation of [[America]]n literary and
cultural work was irresistible. This notable focus of both Early Amer-</p>
<p>ican Literature (whether Puritan or Enlightened, religious or secular) and its "Classic [[America]]n" legacies, helps us remember why and</p>
<p>how political and social issues would continue to suffuse and often
bedevil "[[America]]n Literature," even to the present.
This "Prolegomena" was written for a study of how to read the lit-</p>
<p>erary works that came out of the English-speaking [[America]]n
colonies. The work will end with a discussion of Jefferson s Notes on
the State of Virginia and the correspondence that Adams and Jefferson carried on in the last ten years of their lives. But it might as well
have served an examination of [[America]] s literary [[history]] as narrowly

conceived, that is, the corpus of "polite letters" that began in earnest
with Irving, Cooper, and Bryant. I have in mind to write that book as
well.</p>
<p>Traveling with Rourke s map opens up the [[America]]n world to a
fresh view of its distinctive ways of "imagining" itself in the world. We</p>
<p>would perhaps be driven to rethink Marjorie Perloff s great essay
"Pound/Stevens: Whose Era?" ([[1982]]) and ask instead (or in addition),
for instance, "Reznikoff/Moore: Whose Era?" And we might be able</p>
<p>to see why any conception of the "[[America]]n Renaissance" without
Poe and Dickinson won't do, and why Melville and the great writers</p>
<p>of [[Europe]] held Cooper in such honor, and why Martin Delany is as
important for our cultural memory as Frederick Douglass. Not many
recall that Douglass did not found The [[North]] Star by himself. But we
should.</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>Channeling Whitmans Democratic Vistas ([[1871]]), Richard Hofstadter observes that "It has been our fate as a nation not to have ideologies, but to be one." To the degree that this is the case, we would</p>
<p>have to call this "[[America]]n Ideology" (Seymour Lipseťs phrase) an
Ideology of Enlightenment.1 It established itself in two great historical phases. The first came in and as the seventeenth-century Puritan
establishment, the second in and as that eighteenth-century line of
social and political thought that we call the Enlightenment. Sharply
different as they are from each other, each is riven from within with
conflicts and divisions: Roger Williams v. the General Court of Massachusetts, Anne Hutchinson v. John Winthrop, Congregationalist v.</p>
<p>Quaker, Covenant v. Half-Covenant; and then, later, Paine v. a host
of the Founding Fathers, Burr v. Hamilton, Adams v. Jefferson,
Henry Clay and Daniel Webster v. Andrew Jackson. Both of those
foundational imaginary sets- the Puritan and the secular Enlightenment-remain to this day living cultural forces perpetuating the con-</p>
<p>tradictions of that double-edged sword we call [[America]]n
Exceptionalism. Most important, those respective habits of thought
and expression feed upon certain textual instruments that command
virtually absolute authority: in the first instance, the Bible; in the second, the [[America]]n Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Remarkably,</p>

<p>what began in [[North]] [[America]] as a struggle of religious commitments</p>
<p>found its fulfillment- by no means its completion- as a struggle of
secular ones.</p>
<p>Those contradictions have preoccupied everyone who studies
[[America]]n [[history]] and culture and they are as well my subject here.</p>
<p>While I want eventually to map those contradictions through key
works of so-called "Classic [[America]]n Literature ,"2 in this essay I
focus on the general pertinence of a particular and neglected set of
native [[America]]n cultural events: [[Indian]] Treaties.3</p>
<p>In a context dominated by global, transnational, and postcolonial
studies- our current situation- such an approach might be reasonably judged dead on arrival. But I take it as an important and neglected truth what the poet observed, that there are "dead but sceptred
sovereigns who still rule / Our spirits from their urns" (Byron, Manfred). Or in Trotskys inspiriting recalculation of Byron s cautionary
reflection, that there is "a privilege of historical backwardness" (4).</p>
<p>The peace and friendship [[treaties]]- "clasped hands" and "linking
arms together" [[treaties]]- were dominating cultural events in the
colonial period of [[America]]n [[history]] (Williams 53, 116).4 They are
important for understanding [[America]]n [[history]] and culture exactly
because the Revolution consigned them to what the new nation
regarded as a superseded past.</p>
<p>[[America]]n culture between about [[1780]] and [[1900]] is, with notable
exceptions, decidedly triumphal. In that spirit (critically framed as</p>
<p>Classic [[America]]n, or elevated to an [[America]]n Renaissance), it
brought forth a diverse body of imaginative prose and poetic reflections on [[America]]n [[history]] and experience. In that corpus of work the</p>
<p>customary terms of "The [[America]]n [[Cree]]d" of Exceptionalism are for better and for worse, in sickness or in [[health]]- on full display:
"[[liberty]], egalitarianism, individualism, populism, and laissez-faire"
(Lipset 19). The historical conditions that promoted those values
were Puritanism (the Puritan congregational [[government]]), the [[New]]
World frontier, and- finally- the [[America]]n Enlightenment (institu-</p>
<p>tions of a Republican democracy).
From the outset, [[America]]'s Enlightenment imagination, both in
its Puritan and its Republican forms, committed itself to a story that
locates the national [[history]] in the orbit of [[Western]] ideas and Euro-</p>
<p>pean colonial adventure. About 50 years ago Dale Van Every 's four-</p>

volume account oí The Frontier People of [[America]] ([[1754]]-[[1845]]) laid
out a finished narrative version of this mythic tale. The volume Forth
to the Wilderness ([[1961]]) is particularly eloquent. It gives an account</p>
<p>of colonial [[North]] [[America]] from the end of the Seven Years [[War]]
([[1763]]) through a series of brutal [[Indian]] conflicts to the end of Dunmore s [[War]] ([[1774]]) and the onset of the [[America]]n Revolution. In his</p>
<p>foreword, the distinguished historian Ray Billington sees Every s
work as a story "superbly" told, "distilling the essence from [[history]]</p>
<p>... to reveal the broad sweep of human progress" (ix).
The tale begins with the establishment in [[1763]] of George Ills
Proclamation Line, which set the chain of the Appalachian Mountains as the western limit of [[white]] colonial expansion in [[America]]. It
recounts the relentless pressure by colonists up and down that line to
break across and begin the occupation of [[Indian]] territories to the further west. It ends with what Every calls "The [[Great]] Crossing" (chapter XX), when Daniel Boone breached the line, entering what is now
Kentucky to found Boonesborough. A [[company]] of forty settlers soon
followed, "arriving at Boonesborough," Every knowingly writes, "the
day after Concord and Lexington" (1:348).</p>
<p>This is how Every describes the Proclamation Line:
On the one side was a civilized, politically and economically advanced community of industrious [[white]] men counseled by leaders of an intellectual
capacity capable of identifying the lightning or composing a Declaration of</p>
<p>Independence and on the other was a trackless, primordial wilderness
infested by scattered tribes of irresponsible belligerent savages. (1:16)</p>
<p>That is a lucid distillation of [[America]]n [[history]] as it was broadly
understood from the time of the earliest colonies until the [[1960]]s.
Although academic scholarship over the past five decades has complicated the story, it still dominates popular culture and contemporary politics. It feeds upon ideas, attitudes, and expressions that are as</p>
<p>commonplace in colonial [[New]] England and [[New]] York as in the first
Virginia settlements. This ideology would metastasize across the
continent as the land was progressively appropriated and settled,
forming and augmenting in the process a deeply meaningful corpus</p>
<p>of [[America]]n social and cultural memory and dream. Jefferson s
"Empire of Liberty" and Whitman s "[[New]] World," like the Protes-</p>

tant Reformation and its [[child]], the Puritan "errand into the wilderness" (Perry Miller), simply made course corrections to a [[history]] that
remained firmly Greco-[[Roma]]n and Judeao-Christian.
II</p>
<p>Robert Frosts poem "The Gift Outright" was written out of that ide-</p>
<p>ological nexus. The poem, Frost said, was "a [[history]] of the [[United]]
[[States]] in a dozen lines of blank verse" ( Collected Prose 150). His fac-</p>
<p>tual mismemory of the poem- it has sixteen lines- makes an interesting connection to the truncated [[history]] of the [[United]] [[States]] that
the poem offers. In Frosts projection, "a [[history]] of the [[United]] [[States]]"</p>
<p>only includes the Colonial Period as an explicitly rejected [[history]]Un[[America]]n, so to say, and not part of what the [[United]] [[States]]
"would become." "The Gift Outright" almost forgets, but not quite,</p>
<p>the complex colonial histories that set the terms for "such as [the
[[United]] [[States]]] would become" (348).
The poem s own composition [[history]] shows how texts often expose</p>
<p>certain matters of importance that they might have taken up but
chose not to. The received last line- "such as she would become" was originally written (during the [[1930]]s Depression) "such as she
might become." Later, when [[President]] [[Kennedy]] asked Frost to read
the poem at his inauguration, he also asked if Frost might change
that last line to "such as she will become." Frost said he would.5 The
difficult weather on Inauguration Day thwarted that decision, however. In the end Frost managed to recite only the first few lines of the
poem. We will never know which final line he might have spoken.</p>
<p>In Frosts nuanced argument, "we" [[America]]ns only become "possessed by" "the Land" when we make it a "deed of gift" of our lives
in war. Frost is playing with a memory of the gifted land deeds native</p>
<p>[[America]]ns made to English settlers during the colonial seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. One of the earliest of these was the [[1621]]
cession of Marthas Vineyard- Capawock was its [[Native]] name- to
the Plymouth settlers, and our popular [[history]] records many more,</p>
<p>some of them- like the land gifts William Penn told us he
received- legendary events in [[America]]n [[history]].6 These deeds of gift</p>
<p>would be scrupulously recorded by their colonial authors in many
written and printed documents. But those early native gifts, Frost</p>

suggests, would only get sealed when [[Europe]]an immigrants to Amer-</p>
<p>ica fought and died to take the land from the [[British]] Empire. The
poem imagines these "many deeds of war" as beginning with the
[[America]]n Revolution and then continuing the country s Manifest
Destiny to possess as much of the northern continent as possible
("vaguely realizing westward"). Frosts poem explicitly does not
remember the pre[[history]] of the Revolution and its many colonial
"deeds of war."
Unpacking the poem s argument in this way, we may glimpse the
tares growing in its field of waving grain. Frosts [[America]] is a memory</p>
<p>whose focus on the Revolution has erased the nearly 200 years of
colonial events that led up to it. That earlier period also saw "many
deeds of war." Among the most consequential were the conflicts that
caught up the colonists and the indigenes: the Powhatan [[War]]s ([[1610]]-</p>
<p>[[1646]]), the Pequot [[War]] ([[1637]]), [[King]] Philip's [[War]] ([[1675]]-[[1676]]), Bacon's
Rebellion ([[1676]]), [[King]] William's [[War]] ([[1689]]-[[1697]]), the Tuscarora
[[War]] ([[1711]]-[[1715]]), the Yamasee [[War]] ([[1715]]-[[1717]]), [[King]] George's [[War]]
([[1744]]-[[1748]]), the Seven Years [[War]] ([[1756]]-[[1763]]), the Anglo-Cherokee
[[War]] ([[1758]]-[[1761]]), Pontiacs Rebellion ([[1763]]-[[1764]]), Lord Dunmore's
[[War]] ([[1774]]), the Sullivan Expedition ([[1779]]). At the heart of all these
military actions were struggles over land that one party wanted to
acquire and control and the other wanted to keep or recover.
Because the natives and the invaders were possessed by entirely different ideas about land and their relation to it, however, the wars also
involved a funda[[mental]] conflict of civilizations.
Although the invaders won all the wars and the natives lost nearly
all their land, that ethnic conflict has not ended. If [[Native]] [[America]]n
tribal culture today is widespread and diverse, as it is, its civilities, like
those of all non-[[white]] "[[America]]ns," remain systematically suborned.</p>
<p>But that dismal subject isn't my subject. Rather, I want to suggest
why the documentary record of the colonial period, where many
deeds of war are set forth and glossed by the participants, must be</p>
<p>radically reconceived and reread. For ac[[company]]ing those colonial
deeds of war at every point were a succession of [[treaties]] and deeds of
peacemaking that equally engaged the conflicted parties. But a seri-</p>
<p>ous discourse problem makes a clear view of that codependent [[history]] difficult to achieve. While the surviving deeds and associated</p>

<p>Jerome McGanri / [[Indian]] Treaties and [[America]]n Exceptionalism 153</p>
<p>commentaries are textual and [[Western]], the [[treaty]] events that they
document were in great measure oral and [[aboriginal]].7
When [[Indian]] gifts of land were translated into [[Western]] (textual)
deeds of gift, native people came to recognize that a "pen and ink
witchcraft" was often - indeed, nearly always- involved.8 [[Native]] gift-</p>
<p>ing, as we shall see, could and did mutate into something else
entirely when its social rituals- public, oral, and face to face- got
textually represented in written deeds and [[treaties]]. This happened
because there was a mismatch between what the natives and the
immigrants understood when gifts were exchanged and [[treaties]]
about land were made. The difference in media reflects a profound
difference in social habitus.</p>
<p>When Stuart Banner comments that "the concept of a land sale
did not exist in [[North]] [[America]] before the English arrived," he identifies that crucial difference. Unlike the English who "had been buy-</p>
<p>ing and selling land for centuries" (Banner 58), [[Native]] [[America]]ns
did not own land, they lived in relation to it. As Canasatego put it in</p>
<p>a famous speech to the Middle Colonists at a [[treaty]] convention in
Philadelphia in [[1742]], his people, his ancestors, and their [[child]]ren all
"came out of the ground," which was, he added, "everlasting" (Boyd,
ed. 51).
Canasatego was describing the ethos of what we call a subsistence</p>
<p>economy. The People were part of a land that all creatures, not just
human creatures, used and, in using, sustained. For native peoples,
the land was more than a complex ecosystem, it was an existential
absolute. To adapt a figure from abstract [[Western]] philosophy, it was
Being in the cyclic Time of eternal return.</p>
<p>In that frame of reference, when we read in the colonial documentary records about [[Indian]]s "selling" lands that they "own," the
language is entirely [[white]] and [[Western]]. [[Indian]]s could not sell what
they did not own. That is why William Cronon, discussing seventeenth-century land deals between natives and settlers, observes that</p>
<p>they "had more to do with [[sovereignty]] than ownership" (66). The
Powhatan [[War]]s in Virginia erupted exactly because Powhatan
insisted that he, not the English [[colony]] or the [[Crown]], was- to adopt
that [[Western]] legal term- sovereign of the lands the English wanted</p>
<p>to settle.9 Only after three bloody wars- really, one long and</p>

renewed conflict ([[1610]]-[[1646]])- would the English be able to settle, at
least to their own satisfaction, their claim of [[sovereignty]]. They con-</p>
<p>quered and destroyed the Powhatan Confederacy.
Three years earlier, in [[1646]], the Wampanoag sachem Massasoit
delivered one of the earliest and most celebrated declarations of the
native view that their land was not alienable [[property]]. "What is this
you call [[property]]? It cannot be the earth. For the land is our Mother
. . . the woods, the streams, everything on it belongs to everybody and</p>
<p>is for the use of all."10 Like nearly every [[Indian]] spokesman who
would come after him, Massasoit did not recognize the concept of
[[sovereignty]] at all. For Massasoit, the land itself was sovereign source.
in</p>
<p>For quite a long time we have known that so-called "Classic [[America]]n Literature" is haunted, and that the haunting of our cultural
works has scarcely ceased to this day. "What exactly was haunting
antebellum [[America]]?" John Modern recently asked once again
(284). Everyone cites the scandal of [[slavery]]- "[[America]] s original
sin"- as at least one of the "unseen somethings haunting the day"
(7), and not a few have recognized a demon driving the wars to seize
the lands of [[Native]] [[America]]ns and destroy their civilizations ([[1610]]-</p>
<p>[[1890]]). Largely focused on later, less primal nightmares, John Modern argued that they all reflect a philosophical ground he calls "the</p>
<p>secular imaginary" (289). "More than an ideology" (282)- by which
he means more than a constellation of related ideas- "the secular
imaginary" is a quasi-religious faith,
a moral force, a connective tissue, a widely shared and massively intricate set
of epistemological assumptions. And like anything in excess of ideology, secularism defies logic, particularly its own. Consequently, it may be well-nigh
impossible to measure the powers of this normalizing process in which the
truly religious and the truly secular emerge as compatible, if not wholly continuous. (282-83)</p>
<p>"What is haunting [[America]]" is, briefly, what popular culture has
called the [[America]]n Dream, so darkly addressed yet again by TaNehisi Coates in Between the World and Me. The nightmares that</p>

<p>Jerome McGarin / [[Indian]] Treaties and [[America]]n Exceptionalism 155</p>
<p>mutate from this dream are true historical realities- for instance, the
[[history]] of [[violence]] in [[America]]- that get repeatedly translated, trans-</p>
<p>formed, and recycled. Thomas Pynchon imagined them as the
Thanatoids of Vineland. George Romero made them famous in a
series of films about "the Living Dead."</p>
<p>For Modern, "a language of ghostly possession" (xxix) underpins
both Puritan and Enlightenment discourse. We are One Nation,
under God, but God is now a "secular imaginary" pervading the
exponents of [[America]]: according to the eclectic subtitle of Moderns
book, "ghosts, Protestant subcultures, machines, and their metaphors
. . . mass media, Moby-Dick , spirituality, phrenology, anthropology,</p>
<p>Sing Sing Penitentiary, and sex with the new motive power." This
comical and perverse list carries an unnerving argument-by-invitation: that we might each of us extend the list, according to our lights.</p>
<p>For in Modern s view, the names of this demon are Legion and,
more trying, they possess [[America]]. The secular imaginary itself
could have been, perhaps should have been, added to Modern s list.
It seems true, perhaps by definition, that this secular imaginary
"defies logic," not least of all the logic of Modern s critical account.</p>
<p>But because that secular imaginary is, as Modern points out, "a languages'-indeed, a living language- and therefore far from defying
use and expression, I don't think it defies exposure and description.</p>
<p>Such at any rate is my premise here, where I take a philological
rather than a philosophical approach to the issues Modern addresses.
That is to say, I try not to imagine that we students stand aside our</p>
<p>subjects. My view proceeds from the inner standing point of my
[[America]]n language. In this way I hope to turn a small screw on the
prevailing logic of critical method in order to seize the advantage
one gains from close encounter where, as Laura (Riding) Jackson
might say, "failure stalks in every word" (66).</p>
<p>I say "a small screw" because I take my bearings from the peace
and friendship [[Indian]] [[treaties]]- a corpus of [[America]]n discourse
undervalued by scholars of "Classic [[America]]n Literature" and its
abounding sequels: the scenes of encounter engaged- and then variously recorded- in the conferences and formal [[treaties]] made
between [[Native]] [[America]]ns and Anglo-[[America]]ns from the early seventeenth century through the founding of the [[America]]n republic in</p>

the late eighteenth century. In those colonial documents, along with</p>
<p>the contemporary narratives and commentaries that fill out their
social and historical contexts, we can discover important upstream
sources for what would later become a vast watershed.11 Deploying
an ecological figure in the subtitle to one of his most famous and
in[[flu]]ential works (The Pioneers), Fenimore Cooper called that watershed "The Sources of the Susquehanna." A complex river system was
Cooper s figure for the complex [[America]]n [[history]] that was his book s
true subject.12
Almost 100 years ago Lawrence Wroth wrote a trenchant essay on</p>
<p>the significance of these documentary remains. He called the
[[treaties]]</p>
<p>a neglected literary type that arose without conscious artistic design from the
conflict of two distinct civilizations on the same soil- a type in which one
reads the passion, the greed, and the love of life of hard-living men brought
into close relationship without parallel conditions in the [[history]] of either race
to guide its conduct. (766)</p>
<p>The sentence is remarkable is several ways. Consider first of all that</p>
<p>he describes these encounters as a "conflict of two distinct civilizations ." With few early [[America]]n exceptions- Thomas Morton and
Roger Williams are notable- the [[Western]] view has been, and still
generally is, that Contact was between civilized (Early Modern) and
uncivilized (Neolithic) peoples. Equally remarkable is that Wroth
correctly saw "a neglected literary type" in these materials. But his
account did not go on to parse this overlooked genre or explicate its</p>
<p>deep significance. The deficiency was in great part removed by the
ethno-historian of [[Native]] [[America]] William N. Fenton in his seminal
essay "Structure, Continuity, and Change in the Process of Iroquois
[[Treaty]] Making."
Given the number and variety of [[treaties]] and [[treaty]]-makers in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Fenton s focus on the Iroquois
might seem too restricted. But in fact he chose well. First of all, the</p>
<p>documentary record he could draw on is large and, even more

<p>when he published records of thirteen in his series of impressive
folios.13 Fenton went behind the surface features of the [[treaties]] to dis-</p>
<p>close the imaginative vision that shaped their meaning. The [[treaties]]
were a structured, flexible, and highly articulated set of social cere-</p>
<p>monies that could involve thousands of participants and that typically lasted many days, weeks, even months.
More than "the product of the interaction of the two cultures," the
[[treaties]] were "a species of drama in which the Iroquois were the playwrights, the directors, and teaching actors, and the joint producers
with the colonial hosts" (Fenton 7). 14 Fenton sketched in good detail
the general ritual forms and [[treaty]] protocols that grew organically</p>
<p>with the historical emergence of the Iroquois Confederacy itself.
They were a great [[Indian]] power in the regions where the [[British]] were</p>
<p>establishing their early settlements in the seventeenth century. By
the late seventeenth century, as the colonies matured and the settlers</p>
<p>began pushing further westward, the Iroquois League had become
the chief native power in the region.
Most important of all, Fenton s synthetic analysis of the Iroquois</p>
<p>Covenant Chain [[treaties]] threw into relief a widely dispersed [[Native]]
[[America]]n cultural mindset. We now think of the [[treaties]] almost
exclusively in relation to their non-native participants, the [[New]] England, Middle, and [[South]]ern colonies that entered into them. But the
Iroquois [[treaties]] were a social deduction drawn out of a general diplo-</p>
<p>matic system that was operating well before the [[Europe]]ans found
their way to [[North]] [[America]].</p>
<p>The Iroquois [[treaty]] design is a social machinery for establishing
peace and cooperation in a scene fraught with the threat of [[violence]].</p>
<p>It pivots on the gift exchange rituals- "total prestation"- famously
described in Marcel Mauss s The Gift. Initiating and maintaining
ceremonial gift exchanges were funda[[mental]] to the Neolithic civilizations of [[North]] [[America]]. In his classic study Stone Age Economics ,
Marshall Sahlins explicated Mauss s theory of gift exchange through</p>
<p>an extended comparison with Hobbes s Leviathan. For both Hobbes
and Mauss, because "the understructure of society is war" (Sahlins
171), mechanisms for avoiding its destructive inertia are imperative.
Hobbes s first law of nature "is to seek Peace, and follow it" (177), and</p>
<p>the modern secular state is the means for institutionalizing his
famous Laws of Nature.15 "So in structure, [Hobbes s] argument</p>

unites with Mauss s. . . . Hobbes understands the suppression of
[[War]]re neither through the victory of one nor by the submission of all,</p>
<p>but in a mutual surrender ' (177). That is the equivalent of Mauss s
total prestation, the giving of gifts laying upon the receiver the obligation of reciprocity. In Sahlins' summary:
The Gift transposes the classic alternatives of war and [[trade]] from the periphery</p>
<p>to the very center of social life, and from the occasional episode to the continuous presence. . . . [Primitive society is at war with [[War]]re, and ... all their
dealings are [[treaties]] of peace. All their exchanges, that is to say, must bear in
their material design some political burden of reconciliation. (182)</p>
<p>The native people of [[America]] understood the authority and power
of native kinship rules and gift-giving rituals. But because their histo-</p>
<p>ries and geographies were not completely aligned- Abenaki and
Ojibway, Narragansett and Pequot, Powhatan and Susquehannock,
Iroquois and Algonquin- they were regularly thrown into the blood
feuds and mourning wars that were a function of their own kinship</p>
<p>obligations.16 The Iroquois League was created- probably sometime
in the fifteenth century- around a series of ceremonial institutions</p>
<p>that brought the original "Five Nations" of the League into cooperative relations. Those were the Onondaga, Oneida, Seneca, Cayuga,
and [[Mohawk]].</p>
<p>So founded, the original Iroquois League fashioned a system of
diplomatic intercourse that many different people throughout the
region, native as well as non-native, could accommodate. When
Benjamin Franklin proposed his famous Albany Plan at the [[Congress]] of [[1755]], he explicitly invoked the example of the Iroquois Confederacy. A coalition of allied colonies seemed to him the best means
"for our common defense and Security." As his celebrated cartoon of
the dissevered snake urged: "Join, or die." While his Albany Plan was
rejected at the [[1855]] [[Congress]], it would be in great part adopted when
the colonies became the Confederate [[States]] of [[America]] and, finally,
the [[United]] [[States]] of [[America]].17</p>
<p>The allied nations of the Iroquois League supplied the public ritual that shaped what we call the series of Covenant Chain [[treaty]]
makings ([[1677]]-[[1768]]), which involved different [[Crown]] colonies as
well as many [[indigenous]] people of the eastern region. The structure</p>

<p>Jerome McGann / [[Indian]] Treaties and [[America]]n Exceptionalism 159</p>
<p>was a sophisticated dilation of the gift-exchange ceremonies that
were such an axial feature of native societies in [[North]] [[America]]. The</p>
<p>Iroquois League executed a complex public event for renewing "the
charter myth of the [[Great]] Peace" (Fenton 14), whose outward and
visible sign was the Iroquois League itself. The ceremonies reflect
and replay the events in the foundational epic of Deganawidah, the
legendary Iroquois prophet who revealed "the [[Great]] Law" of peace
that founded the Iroquois Confederacy, the [[alliance]] of five (and
eventually six) nations that had previously been in recurrent conflict.
English settlers and native people entered into their first [[treaty]] in</p>
<p>[[1621]]. It was made between the Plymouth [[colony]] and Massasoit, the
sachem of the Wampanoag Confederacy. Although the Plymouth
settlers immediately abstracted it to a documentary record ([[March]]
[[1621]]), the [[treaty]] itself involved a series of diplomatic ceremonies and</p>
<p>gift exchanges that extended over nine months and culminated in
that mythic [[America]]n event called "the first Thanksgiving."18 As for</p>
<p>the [[treaties]] with the Iroquois League, the earliest record we have is
the [[1645]] [[Treaty]] of Trois-Rivières made with [[New]] [[France]]. James N.
Fenton, Francis Jennings, and Mary Drucke have elucidated the
form, symbology, and historical context of this [[treaty]], supplying as
well a reprint of an English translation of the original account from</p>
<p>the Jesuit Relations ( Iroquois Diplomacy 127-53). Unlike the record
of the [[1621]] [[treaty]], the Jesuit Relations set down an unusually meticulous account of the events as they were orchestrated by the Iroquois</p>
<p>for their [[French]] hosts. But the two [[treaties]] exhibit the same basic
structure of Maussian reciprocal gift exchange ceremonials that get
repeated over time.19 The [[Treaty]] of Trois-Rivières shows, in addition,
the sophisticated forms that the Iroquois brought to the basic native</p>
<p>gift-exchange rituals of the Covenant Chain [[treaties]]. Fenton has
neatly summarized the "paradigm" that these spectacular ceremonials followed (28-30). A decisive innovation of Iroquois [[treaty]] making</p>
<p>was the Condolence Ceremony ( Iroquois Diplomacy 150, 151), perhaps the most distinctive feature of Iroquois [[treaty]]-making: what the</p>
<p>Jesuit recording the [[Treaty]] of Trois-Rivières called a "bond ... to
console . . . and to wipe away . . . tears, according to the fashion of
the barbarians" (150, 151). 20</p>

CODA AS INCONCLUSIVE UNSCIENTIFIC POSTSCRIPT
I have been sketching a crucial part of a continuous [[history]] stretching from the early seventeenth century to the late eighteenth cen-</p>
<p>tury. It describes the principal means of social and political contact
in the foundational colonial period. [[America]]n native peoples and
English immigrant communities negotiated their practical lifeworld
relations through "barbarian" diplomatic protocols.
To the extent that accommodation rather than force was the set-</p>
<p>tlers' chosen modus operandi with the [[Indian]]s, the available means
were different versions of these native gift-exchange ceremonials.
They mark an exceptionalism that has never been considered in the</p>
<p>obsessive discussions of [[America]]n Exceptionalism. The subject is
normally taken up within a [[Western]] secular imagination of historical</p>
<p>continuities and social progress. Of course, even such stadial imaginations of change recognize that they involve cultural upheaval, as
Karl Polanyi's epochal work The [[Great]] Transformation ([[1944]])
showed.</p>
<p>But Polanyi s tale of the Wests struggle to move from feudal to
modern social and economic institutions is thoroughly [[Western]] in its</p>
<p>focus. It does not reflect the radical character of the encounters
between natives and invaders on [[America]]n soil: a centuries-long
face-to-face rendezvous between two profoundly different types of
civilization; in the stadial terminology that still dominates our think-</p>
<p>ing, one Early Modern, the other Neolithic. To grasp the radical
character of the difference, consider the ioo-year-long [[British]] struggle to [[conquer]] [[Ireland]], an event that overlapped the [[British]] invasion
of [[America]] and supplied the invader with many of its military and
civic leaders.21 In that case, the English were clashing with a late feu-</p>
<p>dal civilization from which England itself was only beginning to
emerge. Despite fierce divisions, not least of all religious divisions,
the parties shared common memetic forms and were often able to</p>
<p>meet on common ground. [[America]] was completely different
because it already had sophisticated economic and social mechanisms that the Euro-[[America]]ns had to study and learn. Crucially,
those native means for mitigating or preventing hostilities and, more
positively, for enabling [[trade]] and social intercourse were civic instruments of [[aboriginal]] design.</p>

<p>Jerome McGanri / [[Indian]] Treaties and [[America]]n Exceptionalism 161</p>
<p>The native mechanisms reflect a need for conservative and stabi-</p>
<p>lizing mechanisms in social spaces prone to [[violence]] and war. They
are the political face of those subsistence economies that Marshall
Sahlins in [[1972]] called "The Original Af[[flu]]ent Society." In our postmodern perspective, Sahlins s view seems at once true, preposterous,
and unsettling.22 Firsthand seventeenth-century witnesses confirm
that truth when they marvel at the rich natural resources of the [[New]]
World. They all testify to and corroborate the power of the Neolithic
subsistence technologies they discovered with the discovery of Amer-</p>
<p>ica. But to John Locke- who never set foot in [[America]], though he
was deeply involved in exploiting its resources- the view was prepos-</p>
<p>terous. As he remarks in his Second Treatise of Civil Government
([[1690]]), [[Native]] [[America]]ns "are rich in Land, and poor in all the Comforts of Life."23 The contradiction between those perspectives turns</p>
<p>deeply unsettling when we suspect, as many now do, that extreme
social alienation and conditions of endemic [[poverty]] are intimately
bound up with technological achievements and political progress on
one hand, and with ecological degradation and global threats to the
biosphere on the other.</p>
<p>What is haunting [[America]] is a stunned memory negatively preserved in those [[treaties]], where a social mechanism for sustaining
Generation through Non[[violence]] was set in motion to blunt or arrest</p>
<p>the social inertias, both native and non-native, of Regeneration
through Violence (Slotkin). The English parties that originally coop-</p>
<p>erated in colonial [[treaty]]making generally did so in bad faith, and
after the Revolution they apostacized altogether. Although forced by</p>
<p>circumstance to participate in "barbarian" political ceremonies, the
English immigrants regarded them for almost two centuries as tem-</p>
<p>porizing social expedients that they would sooner or later leave
behind, as in fact they did. Because the native people who devised
those ceremonies lived in territorialized ecospace and moved to
cyclic, seasonal time, "temporizing social expedients" had a very different valence. For the native people, to be civilized meant to be sen-</p>
<p>sible about the encompassing natural world, on one hand, and to
work out stable, expedient, and timely social mechanisms on the
other. Those would be the [[treaties]] that (a) were based in total prestation, and (b) had to be regularly renewed.</p>

But for the apostates and especially for their [[child]]ren who constructed a Classic [[America]]n Literature, the memory of a lost civiliza-</p>
<p>tion preserved a secret life. We glimpse it in Crevecoeur s Letters
from an [[America]]n Farmer ([[1782]]) and even more in Jeffersons Notes
on the State of Virginia ([[1785]]) and the tormented fictions of Charles</p>
<p>Brockden Brown. But it is the career of James Fenimore Cooper
where the dark truth of lost civilization - native and non-native becomes first completely visible. At that point, what we call "[[America]]n Literature" began in earnest.
Which of the documents of western civilization before James Fenimore Cooper realized that those documents of barbarism- the gift-</p>
<p>exchange rituals and clasped-hands [[treaties]]- were transmitting
messages of great importance for downstream [[America]]? We know
that Franklin was listening both from his famous [[treaty]] folios and
from his Albany Plan, which looked back to the organization of the</p>
<p>Iroquois League and forward to the Confederate [[States]] of [[America]].
Or consider that while we customarily track the beginning of an
environ[[mental]] consciousness in [[America]] from Cooper to Thoreau,
its roots are native and it was [[indigenous]] [[America]]ns who sacrificed
their lives to preserve it.
Classic [[America]]n Literature and culture feeds off its colonial legacies, as we know. The culture of [[America]]n [[slavery]] is a great part of
that inheritance. But at least equally significant has been the legacy</p>
<p>bequeathed through [[aboriginal]]/colonial contact. Whether contact
was engaged in the Puritan colonies of [[New]] England, the [[plantation]]
colonies of the [[South]], or the mercantile Middle Colonies, the events</p>
<p>were tense, perilous, and always brinked to conflict. The [[Indian]]
[[treaties]] and their [[white]] documentary translations provide an invalu-</p>
<p>able-if also fractured and obscured- record of foundational [[America]]n [[history]].</p>
<p>Or consider briefly an early derivative record, the epochal Last of</p>
<p>the Mohicans , which ends with an elaborate Condolence Ceremony. But in Cooper s mournful representation, it is not being practiced, it is being dismally elegized. The scene shows native [[America]]n
[[history]] mutating into [[white]] [[America]]n myth. Presiding over the cere-</p>
<p>mony is the Delaware sachem Tamenund (ca. [[1625]]- ca. [[1701]]), whose
[[treaty]] making with William Penn licensed the happy [[America]]n legend of [[Indian]]/colonial peace and friendship [[treaty]] making. We now</p>

<p>Jerome McGann / [[Indian]] Treaties and [[America]]n Exceptionalism 163
know that those founding [[treaty]] arrangements were far less happy</p>
<p>than legend has argued.24 When Tamenund reappears in Cooper s
work he is a literal ghost, having died a half century before the date
of the action of Cooper's "Narrative of [[1757]]." Cooper s re-enactment</p>
<p>of the Condolence Ceremony is thus a spectral event, as we see
when Colonel Munro, mourning the [[death]]s of Uncas and his [[child]]
Cora, addresses the assembly. "The time shall not be distant," Munro</p>
<p>dreams, "when we may assemble . . . without distinction of sex, or
rank, or color." To which Cooper appends Leatherstocking s mordant gloss:
The scout listened to the tremulous voice in which the veteran delivered
these words, and shook his head slowly when they were ended, as one who
doubted their efficacy. "To tell them this," he said, "would be to tell them that
the snows come not in the winter, or that the sun shines fiercest when the
trees are stripped of their leaves." (Chapter 33)</p>
<p>The Last of the Mohicans ends in a Condolence Ceremony of peace
and friendship that Cooper s work remembers but disbelieves. His
career from The Last of the Mohicans ([[1826]]) to The Crater ([[1847]]) will</p>
<p>follow an arc of deepening skepticism, and a long line of [[America]]n
imaginative reflection will inherit and perpetuate that unhappy con-</p>
<p>[[[[science]]]]. Reflecting on "Edgar Poe s Significance," Whitman called
that con[[[[science]]]] the "malady" of [[America]] (230). Poe, Melville, Twain,
Henry Adams, the late James of The [[America]]n Scene : in each we read</p>
<p>the tormented renunciation of the exceptional [[America]]n Dream
originally revealed- unexpectedly, unbelievably- with [[aboriginal]]
Contact.
Paradoxically, the dream would survive through all those confessions of betrayal and disbelief. Even the Belle of Amherst made her
work a mirror, and herself an index, of her Strange Nation s contradictory estrangements.25 We do not forget her 11 [[June]] [[1852]] letter to</p>
<p>her beloved Susan. Reflecting on the Whig convention in Baltimore
being torn apart over the question of [[slavery]], Dickinson added a mor-</p>
<p>dant postscript: "'Delenda esť [[America]], Massachusetts and all!" And
then came the letter s famous last words, warning Susan to "open me
carefully" lest her forlorn testament shock her friend or, perhaps, her
father, who was attending the convention and was carrying the letter</p>

to Susan (1:211-12). 26 A great [[America]]n Apostate's [[Cree]]d, those two</p>
<p>sentences could be an epigraph for the internal exile she chose, the
world elsewhere she imagined and lived.

<p>The study of [[Indian]] [[treaties]] probably should begin with the following two works:
Julian P. Boyd, ed., [[Indian]] Treaties Printed by Benjamin Franklin [[1736]]-[[1762]] ([[1938]]),
and Francis Jennings et al., ed., The History and Culture of Iroquois Diplomacy
([[1995]]). Other important works, in chronological order, are: Lawrence C. Wroth,

<li>Other [[treaties]] in the colonial period were imposed forcibly upon native people by
colonials who had defeated them in war. These are not the [[treaties]] I am concerned
with here. The clasped-hands figure appears on wampum [[treaty]] belts and eventually
found its way into the embossed [[treaty]] medals that were a regular feature of later
[[treaties]]- when, ironically, only the [[white]] hand wielded authority.</li>
<li>The actual event turned out even more messy. He decided to write a new poem
for the occasion and did, but the weather was so blustery that he couldn't read what
he'd newly written, so he spontaneously began reciting "The Gift Outright" from
memory. See Axelrod 209-10.</li>
<li>
<p>Like all the land cessions made by the chief of the Wampanoag Confederacy to
the Plymouth Colony, the Capowack gift was a gift of usufruct rights. See Cronon,
chapter 4.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I say "in great measure" because we do have some wampum records for the late
[[treaties]] (see Iroquois [[Indian]]s: A Documentary History ). In general, "Wampum served
as aids to memory and storytelling as well as being ritualized gifts and records of
agreements" (Calloway 27). But the colonial wampum record is seriously fractured
and we remain uncertain, even profoundly ignorant, about how it was operating in
the [[treaty]]making ceremonies except in the most general ways. See Speck and Snyderman, "The Function of Wampum in Iroquois Religion." More studies of these
documents as [[treaty]] records are needed. Mary A. Drucke's "Iroquois Treaties" in Iroquois Diplomacy is the best place to start. Useful discussion can be found in J. R.</p>

8. [[Ottawa]] chief Egushawa originally used the phrase in [[1791]] when he spoke of "pen
and ink witchcraft, [by] which they can make to speak things we never intended, or
had any idea of, even an hundred years hence; just as they please" (11). The phrase
enters the title of Calloway's excellent study. Note Egushawa 's "an hundred years
since" and the depth of the cultural memory it signals.
9. See Vaughan, ed., 4:8-9, 28. Seth Mallios has demonstrated how "[deteriorating
exchange-based relations" undermined the settlement efforts at Ajacan, Roanoke,</p>
<p>and Jamestown (23), but, as Mallios shows (see 21, 61, 69, 101-3), "exchangebased relations" were weak and uncertain from the outset.

13. These are the [[treaties]] in Boyd's edition.
14. Fenton calls the colonists the [[treaty]] "hosts" because the Covenant Chain [[treaty]]
events nearly always took place at colonial venues (Albany, Lancaster, etc). The
political implication of this arrangement should not be misunderstood. It is a sign of
deference to the [[Indian]] nations, whose presence at the [[treaties]] has to be requested
by the [[Crown]] colonies, who are also expected to bear the entire expense of the event
(an obligation that the colonial hosts would often complain about).
15. See Leviathan Book I, chapter 14: "the first and funda[[mental]] law of Nature,
which is, 'to seek peace, and follow it.' The second, the sum of the right of Nature,
which is, 'by all means we can, to defend ourselves.' From this funda[[mental]] law of
Nature, by which men are commanded to endeavour peace, is derived this second
law, 'that a man be willing, when others are so too, as far-forth as for peace and
defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things, and</p>
<p>be contented with so much [[liberty]] against other men as he would allow other men
against himself.' For as long as every man holdeth this right of doing anything he
liketh, so long are all men in the condition of war. But if other men will not lay down</p>
<p>their right as well as he, then there is no reason for any one to divest himself of his;
for that were to expose himself to prey, which no man is bound to, rather than to dis-</p>
<p>pose himself to peace."

relation to the Deganawida mythos. For the actual structure of the ceremonial see
Fenton's commentary, 17-22. Jon Parmenter has many useful insights into the early
[[history]] of Iroquois [[treaty]]ing with the [[French]]. See also where he points out that the
[[treaties]] and councils were designed to facilitate a subsistence use of the land (2941)-</p>

difficult is now clear, however. In [[1684]], three years after Tamenend gifted lands to
Penn, the sachem took a very different line, and Penn- back in England- wrote to
his surveyor that Tamenend should be handled with severity. See Varga. "In [[1685]]
after Penn returned to England, Tammany apparently regretted the cession of territory and warned the new settlers to vacate the land. Some reportedly took his threats
seriously and moved to [[New]] Jersey. To still the panic, Penn ordered measures taken
to bring Tammany to order." Weslager 169. See also Myers, ed., where the matter is
