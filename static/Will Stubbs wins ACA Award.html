<p>I just saw this news release, and I may be late to the party, but I wanted to 
share the great news that Will Stubbs from the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre has 
been given the [[Australia]] Council Visual Arts Award (Advocate)<a href="http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/news/events/australia-council-awards-[[2015]]/awards/" title="link">1</a> by the 
[[Australia]] Council for the Arts:</p>
<p>Will Stubbs is coordinator at the Buku-Larrnggay Mulka Centre in Yirrkala, NT,
  and a passionate advocate of [[Indigenous]] arts and [[Australia]]’s unique arts 
  centres. A former criminal lawyer, Will in [[1995]] began working with Yolŋu 
  elders and artists, such as Djambawa Marawili AM, Gawirrin Gumana AO and 
  Wanyubi Marika. The Yirrkala artists have since won 30 major art prizes and 
  exhibited widely and internationally, including Musee du Quai Branly.</p>
<p>“A passionate advocate” in some senses hardly seems to capture the intensity of 
Will’s devotion to Yolngu art and culture; in another way, to call Will’s 
low-key approach to educating people, cajoling sponsors, and building programs 
“passionate” seems oddly off-key. Will burns with an intense but quiet light and
he’s been one of the greatest of my mentors in coming to understand [[Indigenous]] 
culture.</p>
<p>I spent an amazing day<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/[[2005]]/11/06/the-yirrkala-church-panels-kinship-country-and-numbers/" title="link">2</a> with Will in Yirrkala ten years ago, my first ever 
visit to a community and an art centre. I couldn’t absorb enough information, 
whether in the form of stories, sights, smells, or the sounds of yidaki played 
by [[kids]] storming through the art centre after school. When the day was done, 
Will pulled me aside and told me to relax. “I know you’re eager to learn,” he 
said. “You shouldn’t work so hard at it. It will come to you in time.”</p>
<p>Those were probably the smartest words of advice anyone’s ever given me on this 
subject. I took them to heart and prospered.</p>
<p>My hat’s off to you, Will. Again.</p>
