<p>OF TREATIES AND TORTURE:
HOW THE SUPREME COURT CAN
RESTRAIN THE EXECUTIVE
Jeffrey C. Goldman</p>
<p>Introduction1</p>
<p>The [[Bush]] administration's original (and now superseded)
"torture memos" strain contemporary understandings of the [[United]]</p>
<p>[[States]]' obligations under the Convention Against Torture.2 These
documents also mock traditional understandings of the relationship
between international law and [[treaties]] and of the executive's power</p>
<p>to interpret and apply them.3 Perhaps most alarming are the</p>
<p>administration's attempts to undermine the spirit of both domestic</p>
<p>legislation and international law by employing a "strict
constructionist" interpretive methodology while embracing an
expansive view of executive power. The [[Bush]] administration's

Court with legitimate, constitutional reasons to overrule
[[congress]]ional and executive [[treaty]] interpretations. Although U.S.
courts long ago adopted a rule of construction that accorded [[treaties]]
and statutes equal weight,8 jurists added a caveat: "fujnless it is for
some reason distinguishable from other laws, the rule which [a [[treaty]]]
gives may be displaced by the legislative power, at its pleasure."9</p>
<p>Treaties dealing with peremptory norms are categorically
different from other [[treaties]]. Human rights [[treaties]], and related
implementing legislation, grant specific and far-reaching rights
directly to individuals. These rights, by virtue of reason, should be
held by courts as equal to constitutional freedoms and rights; like
those freedoms and rights, neither the executive nor the legislative
branch should be able to alter or infringe them in any but the most
compelling circumstances (and certainly not unilaterally, as by
executive order). The Supreme Court's recognition of this
equivalence would give it an axe to wield that it cannot carry into
interpretative [[battle]]s regarding other [[treaties]].10 This axe can restore
the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial
branches and ensure that the [[United]] [[States]], which has led the world
in recognizing and promoting human rights, retains its high moral
ground.
This Note argues that because human rights are funda[[mental]] in
nature, and because the exercise of constitutional rights is predicated
on the enjoyment of more basic human rights, courts should treat
human rights [[treaties]] differently than other international agreements
the [[United]] [[States]] has signed or ratified. Part I of this Note reviews</p>

has entered the canon of such norms. Part II begin
of the function and interpretation of [[treaties]]</p>
<p>argues that human rights [[treaties]] should be categorically</p>
<p>distinguished from those dealing with other subjects. It then argues</p>
<p>that equating human rights with constitutional rights is both</p>
<p>appropriate and necessary if human rights [[treaties]] are to achieve their</p>
<p>full potential. Part III suggests a limit for the executive's [[treaty]]
interpretation power and specifically demonstrates that executive
power to terminate [[treaties]] unilaterally does not extend to human
rights [[treaties]]. Part III then argues that recognizing human rights
[[treaties]] as a distinct category offers the judiciary a way to restrain the
executive without running afoul of the political question doctrine.</p>
<p>I. International Law, Peremptory Norms, and Torture</p>
<p>This Part examines the relationship between international law,
peremptory norms, and torture. Section A describes the [[history]] of
U.S. courts' recognition of international law and the Supreme Court's
understanding of the relationship between domestic and international
law. Section B defines j us cogens (peremptory) norms and their place
in the international law hierarchy and establishes torture as a jus
cogens norm.</p>
<p>A. Recognition of International Law by U.S. Courts</p>
<p>International law "consists of rules and principles of general
application dealing with the conduct of states and of international
organizations and with their relations . . . [including] some of their</p>
<p>relations with persons."11 These rules are derived from [[treaties]],</p>
<p>customs, and principles common to major world legal systems.12 This</p>
<p>definition, however, does not explain how U.S. courts have</p>
<p>traditionally treated international law in general, and customary
international law and jus cogens specifically. This Section briefly
describes U.S. jurisprudence regarding international law.</p>

<p>court acknowledged that there were "few, if any, issues in
international law ... on which opinion seems to be so united as the
limitations on a state's power to torture."44 And, in discussing whether</p>
<p>the [[United]] Nations Charter conveyed individual rights to citizens of
member countries, the court added that "the guaranties include, at a
bare minimum, the right to be free from torture."45 Interestingly,
Filartiga was decided almost fifteen years prior to the [[United]] [[States]]'</p>
<p>accession to the Convention Against Torture, supporting the
contention that torture had already achieved the status of a</p>
<p>peremptory, binding norm prior to the Convention.46</p>
<p>As a jus cogens norm, torture deserves greater protection than</p>
<p>other rights - perhaps even greater protection than other
constitutional rights. As discussed in Part II, this heightened
protection suggests a way to distinguish [[treaties]] by subject matter.
II. Distinguishing Human Rights Treaties</p>
<p>The previous Part established that the U.S. is boun</p>
<p>international law and that torture is widely recognized as a j</p>
<p>norm under international law. This Part discusses the rel
between international and domestic law, focusing on treatie</p>

[[treaties]] and seeks to distinguish between those [[treaties]]</p>

<p>law. Section A also reviews U.S. courts' traditiona
[[treaties]] and the relationship between [[treaties]], in
domestic law. Section B equates the substantive r
human rights [[treaties]], especially jus cogens norms,
rights.</p>
<p>At the outset, the looming presence of Goldwater v. Carter1
should be acknowledged. In Goldwater, a plurality of the Court held
that a challenge to [[President]] Carter's unilateral termination of a
commercial [[treaty]] with [[Taiwan]] was a nonjusticiable political
question.48 Although Goldwater has precedential value, its reasoning
should apply only to certain types of [[treaties]]. Specifically, this Note</p>
<p>argues that Goldwatefs nonjusticiability rule should apply only to
commercial [[treaties]] and should not apply to human rights [[treaties]]. As</p>
<p>this Note explains in Section A and further develops in Part III.A,
commercial and human rights [[treaties]] can be distinguished on the
basis of purpose (contractual vs. codification) and subject matter
(commercial vs. human rights). These distinctions are crucial in
deter[[mining]] whether nonjusticiability should apply.</p>
<p>A. Methods for Distinguishing Treaties
A [[treaty]] is "[a]n agreement formally signed, ratified, or adhered</p>
<p>to between two nations or sovereigns; an international agreement
concluded between two or more states in written form and governed
by international law."49 A [[treaty]] is, essentially, a "contract between
nations" and is usually treated like a contract rather than a legislative</p>
<p>act.50 Madison commented that "[t]he object of [[treaties]] is the
regulation of intercourse with foreign nations and is external."51</p>

not be limited to those agreements executed under the president's Article II authority. See, e.g.,</p>
</li>

instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation"); B.

<p>However, although [[treaties]] often resemble contract
sometimes perform statutory or legislative functions</p>
<p>in the [[United]] [[States]], where [[treaties]] are considered
the land.53 Both contractual and lawmaking treat
considered sources of international law; neither in</p>
<p>domestic law, however, accords all laws equa</p>
<p>example, the consequence of breaching a contract</p>
<p>different from the consequence for breakin</p>
<p>[[incarceration]]). In the second half of the twent
international agreements typically focused on economic,
transportation-communication, cultural-technical, diplomatic, and
military issues.55</p>
<p>Historically, U.S. courts have interpreted [[treaties]] "in the manner</p>
<p>and to the extent [to] which the parties have declared, and not
otherwise."56 The Supreme Court has no power "to alter, amend, or
add to any [[treaty]], by inserting any clause" because that "would be to
make, and not to construe a [[treaty]]."57 Treaties generally are deemed
to have the same weight as federal law but are not superior to the</p>
<p>Constitution.58</p>
<p>The remainder of this Section describes the traditional</p>
<p>classification scheme for [[treaties]] and suggests an alternate
methodology. The Section concludes by asserting that human rights
[[treaties]] can be clearly distinguished from other [[treaties]] based on their
subject matter and applies the proposed methodology to prove the
argument. Some [[treaties]] that seek to achieve multiple objectives or</p>
<p>that take a comprehensive approach to problem-solving might be
difficult to classify, but this Note is not concerned with such</p>
<p>borderline cases. The classification scheme described in this Note will</p>

<p>A [[treaty]] is in its nature a contract between two nations, not a legislative act. It

its operation is infra-territorial; but is carried into execution by the sovereign power

In the [[United]] [[States]] a different principle is established. Our constitution declares
a [[treaty]] to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of</p>

the aid of any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation import a

philosophy so much as a convenient fix for exigent circumstances.75</p>
<p>Indeed, the Court itself has on occasion rejected Marshall's
dichotomy. For example, in the Head Money Cases™ the Court
distinguished between contractual [[treaties]], which conferred no</p>
<p>individual rights, and statutory [[treaties]], which did.77 The Head Money
Cases dealt with the validity of an excise tax on immigrants - a tax</p>
<p>entrusted with the foreign intercourse of the nation . . . have unequivocally asserted
its rights of dominion over a country of which it is in possession, and which it claims
under a [[treaty]]; if the legislature has acted on the construction thus asserted, it is not in
its own courts that this construction is to be denied. A question like this respecting</p>
<p>the boundaries of nations, is, as has been truly said, more a political than a legal
question ....</p>

<p>Rauscher is not the only example of the Supreme Court
distinguishing [[treaties]] based on subject-matter classification. For
example, in considering whether certain provisions of the Jay [[Treaty]]
of [[1794]] between the [[United]] [[States]] and the [[United]] [[King]]dom survived
the [[War]] of [[1812]], the Court unanimously held: "The doctrine . . . that
war ipso facto annuls [[treaties]] of every kind ... is repudiated by the</p>
<p>great weight of modern authority; and the view now commonly
accepted is that 'whether the stipulations of a [[treaty]] are annulled by
war depends upon their intrinsic character.'"91 Specifically, the Court</p>
<p>distinguished [[treaties]] "having a political character" from those
dealing with substantive issues, such as possession of [[property]] by
nationals, boundary decisions, and "provisions which represent
completed acts."92 The Court ultimately distinguished [[treaty]] articles
vesting rights "permanent in character" which were "by their very</p>

<p>bargains, to speak of [[treaties]] as creating bargain
human beings seems offensive.95 Unfortunately,
courts have generally relied on Chief Justice Mar</p>
<p>rather than the substance of [[treaties]] to determine whether [[treaties]]</p>
<p>create individual rights. Sadly for both human rights activists and
potential torture victims, Marshall's dichotomy quite often has been
applied to human rights [[treaties]]. For example, a district court held
that the [[United]] Nations Charter was non-self-executing and therefore
did "not vest any of the plaintiffs with individual legal rights."96
Similarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR)97 has been found to be non-self-executing.98 Specifically
because of their non-self-executing nature, neither the ICCPR nor the
Convention Against Torture were deemed to have created "a private
right of action under which the plaintiffjs could] successfully state a</p>
<p>claim."99</p>
<p>In applying Marshall's dichotomy to human rights [[treaties]], courts
have created a quagmire of case law that is replete with exceptions.</p>
<p>For example, in evaluating the applicability of the Geneva</p>
<p>Conventions to General Manuel Noriega, a court noted that although
most international [[treaties]] have been found to be non-self-executing,</p>
<p>this determination must be made for each [[treaty]] individually.100

<p>Rather than relying on a structural analysis of whether a [[treaty]] is</p>
<p>self-executing, courts should use the content, substance, and purpose
of the [[treaty]] to determine whether [[treaties]] confer private, individual
rights. Human rights [[treaties]] are prime contenders for conferring
private rights based on their content and purpose because "[h]uman
rights conventions address the rights of individuals" by their very

<p>constitutional rights as marriage and procreation
need not be explicitly enumerated. If human righ
codify, rather than legislate, human rights derived</p>
<p>must be at least as judicially cognizable as nonenumerated
constitutional rights. Furthermore, jus cogens norms ought to be
recognized as a superior kind of right; it is logically inconceivable that
a court would protect the right to marry but turn a blind eye to more
funda[[mental]] threats to life and [[liberty]], such as torture.119</p>
<p>Additionally, a ratified [[treaty]] can be said to embody the
sovereign will of the [[United]] [[States]]. But such [[sovereignty]] "reside[s] in</p>
<p>the people, for whom the [[President]] and the Senate [are] merely</p>
<p>agents."120 At a minimum, then, human rights [[treaties]] should be able
to add to the rights and liberties enjoyed by [[America]]ns, similar to the
way in which other kinds of constitutive documents create obligations
and privileges. Rights deemed to be funda[[mental]], of course, include
not only limitations prohibiting certain [[government]] actions but also
positive [[government]] obligations.121</p>
<p>Given the Supreme Court's reluctance, until the [[1920]]s, to protect
civil liberties, and its current bent toward strict constructionism, it is</p>
<p>not surprising that the Court has failed to find many positive
obligations created by international human rights agreements.122 But</p>
<p>the Court's reluctance to do so, and the slow development of</p>
<p>domestic human rights jurisprudence generally, does not mean that
the Court should, or will, turn a blind eye to human rights claims in
the future - especially when such claims arise from [[treaties]].123 [[States]]
may be the actors that draft and ratify human rights agreements, but

<p>Although [[slavery]], also prohibited as a jus cogens norm, was embedded in, and perhaps

not be used to justify violating an analogous norm two hundred years later.</p>

<p>Finally, as consensus has developed that at least some
international human rights norms - jus cogens norms like torture and
genocide - do guarantee, at a minimum, the right to be free from the
activity prohibited, it is entirely appropriate for courts to recognize
such rights as coequal with constitutional rights.128 In Banco Nacional</p>
<p>de [[Cuba]] v. Sabbatino™ for example, the Court noted that "the

<p>Recognizing jus cogens norms as coequal with constitutional
rights would also be consistent with existing jurisprudence. Further,
such recognition would not run afoul of the Court's concerns that it

branches may send an even stronger signal.132</p>
<p>Finally, treating jus cogens norms as constitutional rights could</p>

<p>Although these principles originated with regard to criminal</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, the Court wants to avoid a m
opinion. One of the justifications for the Bus</p>
<p>strained definition of torture was that there was no international</p>
<p>consensus regarding the degree of suffering required to constitute
torture.167 But, if the Convention merely codified international law
and neither defined the offense nor legislated its prohibition, the</p>
<p>Court surely would be able to ascertain some definition of what
constitutes torture. After all, one Justice famously remarked</p>
<p>regarding obscenity, that he knew it when he saw it; surely torture
however difficult to define, is equally recognizable in the majority o
cases.168 And, if the [[Bush]] administration's definition conflicted wit
the commonly understood definition of torture, construing a human
rights [[treaty]] as vesting individual rights would provide the Court with</p>
<p>a clear rationale for rejecting the administration's definition. As th
arbiter of the meaning of constitutional rights, the judicial branch</p>
<p>and not the executive, should bear responsibility for, and asser
authority over, the interpretation of human rights [[treaties]].169
The [[Bush]] administration also claimed that a defense of</p>
<p>"necessity" justified contravening not just the Convention A
Torture, but also relevant domestic legislation.170 But the Co
itself indicates that "[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoe
may be invoked as a justification of torture."171 The Court sh

<p>the kind of judicially manageable standard found lacking in
Goldwater. Such an approach would give the Court a legitimate
reason to supersede either political branch's opinion while</p>
<p>simultaneously avoiding accusations of ideological or political bias.
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has opted for none of these
approaches to date. In [[2004]], in fact, it declined to interpret and apply</p>
<p>international human rights law, accepting the Senate's declaration
that the ICCPR is non-self-executing and therefore does not confer
any individual rights.173 Fortunately, the Court did not entirely close
the door to such an approach. It merely insisted that "any claim based
on the present-day law of nations . . . rest on a norm of international</p>
<p>character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a
specificity comparable to the features of ... 18th-century</p>
<p>paradigms"174 and noted that "the door is still ajar subject to vigilant
doorkeeping"175 and "independent judicial recognition of actionable</p>
<p>international norms."176</p>
<p>A decision that human rights [[treaties]], because of their unique
nature and function, should be treated differently from other [[treaties]],</p>
<p>and specifically that jus cogens norms deserve special status, would
allow the Court to constrain the executive without raising the fear of
an out-of-control judiciary.
