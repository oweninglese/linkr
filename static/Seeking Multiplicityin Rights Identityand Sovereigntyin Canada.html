struggles with citizenship are unique in this regard. Although these peoples
have long histories of exclusion from citizenship in places such as [[Canada]]
and the [[United]] [[States]], their political goals have always been about more
than equal access to the rights of other citizens. Their self-identification
as members of nations with rights of self-[[government]] distinguish their de

political communities (Ramirez [[2007]]).</p>
<p>In this article, I examine how one [[indigenous]] group negotiated and
defended a form of legally and conceptually differentiated citizenship in</p>
<p>[[Canada]]. I do this through an analysis of how the people of the Nisga'a
First Nation struggled for recognition of their [[aboriginal]] rights, including
the ability to control their membership criteria and call themselves "cit</p>
<p>izens of the Nisga'a nation," during recent [[treaty]] negotiations with the
federal and provincial [[government]]s. The Nisga'a have spent more than a
century seeking recognition of their [[aboriginal]] rights and title through a
[[treaty]]. Their territory lies along the Nass River valley in northwestern [[British]]</p>
<p>Columbia, where they historically fished, hunted, and [[trade]]d the rich re
sources provided by the river and its watershed. In 1[[998]], their negotiations

was being debated in the [[Canadian]] Parliament, in Vancou</p>
<p>ing entitlements, and rights to all surface and subsurface re</p>
<p>sources, including timber and minerals, on [[treaty]] lands.2
The [[treaty]] is a precedent in [[British]] Columbia because
it is the first [[treaty]] made in that province after more than</p>
<p>a century of provincial [[government]] refusal to acknowledge
that [[aboriginal]] people had rights to land. Nationally, it is the
first to include recognition of the right to self-[[government]]
as a [[treaty]] right per se; this is particularly significant be
cause [[treaty]] rights in [[Canada]] receive constitutional protec
tion and cannot be revoked by successor [[government]]s. At
the Nisga'a's insistence, the [[treaty]] also goes beyond the lan
guage of "member" or "participant" used in other modern
[[treaties]] and identifies the Nisga'a as citizens of the Nisga'a</p>
<p>nation.</p>
<p>Anthropologists have theorized citizenship as a status</p>
<p>whose criteria subaltern peoples challenge and contest as
they move toward full, rather than second-class, member</p>
<p>ship in states (Ramirez [[2007]]; Rosaldo [[1994]], [[1997]]). Schol
ars have also theorized citizenship as a category through
which people are disciplined into particular kinds of sub
jects even as they struggle with the terms of their belonging</p>
<p>(Ong [[1996]], [[2006]]; Rose and Novas [[2005]]). Nisga'a have fought
to redefine their citizenship so that it reflects their rights,</p>
<p>culture, and political goals in [[Canada]]. At stake is how much
they have been able to evade being disciplined by norma</p>
<p>tive criteria of belonging in the process (Ong [[1996]]:738).
In the pages that follow, I argue that Nisga'a have challenged
the hegemonic norms of citizenship for [[aboriginal]] people
in [[Canada]] by refusing to equate their [[Canadian]] citizenship
with the elimination of their [[aboriginal]] rights and identi
ties. They have sought an [[indigenous]] differentiated citizen
ship on the basis of rights that flow from their relationship
to their lands and their status as a preexisting political com
munity. In this respect, they have disrupted the state as the
sole source of rights and realigned the relationship between
their rights as [[aboriginal]] people and their relationship with
the [[Canadian]] state. The Nisga'a's struggle to invest citizen
ship with multiple content and legal rights also shows, how
ever, that although citizenship is a useful focal point for sub
altern groups trying to renegotiate their relationships with</p>
<p>states, it is fraught with hegemonic ideals of equality linked
with universal rights and modernist subjectivities that can</p>
<p>impede the political aspirations of those groups. Nisga'a
have challenged the legal, political, and cultural criteria
of their participation in [[Canada]] and continue to empha
size communal values and kin-based forms of belonging in
their communities. These emphases sit, however, in uneasy</p>
<p>ver, home to the Federal [[Treaty]] Negotiating Office, and in
the Nass River valley. In [[Ottawa]], I met and gained familiar
ity with a small community of negotiators and bureaucrats
working to get the [[treaty]] through the House of Commons
and Senate. The Nisga'a and the provincial and federal gov
ernments each had a [[treaty]] negotiating team. The provin
cial and federal teams were made up of employees from var
ious [[government]] departments, including the Departments
of [[Indian]] Affairs and Justice, as well as external consultants</p>
<p>working on contract. Many members of the federal team
worked out of the Federal [[Treaty]] Negotiating Office head</p>
<p>quarters in [[Vancouver]]. The Nisga'a team included elected
members of the Nisga'a Tribal Council, tribal-council em
ployees, and at least one non-Nisga'a lawyer. In the Nass, I
talked with Nisga'a [[treaty]] negotiators as well as community
members, elders, and others not directly involved in [[treaty]]
negotiations. Of the approximately 5,500 Nisga'a, half live
in the villages of [[New]] Aiyansh, Girwinksihlkw, Laxgalts'ap,</p>
<p>and Gingolx on Nisga'a lands (see Figure 1). The rest live
and work in towns and cities outside the Nass valley, in
cluding Terrace, Prince Rupert, and [[Vancouver]]. When the
[[treaty]] came into legal effect on [[May]] 11, [[2000]],1 was staying
in [[New]] Aiyansh. My most recent trip to the Nass occurred in</p>

<p>Citizenship and [[aboriginal]] people in [[Canada]]:
A [[history]] of exclusion
[[Aboriginal]] people have long experienced [[Canadian]] citizen
ship as something they could only acquire by giving up their</p>
<p>[[aboriginal]] identities and assimilating into non[[aboriginal]]
society (Battiste and Semaganis [[2002]]; Johnston [[1993]]). After</p>
<p>[[Canada]] became a country in [[1867]], politicians, administra
tors, and missionaries argued that [[aboriginal]] people had to
become "civilized" before they could take on the rights and
responsibilities of citizenship, including the franchise and
the ability to own [[property]]. The [[government]] also drafted
special legislation, known as the [[Indian]] Act, through which
it made [[aboriginal]] people wards of the state and authorized
itself to administer all aspects of their lives (Fiske [[1995]]). It</p>
<p>did this on the principle that [[aboriginal]] people were not
yet competent subjects and had to be protected until they
were assimilated into mainstream society, after which they
would no longer need special oversight. When an [[aboriginal]]
person was enfranchised, he or she was removed from the</p>
<p>[[Indian]] Act register and ceased to have any legal status as
an [[Indian]]. Although assimilation was the stated goal, in ac
tuality, the [[Indian]] Act facilitated the ongoing supervision of</p>

<p>the Nisga'a broke with other First Nations in the province
and took their case to the [[British]] Columbia Supreme Court
in [[1969]]. The risk they took was that a negative ruling would
make it impossible for any other First Nation to get politi
cal recognition of [[aboriginal]] title in [[British]] Columbia, a risk
that loomed large when they lost their case in the Supreme
Court and then again in the [[British]] Columbia Court of Ap
peal. In [[1973]], they took their case, known as Colder v. the
[[Attorney]] General of [[British]] Columbia, to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>of [[Canada]].</p>
<p>The ruling on this case was and continues to be a land</p>
<p>it could to block ratification, including launching a chal
lenge in the [[British]] Columbia Supreme Court, arguing that
the [[treaty]]'s self-[[government]] provisions violated the distri
bution of powers allowed for in the [[Canadian]] constitution.
The Nisga'a's lawmaking and self-governing authority, in
cluding authority over citizenship, were also heated issues
at the federal level. The [[treaty]] refers to Nisga'a "citizens,"
defines a Nisga'a citizen as "a citizen of the Nisga'a Nation
as determined by Nisga'a law," and sets out criteria of en
rollment that are based on ancestry ([[Canada]] et al. 1[[998]]:10).</p>
<p>the Nisga'a had [[aboriginal]] title in the past. Three ruled</p>
<p>In the Senate, this terminology and the powers the Nisga'a
would have to control their citizenship criteria served as an
entry point for discussion about the meaning of citizenship
and the merits of a common versus a differentiated one for</p>

<p>national identity, [[sovereignty]], equality, and social cohesion.</p>
<p>mark in [[aboriginal]]-rights jurisprudence in [[Canada]] (Asch
[[1999]]). Six of the seven Supreme Court justices found that</p>
<p>[[sovereignty]], and three ruled that it was not. The seventh jus</p>
<p>Bills are first introduced in the Senate chamber and</p>
<p>tice cited a technicality and abstained, creating a split rul
ing on extinguishment. The judgment in Colder affirmed</p>
<p>then sent to committees, where senators question wit
nesses on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed</p>
<p>that the Nisga'a had [[aboriginal]] title in the past and sug</p>
<p>legislation. They are then returned to the Senate for final de
bate and vote. Senators ultimately passed the [[treaty]] bill but
not without worrying that the [[treaty]] would weaken [[Canada]]</p>
<p>gested that [[aboriginal]] title still existed for the Nisga'a and</p>
<p>others who had not surrendered any of their territorial
rights to [[Canada]] in a [[treaty]]. The federal [[government]] quickly</p>
<p>established a Comprehensive Claims Policy to deal with
land claims where [[treaties]] had not been made, including
[[British]] Columbia, the [[Yukon]], [[Quebec]], and [[New]]foundland
and Labrador. All claims negotiated since then are known
as "modern" [[treaties]] or land-claims agreements. The fed
eral [[government]] also began negotiating with the Nisga'a.</p>
<p>The province of [[British]] Columbia did not join these ne
gotiations until [[1991]]. By this time, conflict between First</p>
<p>Nations and logging [[companies]] had become so disrup
tive that even those politicians and businesspeople who
had refused to acknowledge the existence of [[aboriginal]] ti
tle in [[British]] Columbia after Colder began to realize that the
provincial economy depended on settling [[aboriginal]] claims
(Blackburn [[2005]]).</p>
<p>Debating differentiated citizenship
After the Nisga'a and federal and provincial [[government]]s
signed the final agreement in 1[[998]], it had to be approved
by a majority of Nisga'a voters and ratified by the provin
cial and federal legislatures. This took two years. The politi
cal parties who supported the [[treaty]] held majorities in both
[[government]]s but were vigorously opposed by other parties
who argued that the [[treaty]] threatened the legal and polit
ical unity of [[Canada]], cost too much in land and cash, and
contradicted the democratic principle of equality before the</p>
<p>by foregrounding a heterogeneity in rights, sentiments, and
political identification that would make the country politi
cally less stable and conceptually more difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>One senator wondered why the words citizen and citizen
ship had to be used at all, arguing that they "give the im
pression that native people are leaving the country or some
how have different or special rights that may supersede the
rights of the rest of us." In the Senate Committee on Abo
riginal Affairs, this senator opined that [[Canadian]]s "want to
be equal" and "to be treated fairly and justly in this land.
There is the feeling that 'citizen' conjures up some special
rights in a way that diminishes others in the citizenship cat
egory. If they are citizens of Nisga'a, are they still citizens
of [[Canada]]? That is what I am being asked."3 Others worried
the [[treaty]] created a form of dual citizenship that would frag
ment the political cohesion and social unity a common cit
izenship should [[foster]]. People "are struggling to find some
unity in [[Canada]]" one senator said, in a veiled reference to
the threat of [[Quebec]] secession. "We rally around symbols
of citizenship."4 Another described citizenship as the coun
try's highest honor and cautioned against introducing any
duality into a term of such legal and symbolic significance.
A non[[aboriginal]] witness from a right-wing think tank sim</p>
<p>ilarly argued that [[aboriginal]] people should not have dif
ferent rights than other [[Canadian]]s because this "will work
against concepts of [[Canadian]] citizenship for the polity as a</p>
<p>whole" and "undermine all common [[Canadian]] citizenship</p>
<p>law (Blackburn [[2007]]). Some First Nations argued the op</p>
<p>values."5</p>
<p>posite position, which was that the [[treaty]] did not provide
enough land, rights, or self-governing power to the Nisga'a.
In [[British]] Columbia, anxiety around the [[treaty]] was partic
ularly high because approximately fifty other [[treaties]] were
to follow. The provincial opposition party did everything</p>
<p>As citizens of the Nisga'a nation, Nisga'a do have "dif
ferent or special rights" that other [[Canadian]]s do not, in
cluding rights to self-[[government]] and land. This is the point
of differentiated citizenship for [[aboriginal]] people; the dif
ferentiation rests on the principle that [[aboriginal]] rights are</p>

<p>inherent and temporally prior to the rights of nonaborigi
nal [[Canadian]]s. The Nisga'a's pursuit of this differentiation
and their use of the word citizen to label themselves chal</p>
<p>lenge the public expectation that citizenship means equal
rights; they also challenge the expectation that universality
in rights is part of the social contract whereby citizens have
equal entitlements and responsibilities in a shared or com
mon community (Ignatieff [[1995]]:70; Ong [[2006]]). Senators are
clearly well aware of this expectation. From the perspective
of the Nisga'a, however, the notion that citizenship means
equality in rights and [[treatment]] masks their historical ex
periences of discrimination, both before and after they at
tained the formal rights of [[Canadian]] citizenship. In their</p>
<p>experience, equality and inclusion in [[Canada]] have been
most notable in their absence, and their appropriation of
the term citizen involves a critique of such exclusions. Their
challenge is to keep and build on the word and some of what</p>
<p>it stands for in liberal political theory while investing citi
zenship with meaning specific to an [[indigenous]] politics and</p>
<p>[[indigenous]] resistance.
The Nisga'a who testified to the Senate committee ar
gued that citizen was the best word to signal their affilia
tion with the political community that is the Nisga'a nation.
They did not deny that the [[treaty]] meant they had different
rights but hastened to say that they sought a differentiated</p>
<p>citizenship within [[Canada]]. Many [[indigenous]] people think</p>
<p>Figure 2. Nisga'a lands signpost. Photo by C. Blackburn.</p>
<p>of themselves as dual citizens in ways that combine belong
ing to their [[aboriginal]] nations and the larger states in which</p>
<p>they live (Biolsi [[2005]]:251; Ramirez [[2004]]:401). In the com
mittee hearings one Nisga'a negotiator said,</p>
<p>lation, which was the [[Indian]] Act. It relegated you to status
as a member of a band in a confined reserve."</p>
<p>Nisga'a are drawing heavily on the linkage in lib
We do not understand why anyone would object to the
use of the term "citizen" to refer to the members of the</p>
<p>Nisga'a nation. No doubt, if we had agreed to describe
ourselves merely as members there would have been
little or no objection. We believe that the correct word
to describe someone who belongs to a nation is "citi
zen." We wish to affirm, not deny, our existence as the
Nisga'a nation, a nation that is within [[Canada]].6</p>
<p>Their lawyer added to this argument, saying that to deny
the Nisga'a the ability to use citizen was to deny "their ex
istence as a nation, as a nation within [[Canada]]." At stake,
he said, was not dual citizenship in the international-law
sense but, rather, recognition that the Nisga'a belonged to
a unique form of political community. He and others ex
plained that, although members belonged to voluntary or
ganizations, like clubs and even the Senate itself, this did
not suggest a political identity in the way that citizen did.7
The [[Indian]] Act also identifies [[aboriginal]] people as "mem
bers" of bands, and Nisga'a refused to repeat this terminol
ogy. "Band member," one negotiator told me, "meant there's</p>
<p>no such thing as self-definition. You were defined by legis</p>
<p>eral theory between citizenship and the modern nation
state to say that they were politically independent, self
governing people prior to the arrival of settlers (Hall and
Held [[1989]]:173; Turner [[1993]]:7). They are building on a term
of [[Western]], rather than [[indigenous]], political theory to make
an argument about their status as a nation. They are also in
vesting citizen with the significance of the relationship be
tween their rights and territory. When I asked a Nisga'a ne
gotiator why they had insisted on citizen, he said, ruefully,
that this really got the right-wingers going but that "the self</p>
<p>description as citizens is really a declaration that we've al
ways had this inherent connection to our land." There was</p>
<p>no other term to use "to make that connection." He spoke
of how the huwilp (sing, wilp), the matrilineal kin groups
to which all Nisga'a belong, are based on and embody an
cestral rights to territory that are distinct from [[Western]]
forms of [[property]] ownership. [[Aboriginal]] scholar John Bor
rows ([[1999]]:80) has called [[indigenous]] citizenship "landed
citizenship" to capture the importance of land to aborig
inal peoples' understanding of their rights and identity
(see Figure 2). In this respect, the citizenship Nisga'a claim
is different from the deterritorialized citizenships that are
linked with globalization and contemporary neoliberalism</p>

cally deployed but, rather, of an identity and rights rooted
in territory (Lee [[2006]]). In [[New]] Aiyansh, a woman who had
returned to Nisga'a territory after some years away affirmed</p>
<p>this a priori relationship to the land when she said, "I'm
a Nisga'a citizen first before I'm a [[Canadian]] citizen. We've
known all along that we belong here, in this place. If they
want to call this country where we are [[Canada]], then I'm also</p>
<p>a [[Canadian]] citizen."8</p>
<p>Citizenship, nationhood, and [[sovereignty]] are deeply in
tertwined and their contemporary rearticulations a focus of</p>
<p>to the lawmaking authority Nisga'a will have over their
citizenship:</p>
<p>They can't grant passports or entry into or out of
[[Canada]] or create citizens or take citizenship away
from anybody?[[Canadian]] citizenship. They can't do
any of that. The word that's used in the [[Indian]] Act
is member, and that's one significant reason why the</p>
<p>Nisga'a, and why we accepted, moving to a different
language_And so citizen was used. And I don't know
if it was a good use or bad use, I suppose it's academic at
this point because that's what it is. But it doesn't mean
more than if we had used the word member_It's used
in a way that does not in any way imply [[sovereignty]].</p>
<p>much scholarly inquiry (e.g., Hansen and Stepputat [[2005]];
Ong [[2006]]). Whereas Nisga'a link their right to call them
selves "citizens" with their status as a nation, politicians</p>
<p>[[sovereignty]] either, but they do see the term as doing more</p>
<p>wondered if the presence of a group of people with separate</p>
<p>than these comments suggest. Citizenship involves "a po</p>
<p>rights and calling themselves "citizens of the Nisga'a nation"</p>
<p>litical identity, an expression of one's membership in a po
litical community" as well as a set of rights (Kymlicka and</p>
<p>challenged [[Canada]]'s [[sovereignty]]. [[Treaty]] negotiators reas
sured everyone who asked that the [[treaty]] did not weaken
the federal [[government]]'s authority over [[Canadian]] citizen
ship or create an uncontrollable legal duality in the state.
One told the Senate committee that he only agreed to the
word citizen "because of how it is defined in the [[treaty]] and</p>
<p>because all of the rights that accrue to such a person are
specifically stated in the [[treaty]] and nothing exists outside</p>
<p>of it." He insisted that the powers the Nisga'a have over
their citizenship have nothing to do with the power to grant</p>
<p>[[Canadian]] citizenship and that nothing about Nisga'a citi
zenship produced dual citizenship in [[Canada]]. As he said,
"If someone comes to [[Canada]] legally and goes onto Nisga'a</p>
<p>lands and is made a citizen, whatever the federal law is</p>
<p>with respect to that person's ability to remain in [[Canada]] re
mains the law under which he or she is governed. That per
son has no special rights with respect to [[Canadian]] citizen
ship as a result of that." Nisga'a citizenship, he explained,
"relates to their lands, their assets, and living within their
territory."9</p>
<p>Others were more categorical that Nisga'a citizenship
did not threaten [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]]. One employee in
the federal Department of [[Indian]] Affairs responded to my
queries about citizenship by saying, "They can call them,</p>
<p>you know, coffee cups, but they called them Nisga'a citi
zens." Flipping through the [[treaty]], she explained, "It says
somewhere in here that this is not about nationhood_It's
not about the determination of citizenship in [[Canada]], and</p>
<p>the Nisga'a citizens are still citizens of [[Canada]] as well.
They're just also Nisga'a citizens, it's not really a dual pass</p>
<p>port situation, because a passport, you need a passport
to a nation, like to a sovereign nation, and this is not
about [[sovereignty]]." A member of the federal negotiating
team likewise told me that, although member would have</p>
<p>saved them a lot of trouble, citizen did not mean much
more than that. He explained that there are limitations</p>
<p>Nisga'a do not see citizen as implying this much</p>
<p>Norman [[1995]]:301). Nisga'a are using citizenship to signal
both of these things, insisting that they have rights as citi
zens of the Nisga'a nation not because of the racialized dif</p>
<p>ference generated by the state and linked, formerly, with
their exclusion but because they belong to a previously ex
isting political community that holds inherent or extracon
stitutional rights (Wilkins and Lomawaima [[2001]]). Nisga'a's
insistence on these rights and the ability to decide who gets
access to them challenges hegemonic practices that locate
citizenship in rights that are granted or denied by the state
(Gordillo [[2006]]:167). The converse argument, that all Cana
dians should have the same rights and be governed by the
same laws, presumes that [[Canadian]]s have rights that flow
only from their status as citizens of [[Canada]].
The [[treaty]] does not create the Nisga'a as sovereigns but</p>
<p>it does produce a novel kind of political space in [[Canada]]
(Biolsi [[2005]]). Nisga'a have decision and lawmaking power
over their lands, resources, and cash assets. They do not
have exclusive jurisdiction, but they do have paramount
jurisdiction?meaning their laws trump federal or provin
cial laws?in areas relating to Nisga'a [[government]], citizen
ship, language, and culture. Their self-governing powers
make them a unique configuration; they are more than a
municipality but less than a province. They are an "abo
riginal [[government]]," possibly best described as sui generis,
a thing in itself.10 Their right of self-[[government]] is written</p>
<p>into the [[treaty]] and thereby constitutionally recognized as
an [[aboriginal]] right. In [[treaty]] and land claims negotiations
before the Nisga'a Final Agreement, the federal [[government]]</p>
<p>insisted that self-[[government]] be negotiated in so-called
side agreements. This meant that the self-governing powers
of a First Nation were not part of the final [[treaty]], did not re</p>
<p>ceive constitutional protection, and provided the First Na
tion with a delegated form of authority akin to a municipal
ity. First Nations have been critical of the municipal model</p>

<p>of [[government]] for some time; municipalities have jurisdic
tional authority that is delegated by provincial or federal
[[government]]s and that can be changed or taken back at any
time. Nisga'a negotiators would not accept self-[[government]]
as a side agreement to the [[treaty]] because this would leave</p>
<p>[[child]], even if the person is not [[aboriginal]]. A person who is
a descendant of either of these categories is eligible for en
rollment. Lastly, a person may qualify for enrollment if he
or she marries a Nisga'a, is [[aboriginal]], and has been cultur</p>
<p>them in a similarly vulnerable position and because they</p>
<p>cols. A non[[aboriginal]] person who marries a Nisga'a and is
culturally adopted does not qualify for enrollment and cit</p>
<p>refused to accept that their right to self-[[government]] could</p>
<p>be "given" or "loaned" to them by the [[Crown]], as delegated
authority implies.</p>
<p>Genealogies of belonging: Kin or contract in the</p>
<p>making of citizens</p>
<p>The [[treaty]]'s citizenship criteria distinguish between peo
ple who live on Nisga'a lands and are Nisga'a citizens and
those who may live on Nisga'a lands but may not qual
ify as Nisga'a citizens. Only Nisga'a citizens are entitled
to the [[treaty]] rights, to fish, for example, or to participate</p>
<p>in self-[[government]] by voting in Nisga'a elections. Crit
ics argued that the [[treaty]] was a set of race-based rights
and railed against the establishment of ethnic enclaves on
[[Canadian]] soil. Some senators were uncomfortable with the
ethical and political implications of having a governing en
tity within [[Canada]] that did not practice universal citizen
ship. How, they asked, could the Senate sanction the for
mation of a [[government]] that would base its membership,</p>
<p>and the ability to vote, on ancestry? Some compared the
use of ancestral or "birthright" criteria for Nisga'a citizen
ship with the [[government]]'s former use of blood to define</p>
<p>ally adopted according to Nisga'a cultural adoption proto</p>
<p>izenship; such persons cannot vote and have no access to
the [[treaty]] rights. Non[[aboriginal]] people who live on Nisga'a
lands for short periods, such as schoolteachers or police of</p>
<p>ficers, cannot become Nisga'a citizens and cannot vote in
Nisga'a elections.
Nisga'a defended the link between matrilineal ancestry
and citizenship as culturally appropriate and a positive act
of self-[[government]]. The ability to determine membership is
funda[[mental]] to [[indigenous]] self-determination, particularly
because settler [[government]]s have so long arrogated this re
sponsibility to themselves (Jaimes [[1992]]). A tribal-council
employee who worked on the citizenship criteria explained
that they were crafted to reflect Nisga'a cultural practices</p>
<p>and to be as distinct from [[Indian]] Act definitions as pos
sible, meaning the [[Indian]] Act's former blood requirement
and its emphasis on tracing [[Indian]] status through men. Un</p>
<p>til [[1985]] [[aboriginal]] women in [[Canada]] who married nona
boriginal men lost their legal status as [[Indian]]s, as did their</p>
<p>[[child]]ren, whereas non[[aboriginal]] women who married In
dian men acquired [[Indian]] status (Jamieson [[1977]]). Now, as
this Nisga'a individual explained, "Nisga'a criteria for en
rolment begins with a person's mother," so even if a person's</p>
<p>who was an [[Indian]]. Until [[1951]], an [[Indian]] in [[Canada]] was</p>
<p>mother married a non-Nisga'a, that person would still be</p>
<p>"any male person of [[Indian]] blood reputed to belong to
a particular band," "any [[child]] of such person," and "any
woman who is or was lawfully married to such person"
(Jamieson [[1978]]:43). Referring to the possibility that the
Nisga'a could embarrass the state by repeating its previ
ous legal reification of race through blood, one senator
noted that the [[Indian]] Act began "a racial blood defini
tion" but that now it was possible to have "this unbeliev</p>
<p>entitled to enroll. He said this "corrects some hardships" but</p>
<p>able paradox that the reprehensible notion of blood in the
definition of the [[Indian]] Act, which was [[Europe]]an and for</p>
<p>"also... make[s] sure that what happened with the [[Indian]]
Act never happens again."
It is not surprising that senators read ancestry as
blood, given the taken-for-grantedness of blood in Anglo
[[America]]n kinship reckoning and the linkage [[government]]s</p>
<p>have made between blood quantum and [[Indian]] identity
in the law (Turner Strong and Van Winkle [[1996]]). Senators</p>
<p>and witnesses who spoke to the committee also worried
that the ancestral linkage used in the citizenship criteria</p>
<p>eign to the [[aboriginal]]s, may somehow continue on in this</p>
<p>precluded universality in rights within the Nisga'a nation.</p>
<p>[[treaty]]."11</p>
<p>What began as a concern about blood became a discus</p>
<p>Blood has a long [[history]] in the racialization of aborig
inal people in [[North]] [[America]] but is not a criterion for cit</p>
<p>sion about whether the Nisga'a really grasped the commit
ment to equality, minority rights, and democratic principles
that citizenship is supposed to entail. A witness from the</p>
<p>izenship in the Nisga'a nation (cf. Biolsi [[1995]]; Halualani
[[2001]]). Enrollment in the Nisga'a nation and access to the</p>
<p>organization Citizens Voice on [[Native]] Claims argued that</p>
<p>[[treaty]] rights does, however, depend on ancestry. A person
may be enrolled, according to the [[treaty]], if he or she can
show that his or her mother was Nisga'a and belonged to
one of the four Nisga'a pdeek, or tribes. Nisga'a are matri
lineal in their kinship reckoning. For enrollment purposes, a
person's qualifying Nisga'a mother can be on either the ma
ternal or paternal side and as far back as five generations.</p>
<p>the "closed membership society" the Nisga'a wanted went
against the grain of the last two centuries of evolution in
[[Western]] political thought,12 and the spokesperson from the
conservative think tank cited "the evidence of [[history]] and
all logic and reason and the development of western polit
ical thought" to critique the [[treaty]]'s membership criteria.13
Senator Grafstein, a Liberal senator from [[Ontario]], was par</p>

<p>ticularly vocal on this issue. He linked universal citizenship</p>

<p>rights with the principles of modern democracy in a way
that questioned the Nisga'a's commitment to the latter. He
asked the Nisga'a why they did not provide "something that
we consider to be important in so-called [[Europe]]an style of
governance, and that is to establish or entrench minority
rights within the institutions."14 Grafstein raised the twin
specters of tribalism and ethnic primordialism, asking if
nonuniversal citizenship is "the vision we want for a united
[[Canada]] with the globe shrinking in the twenty-first century?
We have yet to learn the bitter lessons of the twentieth cen
tury respecting the clash between ethnicity on the one hand</p>
<p>and open citizenship on the other."15 He said the Nisga'a
seem to have wanted to move from a purely "tribal sys</p>
<p>Senator Grafstein's response to this is illustrative: He
took issue with the family analogy, and he suggested that</p>
<p>the assets in question come from [[Canada]]. "These are not
family assets," he said. "These are public assets that are
held in trust as fiduciaries. What I am talking about here is</p>
<p>the right of a citizen to fully participate and vote on mat
ters affecting his life and the area in which he chooses to</p>

<p>Nisga'a and federal and provincial negotiators ex</p>
<p>the Nisga'a. If non[[aboriginal]] people could become citi</p>

<p>zens and vote in Nisga'a elections, they could in[[flu]]ence the</p>
<p>found themselves being criticized for not being modern
enough. Implicit in the canonical narrative of moderniza
tion is evolution up and away from social groupings and</p>
<p>management and distribution of those assets. Negotiators
also argued that the lawmaking authority of Nisga'a gov
ernment pertains mostly to Nisga'a citizens, so that non
[[aboriginal]] people living on Nisga'a lands are not actually
governed very much by the Nisga'a. Most significantly, if
non[[aboriginal]] people could enroll under the [[treaty]] and be
Nisga'a citizens, they would then have access to the [[treaty]]
rights of the Nisga'a people, rights that are a subset of the
[[aboriginal]] rights recognized and protected in section 35 of
the [[Canadian]] constitution. These rights come from aborigi
nal peoples' presence as self-governing communities before
[[Canada]] became a country; they are not the universal enti
tlements of all [[Canadian]]s (Borrows [[2001]]). When the presi
dent of the Nisga'a Tribal Council defended the particularity
of Nisga'a rights, he reflected the conviction that the [[treaty]]
rights and assets are the ancestral inheritance of the Nisga'a
people. Using an idiom of kinship that did not resonate well
in the Senate, he said,</p>
<p>relationships built around kin, custom, or tribe toward au
tonomy, individualism, and relationships based on modern
legal forms, of which contract is preeminent (Coombe 1[[998]];
Perry [[1995]]:561; Turner [[1993]]). Senator Grafstein's reference
to "tribal systems" and his urging of the Nisga'a to go that
"next step" suggest these distinctions. In this trajectory, the
modern citizen emerges as "an abstract political subject no
longer formally confined by the particularities of birth, eth
nicity or gender" (Turner [[1990]]:194). Attachments based on
blood, language, or religion are to be replaced by an enlight
enment model of modern political participation based "on
the idea of an educated, post-ethnic, calculating individual,
subsisting on the workings of the free market and partici
pating in a genuine civil society" (Appadurai [[1996]]:142-143).
This placement of the Nisga'a on the margins of moder</p>
<p>nity is not new but, rather, has long been made in con
junction with the criteria of citizenship and belonging for</p>
<p>By way of comparison, would any one of you seated

or three years and then they are gone_Would you al

<p>Nisga'a and other First Nations in [[Canada]]. Indeed, it has
corresponded with the state's previous exclusion of abo
riginal people from citizenship. The Senate debate was an
other instance in the long conversation about Nisga'a peo
ple's suitability as [[Canadian]] citizens. It took the form it did
because, in their defense of ancestral membership criteria,
the Nisga'a suggest that they have not given up the kinds of
tribal affiliations that originally marked them as not mod
ern, not yet ready for [[Canadian]] citizenship and in need of</p>

<p>assimilation. Although the federal [[government]] has repudi
ated its former policy of assimilation, there remains an ex</p>
<p>pectation that, to be a citizen, one must be recognizably
"modern" in the sense of understanding the importance
of equality, the rule of law, and upholding the values of
democratic society (Ignatieff [[1995]]:55). While Nisga'a defend
their right to control their citizenship criteria as an empow
ering act of self-[[government]], they insist on enacting self</p>
<p>[[government]] in ways that complicate the presumed asso
ciation between evolved, democratic forms of governance
and the universality in rights that is supposed to replace
particularism (Ignatieff [[1995]]; Young [[1995]]). For their polit
ical opponents, this casts doubt on their capacity for self
[[government]] and the suitability of the form of citizenship
they seek within [[Canada]].</p>
<p>Citizenship and self-[[government]]
During the committee hearings, one senator asked if the
Nisga'a had a word for citizen that could be used instead of
the symbolically loaded English one. She speculated that, if
there was such a word, there also must be a set of rights and
responsibilities that flowed from it.23 In response, the presi
dent of the Nisga'a Tribal Council said,</p>
<p>contributions to feasts at one another's marriage and [[death]].
In the past, if someone wanted to pass through or hunt, fish,
or collect berries on the ango'oskw of another wilp, that per
son had to ask permission of the sim'oogit. If the person did
not and was caught, he or she could be [[kill]]ed or taken into
[[slavery]]. This seldom happened because people were, on the</p>
<p>whole, taught to respect the laws governing trespass and ac
cess to territories. People who had no relatives and did not
know their origins were way'aayin, meaning "not whole"</p>
<p>or "not healed," because they had no one to look after
them.
In her analysis of cultural citizenship, Aiwha Ong asks
"if a minority group can escape the cultural inscription of
state power and other forms of regulation that define modes</p>
<p>of belonging within states" ([[1996]]:738). Ong theorizes cul
tural citizenship as a disciplinary process that involves mak
ing people into particular kinds of subjects within nation
states. Others have formulated cultural citizenship as the
attempt by minorities to bring their cultural difference into
their participation in mainstream society and institutions</p>
<p>(Rosaldo [[1994]], [[1997]]). Nisga'a have resisted much of the in
dividualizing thrust of state assimilation policies and invest
their citizenship in the Nisga'a nation, and, therefore, their</p>
<p>citizenship in [[Canada]], with social content that has long</p>
<p>been considered inimical to the attributes of modern citi
It is important for the committee and the rest of the</p>
<p>honorable senators who are not present to recognize
very clearly that every citizen of our nation today be
longs to one of the four major crests that we hold. There</p>
<p>is no Nisga'a today that is born who does not belong to
one of these four groupings of clans. Everyone fits into
our structure. There is no individual standing off to one
side who has nowhere to go. You belong. You are born
into a lineage. You are born into our nation.24</p>
<p>The president did not give an answer about indi
vidual rights but about belonging tied to kinship and
birth. All Nisga'a are members of one of four exoga
mous pdeek, also called "tribes," including Ganada (Raven
Frog), Laxgibuu (Wolf-Bear), Gisk'aast (Killerwhale-Owl),
and Laxsgiik (Eagle-Beaver). The pdeek are identified by
their two major crests and constitute the four [[corn]]er posts</p>
<p>of the Nisga'a nation. Each one is composed of matri
lineally defined huwilp, or houses. Members of a pdeek
are descended from a common ancestor but cannot trace
their descent to one woman; members of a wilp, however,
can. A wilp is named after its highest-ranking sim'oogit,
or hereditary chief. Children belong to the wilp of their
mother and have access to territories, known as ango'oskws,
through this matrilineal affiliation. They also have rights to
ango'oskws through their father, who belongs to a different
wilp and pdeek. A person's father's wilp is that person's wilk
silaks. People in the same wilksilaks perform specific ser
vices for one another throughout life and make important</p>
<p>zenship. Although they have been subjected to disciplinary
intervention on the part of state and church, they continue
to value forms of personhood that emphasize kin-based so</p>
<p>cial obligations and collective responsibilities. Nisga'a dis
tinguish this collectivism from the individualism of non</p>
<p>Nisga'a, describing the [[white]] world, in particular, as cold
and lacking support. "It's harder to be a [[white]] person," one</p>
<p>man said to me. "The support is not there." He explained
how, for him,
ultimately what it comes down to is, I'm not by myself.</p>
<p>I saw this especially when my uncle died. There was
a lot of fear when he passed away, because all his re
sponsibilities were ours now.... But when I went to our
tribal feast and I saw the strength of our house, I knew I
wasn't by myself. Halfway through, I knew it was going
to be okay. We had lost a significant member but what
he taught us was there.</p>
<p>After the Senate debate was over, I attended a stone
moving feast in [[New]] Aiyansh. Traditionally, a stone-moving
feast is held one year after a person's [[death]]. It marks the
movement of the headstone from display in front of the
house of a relative to the actual gravesite. It is also usually</p>
<p>the time when the deceased's Nisga'a name is passed on
to a successor. High-ranking names are the [[property]] of the
wilp and are linked with rights to territory as well as crests,</p>
<p>songs, and dances. The host wilp, in this case, the wilksi
laks of the person taking on the name, conducts a range</p>

<p>of business during the feast, including giving other names,
settling financial accounts, and, occasionally, performing a
cultural adoption, known as a "taking in." At the feast I at
tended, elders from the hosting wilp called a [[white]] man who
worked for the Nisga'a Tribal Council to the front of the hall
to take him into their wilp and pdeek. When I asked a se
nior woman about the procedure and its significance, she
said the person being taken in really wanted to be involved
in the community and that, to do so, he had to become part
of the tribal system. Once this happens, she explained, "you
are part of an extended family. You have obligations to them</p>
<p>and share the good times and the sad times. You have to
be there for the feasts, doing your part." People who have
been taken in and failed in their obligations can be publicly</p>
<p>censured, and Nisga'a complained that many nonaborigi</p>
<p>creasingly defined as the duty of individuals "to reduce their</p>
<p>burden on society," to maximize their individual capital
and be "entrepreneurs of themselves" (Ong [[1996]]:739). How
ever, although Nisga'a's commentary on their loss of self
reliance brings them into proximity with neoliberal norms</p>
<p>of citizenship?standards by which they have been and
continue to be adversely judged?they are not just recapitu
lating a neoliberal rationality in their self-critique. They are
commenting on the dilemmas facing them in light of their</p>
<p>disciplining out of interdependence and into dependency
and on the desirability of the market-oriented, individual
istic subjectivity that continues to have disciplinary force,
ideologically as well structurally. Nisga'a want to generate</p>
<p>wealth on their lands and reduce the economic impover</p>
<p>framed by the obligations that kinship and marriage pro
duce within and across huwilp and pdeek, they often talk
about what they have lost as a result of state- and church</p>
<p>ishment in their communities at the same time that they
challenge the norms of wealth and [[poverty]] that are domi
nant in non[[aboriginal]] society, and they worry about what
kind of cultural compromises they will have to make given
that they are surrounded by non[[aboriginal]] society and in
stitutions. Why, Nisga'a have recently asked me, do we con

society, by the state apparatuses that have regulated their
lives. When Nisga'a talked about their parents' and grand
parents' generations, they described lives of hard work, so
cial responsibility, and interdependence within the frame
work of the wilp and pdeek and linked this way of life with
their former practice of self-[[government]]. They complained
that the younger generations have become too dependent</p>
<p>ity for citizenship but also about what their internal norms
of citizenship behavior should be; these debates take place</p>
<p>nal people do not understand how hard it is to fulfill the du
ties of this particular kind of citizenship.</p>
<p>At the same time that Nisga'a conduct lives that are</p>
<p>around issues such as whether to move into a system of
fee-simple [[property]] ownership in their villages, how non
Nisga'a should behave to be taken in, and how to stimulate
economic development. At issue is the extent to which, at
the point of achieving [[aboriginal]] self-[[government]], Nisga'a
are required to govern themselves in the neoliberal sense of
being self-regulating, self-disciplining individuals.</p>
<p>on [[government]] assistance. Most blamed the [[Indian]] Act,
which dates to [[1876]], and the introduction of [[welfare]] in the
[[1950]]s for their loss of self-reliance, self-[[government]], and in</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>terdependence, saying that, when [[welfare]] was brought in,
the elders warned them that people would forget how to
work. People reserved their most contemptuous comments
for the [[Indian]] Act, describing it as suffocating, oppressive,
destructive, archaic, and regressive and as something that
restricted their movement and prescribed what they had
to do on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. "Over time,"
one woman said, "we became helpless," so that "when the
[[treaty]] came about and the reality was there for us to be self
governing, lo and behold, our people are a dependent peo
ple." She and others spoke of being stuck in an [[Indian]] Act
[[mental]]ity and of needing to deprogram themselves so they
could become "[[health]]y, thinking people" again.</p>
<p>The Nisga'a's pursuit of differentiated citizenship has im
portant implications for the study of citizenship as a place
from which to claim rights, responsibilities, and identities
in liberal democracies. This is because Nisga'a have experi
enced both coercive exclusion and coercive inclusion in and</p>
<p>This talk of dependency is significant because depen
dency is generally cast as antithetical to the responsibili
ties of citizenship in capitalist societies (Fraser and Gor
don [[1997]]). Those who make claims on the state are judged
negatively in relation to those who manage to pull them
selves up by their bootstraps. This is not new, but in the
current ascendancy of neoliberalism, good citizenship is in</p>
<p>in are inseparable from these histories. That [[aboriginal]] peo
ple assert rights to self-[[government]] and self-determination
makes their legal and political goals distinct from those of
other minorities. It also makes their claims more challeng</p>
<p>around the category of "citizen" and because of their politi
cal objectives. In [[Canada]], [[aboriginal]] people were denied the
civil, political, and social rights of other [[Canadian]]s because
they were seen as insufficiently civilized, and [[government]]s
and churches worked to transform them into the kind of in</p>
<p>dividuals who could become citizens. Their contemporary
struggles to assert citizenship in their [[indigenous]] nations
and to define if and how to be citizens of the states they live</p>
<p>ing to states, heightening what is at stake in the reconfigu
ration of the rights, identities, and governing authority con</p>
<p>nected with citizenship.</p>

<p>[[America]]n Ethnologist Volume 36 Number 1 [[February]] [[2009]]</p>
<p>At the Senate hearings, one Nisga'a negotiator said,
"The word citizen does not have a single fixed meaning
in every context in which it is properly used."25 Stuart
Hall and David Held make a similar point when they write
that citizenship, "like all key contested political concepts</p>
<p>of our time... can be appropriated within very different
political discourses and articulated to very different polit</p>
<p>ical positions" ([[1989]]:174). Nisga'a have insisted that they
are citizens of [[Canada]] through their citizenship in the
Nisga'a nation, using the words citizen and nation purpose
fully to signal that they are not just one more element in</p>
<p>[[Canada]]'s multicultural mosaic. Although they have strug
gled for cultural citizenship as the right to be culturally dif</p>
<p>ferent while belonging to [[Canadian]] society (Rosaldo [[1994]]),
they have also insisted on a legally differentiated citizen
ship on the basis of their inherent rights as [[aboriginal]] peo</p>
<p>ple (Young [[1995]]). Nisga'a have used "citizen" and "nation"
as tools of identity and struggle in ways that have chal
lenged the normative force of these concepts; they have
also disrupted the relationship between citizenship, nation
hood, and [[sovereignty]]. They have done this without link
ing either citizenship or nationhood to [[sovereignty]] in its
strongest sense, and it is clear that Nisga'a faced consider
able limitations in this regard. The [[treaty]] detaches Nisga'a
nationhood from [[sovereignty]] but it also means that Cana
dian [[sovereignty]] is not linked, monolithically, to an undif
ferentiated citizenry, because Nisga'a bring their rights as
Nisga'a citizens into their rights as [[Canadian]] citizens.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of [[aboriginal]] people to explore
all possible reconfigurations of [[sovereignty]] and the spaces
within it. Nisga'a have created a novel political space within</p>
<p>[[Canada]]. In the nature of its jurisdiction and source of au
thority, it is unlike a municipal, provincial, or federal order
of [[government]]. Their [[government]] is distinct and changes</p>
<p>the relationship they have with the [[Canadian]] state, and
Nisga'a welcome their transition from being an [[Indian]] Act
band to a nation with [[government]]al decision-making abil
ities that do not require oversight from the Department of
[[Indian]] Affairs. They rightly celebrate autonomy and self
[[government]] but are faced with the difficulty of what that</p>
<p>can and should look like now that the [[treaty]] is in place.
They do this while elements of citizenship, [[sovereignty]], and
identity are disarticulated and recombined in multiple con
texts around the globe. What it is to be self-governing cit
izens of the Nisga'a nation will emerge in ongoing contes
tation and struggle as Nisga'a live the rights the [[treaty]] now</p>
<p>protects.</p>
<p>also thank the many people involved with or affected by the [[treaty]]</p>
<p>who shared their time and knowledge with me. I am particularly
grateful to lane Collier, Gaston Gordillo, and the two anonymous

<li>There is no direct translation for citizen. A Nisga'a language
teacher suggested that hligadihl Nisga'a?meaning "the people of
the Nisga'a," or "the Nisga'a people"?might work, but she could
not think of anything "that says citizen." She said, in the past, what
people were called depended on where they lived on the Nass River.</li>
