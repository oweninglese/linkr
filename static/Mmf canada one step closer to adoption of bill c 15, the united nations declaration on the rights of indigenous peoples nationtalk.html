<p>[[Winnipeg]], MB, in the Métis Nation Homeland – Bill C-15 has passed the third reading in the Senate, leaving Royal Assent as the final step in the bill becoming law.</p>
<p>Bill C-15 requires the Government of [[Canada]], in consultation and collaboration with [[Indigenous]] Peoples, to develop an action plan and align federal laws with The [[United]] Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples (UNDRIP).</p>
<p>“With the passing of Bill C-15 through its third reading in Senate, we affirm our nation-to-nation, [[government]]-to-[[government]] relationship with [[Canada]] and our place in the constitution,” said David Chartrand, [[President]] of the [[Manitoba]] Metis Federation (MMF). “Bill C-15 ensures we have the standing to work in harmony with political leaders and industry, while protecting our environment and the land we were born to. Our work with Enbridge is a good example of the positive outcomes that can come from consultation, creating economic opportunities within our communities.”</p>
<p>UNDRIP affirms the human rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples across the globe, and complements the work being done in [[Canada]] to advance truth and reconciliation. The Métis Nation has participated in ongoing consultation with the Government of [[Canada]], the Assembly of First Nations and the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami in the development of this legislation. UNDRIP is an important instrument of international law, and it holds a great deal of promise for the Métis Nation. It presents a strong vision for the human rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples, built on a foundation of meaningful self-determination.</p>
<p>“The pathway to reconciliation for Métis Nation means taking our rightful place in [[Canada]]’s Confederation, and UNDRIP supports that,” said [[President]] Chartrand. “It makes it very clear that the duty to consult will be respected and that collaboration with the MMF on matters that affect the Homeland and Citizens will remain a key part of the process. Dialogue and consultation are vital if we truly want to see healing between [[Canada]] and the Métis Nation. It’s only by working together that we can create a better [[Canada]] for all our [[child]]ren.”</p>
