<p>Publishing by request: This is the speech I gave at the Melbourne Anarchist 
Bookfair on the 12/8/17, complete with adlibs and edits included on the day. I 
want to thank the MAB for giving me this space and to all the wonderful people 
who attended on the day. In solidarity - CL</p>

<p>Before I begin, I would like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the lands 
on which we meet today: The Wurrundjeri people of the Kulin Nation. I would like
to acknowledge their ancestors and pay my respects to their elders; past, 
present and future. I would also like to state that the Wurrundjeri have never 
ceded their [[sovereignty]] and that we are on Stolen Lands for which a [[treaty]] or 
sovereign agreement has never been negotiated. I therefore wish to acknowledge 
the victims of massacres, rapes, land clearings and other such [[government]]al 
policies and I call for the due acknowledgement of these atrocities and for 
compensation to be paid.</p>
<p>I also introduce myself as an Arrernte woman whose lands include Alice Springs 
and a good portion of the surrounding area. I come from an area of “caterpillar 
dreaming” and this is evident through the unique shapes of the McDonnell Ranges 
which surround Alice Springs, stretching out in all directions. I acknowledge my
grandparents: Harold Liddle and Emily Perkins who are both kwementyaye (or no 
longer with us) of which my father was their 7^th [[child]]. I also though 
acknowledge my mother’s side of the family who are non-[[Indigenous]] staunch 
working class people who made up some of the first mad Collingwood supporters in
Melbourne. My grandfather worked for the Carlton [[United]] Brewery for around 40 
years, as did many of my extended family. </p>
<p>Finally, I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the news yesterday of the sad 
demise of the Recognise campaign. Many in the community are going to miss the 
partnerships with human rights abusers such as Transfield and nearly every 
[[mining]] [[company]], the faulty survey results released to the media stating that 87%
of [[Aboriginal]] would vote yes to be recognised in the invader constitution 
despite there being no decisions at that point about what we’d actually be 
voting on, and the fact that the [[government]] spent millions on a campaign 
designed to assimilate us and negate our sovereign rights while concurrently 
cutting half a billion dollars from our [[health]], legal, and educational 
programmes and further diminishing native title. I think we should have a minute
silence to remember Recognise....</p>
<p>So I’m not good at off-the-cuff unless I am speaking to mob and I apologise for 
that. The title of my talk today was deliberately provocative and there are many
reasons behind it. For starters though, I wanted to point out that when I first 
started my blog and had my first article published by Fairfax not six weeks 
later, I had never heard of the term “intersectionality”. As my writing 
continued to be published, demand continued to rise and I suddenly seemed to 
gain traction though, I started seeing myself referred to as an “intersectional 
feminist”. </p>
<p>So how was it even remotely possible that I could go from not even hearing about
a concept to becoming some sort of expert on it? I hate to say it, but initially
it was actually a more socially-acceptable form of [[racism]] along with a 
simplistic narrative around class. I was intersectional merely because I ticked 
several boxes of oppression due to my race, sex and gender, and my class 
background so it was a way of naming, and at times “othering” my politics. </p>
<p>The thing is though, I have never had any other way to conceptualise the world. 
I’ve never been anything else but [[Aboriginal]] and if I had the hide to forget it 
at times through my own perceived knowledge and achievements, I was dutifully 
reminded by someone. I have never been anything except for a woman and girl and 
though I actively rebelled as a younger one against what I felt were the 
trappings of forced femininity, again society would tend to pull me back into 
place. And not only do I come from a working class family, but I have been 
independent from the time I was 18 years old and mainly funded myself through 
uni working and accumulating massive student loans which I only really paid back
a few years ago. So my life experience is drawn from this, as are my base 
politics and it has been via my interactions with others as well as through my 
journeys in higher education where I developed the language to express these 
ideas and experiences. </p>
<p>So if I was going to be framed as an intersectional feminist, I had to work out 
what the hell that meant to me. It could not be as simple as being othered as a 
radical left voice who is also [[Aboriginal]] and a woman. It could not be as 
offensive as a way of further marginalising the marginalised voices in this 
country. But it also could not dissolve into shallow identity politics where the
ultimate prize goes to the person who can identify as many groups outside the 
social default of [[white]], wealthy, heterosexual, able-bodied, middle-aged men. 
Because it’s never a prize. It’s a radical politics of [[liberation]] based on the 
principle that the advancement of those on the bottom rungs of society ends up 
benefiting others because to do so requires the bottom-up systematic dismantling
of the structures which oppress.</p>
<p>My first clue about intersectional thought came not from reading massive chunks 
of texts about the kyriarchy or other terms which I’d also never heard of, but 
from two simple passages from the Combahee River Collective Statement<a href="http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html" title="link">3</a>. This 
statement was written by a group of radical black lesbians including the likes 
of Audre Lorde; a woman famous for also coining the phrase “the master’s tools 
will never dismantle the master’s house”. The first passage is the introduction 
and goes as follows:</p>
<p>We are a collective of Black feminists who have been meeting together since 
[[1974]]. <a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zpyeeQoEQEI/WZlMS6ivGpI/AAAAAAAAAfI/gthTGDUkyFsJsQ9VYEW5KtWzMKx8uXDLwCLcBGAs/s[[1600]]/Anarchist-Bookfair-1080-624x866.jpg" title="link">1</a> During that time we have been involved in the process of defining and 
clarifying our politics, while at the same time doing political work within our 
own group and in coalition with other progressive organizations and movements. 
The most general statement of our politics at the present time would be that we 
are actively committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual, and 
class oppression, and see as our particular task the development of integrated 
analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression 
are interlocking. The synthesis of these oppressions creates the conditions of 
our lives. As Black women we see Black feminism as the logical political 
movement to combat the manifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of 
color face.</p>
<p>The second passage reads as follows and struck me in particular due to its final
sentence:</p>
<p>In "A Black Feminist's Search for Sisterhood," Michele Wallace arrives at this 
conclusion:</p>
<p>We exists as women who are Black who are feminists, each stranded for the 
moment, working independently because there is not yet an environment in this 
society remotely congenial to our struggle—because, being on the bottom, we 
would have to do what no one else has done: we would have to fight the world. 
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zpyeeQoEQEI/WZlMS6ivGpI/AAAAAAAAAfI/gthTGDUkyFsJsQ9VYEW5KtWzMKx8uXDLwCLcBGAs/s320/Anarchist-Bookfair-1080-624x866.jpg" title="image">2</a></p>
<p>Wallace is pessimistic but realistic in her assessment of Black feminists' 
position, particularly in her allusion to the nearly classic isolation most of 
us face. We might use our position at the bottom, however, to make a clear leap 
into [[revolution]]ary action. If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone
else would have to be free since our freedom would necessitate the destruction 
of all the systems of oppression.</p>
<p>And there I had it: the idea that true intersectionality is a [[revolution]]ary 
movement. That it was based in the analysis of structural rather than individual
oppression. And if I was going to be labelled as an “intersectional feminist” 
then I damn well hoped it was the type that configured my theories in these 
particular ways. </p>
<p>There are obviously a couple of problems with taking this statement and passage 
as a starting point from my perspective. For starters, blackness in the context 
of this landmass forcibly called [[Australia]] in an act of historical erasure via 
the declaration of terra nullius is interwoven with Indigeneity. Yes, there are 
other black people in this country and their experiences of [[racism]] in this 
country have been abhorrent. But all beyond the [[Aboriginal]] and Torres Strait 
Islander people benefit from the denial of [[sovereignty]] of First Peoples and this
is the reality, regardless of how people found themselves here. Hell, as an 
Arrernte living on Wurrundjeri lands, I too am a beneficiary of these genocidal 
practices while concurrently being a victim of them elsewhere in this country 
and this is the core reason why I have long dedicated myself to the [[Indigenous]] 
struggle.</p>
<p>To go back a little bit though, [[Australia]]’s unique [[history]] with [[racism]], to the 
point where it founded itself on a complete lie, is the bedrock which forms all 
racist structures in this country. From [[white]] entitlement, to current 
im[[prison]]ment rates to the continual moral panics which happen when a new group 
of asylum seekers reach these shores (if they are not sent to concentration 
camps first) after we have assisted in [[bomb]]ing the crap out of their countries. 
And let’s not forget the [[battle]]s every single [[Australia]] Day. </p>
<p>I’ve additionally long argued that awful [[government]]-made policy has a long 
[[history]] of being trialled on [[Aboriginal]] people before it is rolled out to other 
populations. Would we, for example, have Manus and Nauru now if we had not had 
Rottnest or Palm Island or pretty much every other [[Aboriginal]] mission ever 
created? What’s worse is that our country has had the hide to partially inspire 
some of the most repugnant laws across the world (for example, apartheid) then 
turn around and criticise those regimes. [[Australia]]ns are awfully good at telling
me that [[America]] is so incredibly racist because of how they treat [[Africa]]n 
[[America]]n people yet neglect to notice that [[Aboriginal]] people are the most 
incarcerated people in the world and a Royal Commission held into [[death]]s in 
custody nearly 30 years ago has essentially gathered dust as none of the 
recommendations have been implemented and people like Ms Dhu are still dying; a 
domestic [[violence]] victim who the police should have been assisting but instead 
end up im[[prison]]ing because she parked her car wrong a few times. </p>
<p>[[Racism]] dialogues from other countries do not translate well here. We are pretty 
unique in the way we’ve approached [[racism]]. When lining up against the [[America]]n 
experience, [[Aboriginal]] people share the dialogues of land theft, disease, 
massacre, colonial rape, rounding up into missions, forced sterilisation, denial
of knowledges and so forth with the [[Native]] [[America]]ns. We share [[slavery]], [[child]] 
theft, exorbitant criminalisation, ghettoisation and so on with [[Africa]]n 
[[America]]ns. This is a simplistic and non-exhaustive list but in short I am trying
to say that the [[Indigenous]] experience here is framed both by global experiences 
of Indigeneity and Blackness and [[Australia]] exists due to our erasure so any 
[[racism]] experienced subsequently by migrant groups, any entitlement felt by [[white]]
people, is down to this. An intersection between blackness and indigeneity – now
there’s a concept. It probably also explains why we can get twice as many people
to a Black Lives Matter in solidarity with the [[America]]n movement than we can to 
a rally on [[Indigenous]] [[incarceration]] two weeks later. Race politics ends up one 
rung above on the ladder if it’s not addressing the original [[racism]] here. </p>
<p>But these are the intersections I never hear about. Almost exclusively, when I 
hear talk about intersectionality, it refers only to feminism. And while 
feminist thought has provided most of the theoretical framework around it, it 
most certainly should not be a consideration which resides only within the 
feminist movement. Because feminism has been at the forefront of these 
discussions on intersectionality; going all the way back to conversations held 
by the Combahee River Collective or even here when arguments were breaking out 
between [[white]] second wave feminists about abortion rights and [[Aboriginal]] 
feminists countering with the fact that they were not even allowed to keep the 
[[child]]ren they had to begin with; it does do it better than most other movements.
Apart from [[Indigenous]] spaces, women’s gatherings were some of the first places I
started to hear acknowledgement of country as a matter of process, for example. 
When I first started my blog, I was pretty convinced that the only people who 
would read it would be other black women. I was surprised therefore that it drew
a broader feminist readership so quickly and black men were reading it as well. 
Discovering one day that it actually also managed to have a rather large 
anarchist readership was another surprise, and as I’ve said before it was a 
penny-drop moment for me as to learning where my politics actually sat apart 
from left, [[Aboriginal]] and feminist.</p>
<p>But to return to feminism and intersectionality. Despite the fact that feminism 
has been the major movement to embrace and champion the concept, I honestly 
cannot say that I believe it is doing it particularly well. As alluded to 
earlier, a lot of my experience of intersectionality within feminism has been 
just another form of “othering” and inclusion via assimilation rather than 
subverting the oppressive structures, challenging the systems and shaking stuff 
up. In my more cynical moments, I start wondering if intersectionality is more 
linked to ally status for [[white]] wealthy women than it is the diversification of 
voices and the exploration of compounding structural analysis. And like many who
reside on the broader radical side in most of my politics, I am pretty concerned
by the no-platforming and silencing which seems to be inherent in shallow 
allegedly intersectional practice.</p>
<p>I want to take a recent example from my own writing as an intersectional 
starting point. It became known through various reports that a number of 
[[Aboriginal]] girls in remote areas were [[missing]] school while they were 
menstruating. The part which stuck out to most of the readers of this article 
was the fact that menstrual products in these communities can cost up to $10 
which, when you’re from a severely impoverished large family, can be the 
equivalent of a couple of canned dinners. </p>
<p>So on seeing this news and reading my opinion piece on it, many sprang into 
action. Lots donated pads and tampons to charities currently working to provide 
these products to [[homeless]] people and branching out into [[Indigenous]] communities.
A few people contacted schools to arrange deliveries. A Country Women’s 
Association branch in [[Queen]]sland; who had been working in collaboration with 
impoverished communities in [[Africa]]; made a stack of reusable fabric pads to send
to these remote communities. People were suggesting crowd-funding menstrual cups
and the like. All of these efforts were wonderful to see.</p>
<p>Yet unfortunately, in their own way, every single one of them missed the point 
by virtue of merely being a bandaid solution. They could recognise the 
intersection between [[Indigenous]], remoteness, [[poverty]] and so forth but the 
answers were merely stop-gap and unlikely to create better situations beyond a 
few months.</p>
<p>The gendered cost on menstrual products making them unaffordable for 
impoverished teenage girls and trans boys who menstruate is an important factor 
of course. Under capitalism, people have found a way to profiteer from many of 
our body’s natural functions and the fact that they tend to profiteer the most 
from creating products to deal with an occurrence that primarily effects women 
is bad enough. The same profit margins don’t appear to be on toilet paper or 
tissues and so forth. That the [[government]] sees fit to also profiteer off this 
occurrence by chucking a tax on top of the profit margin is even worse. That 
these products then have the prices jacked up further by remote delivery and 
limited retail competition in these areas is the icing on the highly expensive 
capitalist cake.</p>
<p>Yet we could solve the problem of cost and provision through [[government]] 
subsidies tomorrow and the rest of it wouldn’t go away. Why are people in these 
communities so severely impoverished in the first place? If we start with land 
theft – there has not been any compensation for these stolen lands and barely 
any agreements on land usage which, considering [[property]] owners of this country 
contribute land tax when they purchase a house is pretty telling. The time to 
pay some rent is well overdue, folks. Then we go on to forced labour and unequal
pay for [[Aboriginal]] workers which in some cases lasted until the mid-[[1980]]s. 
That’s if people were paid at all and of course we still have the fight right 
now for the return of stolen wages which mysteriously disappeared into 
[[government]] trusts never to be seen again. But hey, at least some of my ancestors
got some flour and tea for a hard day's work. </p>
<p>So you take the inherited [[poverty]] and then add programmes such as [[welfare]] 
quarantining due to the NT Intervention, for example. Now an already woefully 
small financial entitlement via our social safety net is untouchable unless it 
is being used to purchase certain items in certain shops which have already 
jacked up their prices. It’s easy to see why a $10 packet of tampons might not 
be as high on the list for purchase as a $10 carton of milk. But then, we also 
have the disgraceful “Community Development Programme” or the special blackfella
work for the dole. Suddenly, the people who are supposed to be undertaking 25hrs
per week of unpaid labour with no workplace protections such as workcover, sick 
leave and so on for everything from local councils to private enterprises are 
being cut off from their [[welfare]] payments at a rate around 80% higher than 
everyone else for alleged infringements which could be as simple as “arrived 
late”. I mean, can we really trust private enterprises profiteering off free 
labour to not be abusive? So when half the community is cut off from payments 
and is suffering from hunger or malnutrition, and the other half is having to 
prop up their extended family, exactly who is going to be able to cobble some 
change together to buy some pads?</p>
<p>Then we come to the question of facilities. It was noted in the reports that 
some of the schools these [[kids]] are not going to while menstruating don’t even 
have functioning toilet facilities with doors that lock for privacy 
considerations. This is despite building works promised by the [[government]] under 
the NT Intervention. Additionally, it is not uncommon for communities to be 
without running water at all, and this is something I myself wrote about a 
couple of years ago where an entire community was without running water for four
months. Access to washing machines or facilities to rinse menstrual cups or soak
reusable pads is also not a given considering that we are, in a lot of 
circumstances, talking about communities running on groundwater and mineral 
deposits regularly render taps unusable. What’s more, the communities are not 
allowed to just go down to Bunnings and fix the problems because their entire 
lives are being sanctioned and so they can wait for several months for a tap to 
be fixed and the cost of this ends up being in the hundreds for a simple repair.</p>
<p>I haven’t even gotten to cultural issues yet. There are taboos around 
menstruation and partly this is inherited from [[white]] missionaries and their 
teachings of the uncleanliness of such activities. Partly it’s ancient taboos 
around gendered business. One of the most condescending things I think I saw 
when I wrote this article was a claim that [[white]] people don’t have social issues
around menstruation. My response was pretty much “well why do you call menstrual
items ‘feminine hygiene’ or ‘sanitary protection’ then?” Other taboos exist in 
some [[Indigenous]] communities on top of this and while education and community 
support may assist in some circumstances, not much can be done without having 
the facilities and means to be able to work in more positive ways in the first 
place.</p>
<p>So there you have it. It started with tampons, went to capitalism then [[racism]] 
and gender politics and all of this is geared around the denial of autonomy and 
self-determination. A shipment of pads is not going to assist this. A smashing 
of systems of oppression to ensure that [[Aboriginal]] girls (and trans boys who 
menstruate) are not penalised for their gender and sex, their location, their 
race and just in general is where we are left at the end of the day. Analysing 
all of these elements at the same time to see how these girls have less access 
than impoverished people in the cities who have less access than mainly women 
but also transmen and non-binary people in cities who are additionally wealthy 
but who are financially penalised compared to wealthy [[white]] blokes and ensuring 
that [[liberation]] occurs at that critical end first is precisely what 
intersectionality should be.</p>
<p>This is all a roundabout way for me to get down to why I think intersectionality
ends up being shallow. This is controversial but for me, intersectionality has 
utterly nothing to do with being a good ally. When a woman of colour from a 
community which practices FGM is trying to talk about the cultural imperatives 
behind this and is ends up being silenced because someone decides to talk about 
the fundraiser they’re running to raise money for women in some region nearby, 
this is not being intersectional. Including a couple of black women on a panel 
then referring to them only for “special comments” while assuming that they 
couldn’t possibly have anything else to say, such as what happened to myself and
Roxane Gay on a panel a couple of years ago at what is supposed to be one of the
premiere feminist festivals, is not being remotely intersectional. 
No-platforming is not being intersectional either. Pro[[testing]] is great and 
should be actively encouraged. But when you’re an ally and you’re trying to 
convince a person from a marginalised background that someone else should not be
listened to or have a voice when that marginalised person has had to fight tooth
and nail to gain any traction in the first place, it’s rarely going to work. The
answer is to instead promote the voices of the oppressed.</p>
<p>I’ve read some hardcore stuff in my time written by radical feminists. Some of 
it has been actively racist, other has been transphobic. Likewise, I have read 
hard leftist theory that has been orientalist, or downright sexist. I’ve read 
radical [[Indigenous]] rights theory which has been separatist, has been sexist and 
has been devoid of class analysis. Yet despite all of this, what I learnt from 
every single one of these was the art of structural analysis and that is not 
something I have ever been able to gain from liberal analysis which to me reads 
like choice politics and the art of assimilation.</p>
<p>Yet as I said, intersectionality often seems to be the sole preserve of the 
feminist movement and this shouldn’t be the case. My “other life” as people know
is the National [[Aboriginal]] and Torres Strait Islander Organiser of the National 
Tertiary Education Union. I additionally serve on the Women’s Action Committee 
of the NT[[EU]] as it was pretty much a hard ask to keep me off it, if I’m honest. 
And I feel exceptionally privileged to work for this union because it is one of 
the few which has driven a strong [[Indigenous]] [[sovereignty]] agenda. It has also 
been at the frontline of many women’s rights at work struggles and was one of 
the first to introduce domestic [[violence]] leave as part of enterprise bargaining.
It also has a commitment to academic freedom and is not affiliated with the ALP 
and that independence and respect for discussion has created an environment 
which has seen my external voice supported in ways it wouldn’t be elsewhere. </p>
<p>I do love a good solidarity [[protest]] and it’s a rare occasion that I don’t make 
it out to actions being taken by other unions. Yet at times, I realise when in 
this environment just how much cotton wool I am wrapped in. There’s nothing 
quite like hearing a male official from another union blame domestic [[violence]] on
the capitalists because they’ve cut their workers’ wages which leads to stressed
and angry blokes. There’s nothing quite like hearing another official claim that
they are going to “fuck the bosses up the arse” while addressing a picket line. </p>
<p>I also cannot tell you, as a unionist and Arrernte [[sovereignty]] activist, just 
how much a campaign about saving “Aussie jobs” or keeping “Aussie jobs for 
Aussie workers” does not appeal to me, particularly off the back of unsavoury 
union support for the White [[Australia]] Policy and their blind eye to exploitation
of [[Indigenous]] labour for so long. Perhaps I’m also too internationalist to be 
able to deal with hearing workers on a couple of dollars a day being talked 
about as if they are competition rather than heavily exploited comrades. Oh, and
if I hear about “the lads on the line” or about “Smitho’s missus who was crucial
to our campaign” but who apparently does not even have a first name, I think I 
will scream. Male-dominated unions are still seen as the real workers which we 
are all supposed to support yet getting them to actually mark International 
Working Women’s Day on the 8^th of [[March]] by walking in solidarity is continually
like pulling teeth.</p>
<p>Yes, the union movement could be a hell of a lot more intersectional in its 
approach. As could the left, including the radical left. There will be no 
workers’ [[revolution]] in a society where women are still secondary and are 
expected to pick up all the caring responsibilities. We will not be overthrowing
any class system if we are willing to turn a blind eye to the exploitation of 
non-[[white]] labour, both here and internationally – often for our own capitalist 
benefit and sense of entitlement. There is nothing inherently [[revolution]]ary in 
covering up rape culture, or treating women like crap, or [[foster]]ing racist 
environments. It’s just the destruction of the class system and the 
collectivisation of self-managed labour for the privileged few.</p>
<p>Finally, and I have left this one until last because it is the most difficult to
talk about in a country which was built on the racist bedrock mentioned earlier,
but [[Aboriginal]] rights needs to get more intersectional as well. It’s a difficult
discussion to have additionally because in this country we are continually 
having to defend our culture because it has been under attack since [[1770]]. It’s a
friggin tough spot to be in. </p>
<p>In fact, naturally we are forced to do intersectionality to an extent anyway due
to being a severe minority so I do find some aspects of diversity which are more
readily embraced in an [[Indigenous]] context than other fights, but we still have 
some ways to go. I think, for example, we tend to account for disability better 
than other rights fights, but when elders are the senior people in your movement
and when you have significantly higher rates of disability and [[health]] issues 
than other communities, necessity drives this more than [[revolution]]ary politics. 
I think we have also been more accepting of sexuality and gender diversity to an
extent, though when I am having to refute statements made by conservative 
Christian [[Aboriginal]] groups against Marriage Equality, I have to wonder if I am 
correct on this matter. </p>
<p>Then there is the celebration of the creation of the "[[Aboriginal]] middle class" 
by some of our moderate and conservative commentators - as if this is something 
to be proud of and not just assimilation while leaving our most vulnerable 
behind.</p>
<p>Gender politics comes up often though, and it’s a [[battle]] I see playing out in so
many ways. From traditional ideas of gender equivalence meaning gender equality 
or arguments of matriarchal societies; which exist in some cases but in others 
what is meant is that there were strong women in patriarchal societies along 
with matrilineal inheritance structures. As we keep trying to tell [[white]] people,
we are not a homogeneous cultural group and differences exist from one end of 
the land mass to the other. Then we have contemporary sexisms. I mean, according
to the theories of intersectionality, an [[Aboriginal]] man has at least one less 
structure of oppression holding him down than an [[Aboriginal]] woman. While we are 
seeing this play out constantly in [[white]] society where the “[[Aboriginal]] voice” 
has been dominated by conservative black men because they are the least 
threatening to the status quo, we also see it play out in our communities.</p>
<p>I will never, for example, forget seeing that statement put out by the [[War]]riors 
of the [[Aboriginal]] Resistance last year, I believe. In it, they pointed out to 
the many people who had been contacting them to stop referring to them as “brus”
or asking if you “brothers needed any assistance” because they were a collective
of mainly young [[Aboriginal]] women. These young women had been shutting down 
Melbourne for months, they had put their bodies on the line, they had dealt with
the police yet somehow, despite them being so visible, a disconnect happened 
with many community members where it was assumed that such [[revolution]]ary actors 
had to be men.</p>
<p>Worse still was recently when Sam Thaiday made a concurrently racist and sexist 
comment on the Footy Show where he was asked about his preference for women and 
he claimed that he liked “[[jungle]] fever” when he was younger but “[[white]] was 
right” now. I have utterly no interest in the sportsball whatsoever which is my 
key failing as an [[Aboriginal]] person, apart from my vegetarianism and my loathing
of country music, of course. But naturally, there was a strong community 
reaction to this with many expressing their disgust with Thaiday’s comments and 
making statements in support of [[Aboriginal]] women.</p>
<p>This community reaction was wonderful to see except for one small detail: so 
many of these comments ended up replacing Thaiday’s sexist comments with more 
socially-acceptable sexist comments. As a single [[Aboriginal]] woman who is not a 
mother, I don’t want to hear about how I am the life-giver of our community. I 
don’t want to hear how I’m behind some man giving him strength. I am not a 
nurturer and as someone with a fucked back, I’m also no one’s backbone. Yet 
continually, we saw these comments and we’re supposed to be thankful for 
continually being cast as the support act in the community, even though we’re 
leading [[[[protest]]s]], we’re challenging systems, we’re contributing thought and we 
are basically doing a lot more things than what we are given credit for. And 
we’re doing so while experiencing [[violence]] at rates 38 times higher than any 
other women. While we’re dying and the alleged justice system cannot even be 
bothered charging our [[kill]]ers. </p>
<p>So after all that, I guess I had better get to some closing points. I believe 
that the politics of intersectionality is inherently [[revolution]]ary and indeed, I
feel that within movements such as anarchism, where autonomy and collaboration 
based upon mutual aid and respect are core values create a natural fit for 
intersectional politics. I certainly believe this is why I see so many 
[[revolution]]ary [[Aboriginal]] people self-identifying their political leanings as 
anarchism and it’s why I feel that I myself seemed to just fall into that barrel
without meaning to. Though let’s be honest, there’s little chance of an 
[[Aboriginal]] person trusting the system anyway…</p>
<p>But when it comes to intersectionality, we have to be incredibly careful because
without that strong structural analysis, without that commitment to the rights 
of other human beings and the notion of equality for all, without using 
privilege to elevate the voices of those who have less rather than talking over 
them in the name of being an ally, it runs the risk of being identity politics 
doomed for nothing more than circular games of oppression Olympics. Our actions 
be driven towards the identification of the systems of oppression and the 
clearing of the obstacles to allow diversification of discussion. We’re doing 
nothing if we talk [[revolution]] but continually promote [[white]] men and their 
tactics as leaders. We’re just reinforcing the new status quo. Thank you. </p>
