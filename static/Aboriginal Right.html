<p>[[Aboriginal]] Right:
A Conciliatory Concept</p>
<p>BRUCE MORITO</p>
<p>abstract The confusion that persists over [[Aboriginal]] claim in [[North]] [[America]] calls</p>
<p>examination. The paper begins by sorting out various versions of'[[Aboriginal]] right' and som</p>
<p>main factors that govern its use. Confusion is analysed as the result of conflating different</p>
<p>reference which determine different sets of expectations by [[Aboriginal]] and [[government]]
tatives.
To appreciate the significance of this conflation, it is helpful if not necessary to view the move to use</p>
<p>the concept '[[Aboriginal]] right' as a strategic rather than a legally substantive one. Understanding
the move in this way helps to explain why it is that definitions remain elusive. The effect of using the</p>
<p>concept has indeed been to enable [[Aboriginal]]s finally and effectively to table their claim. However,</p>
<p>the strategy has its cost. Using the language of the courts places [[Aboriginal]] negotiators at a
disadvantage, since that language is ineluctably tied to [[Europe]]an social and legal sensibilities that
militate against understanding [[Aboriginal]] claim.</p>
<p>If, in the end, we understand that the move to use the language of the courts has been
conciliatory, we can better recognise the nature of [[Aboriginal]] claim. We can begin to understand
that it involves a complex web of responsibilities and commitments, most of which have either been
forgotten or perverted to suit [[government]] agendas. We can begin to see that it has to do with restoring</p>
<p>a relationship of mutual respect and protection.</p>
<p>The attempt to resolve conflicts and overcome the impasses encountered in negotiations
between [[North]] [[America]]n [[Aboriginal]] peoples and [[government]]s has acquired a peculiarity;
the negotiation process seems simultaneously to suit and to misrepresent the nature of the
conflict. Initial observations suggest that [[government]] and [[Aboriginal]] [[representative]]s alike
are engaged in bargaining ploys. Both seem to be posturing and entrenching positions in the
anticipation of negotiated compromise. Using the language of the courts has had much to do
with generating the assumption that [[Aboriginal]] claim can and is to be recognized according
to a negotiation conflict-resolution process. The right to self-determination, the right to
self-[[government]], the right to restoration of a land base all suggest that negotiations are being</p>
<p>played out on the same field as are labour-management disputes. Each side seems to want a
fair share of a commonly valued item, such as land, profit, security conditions.</p>
<p>But not all [[Aboriginal]] peoples want their rights recognised in the same way as those who
are demanding a place on the negotiation platform (e.g., many elders and hereditary or
traditional chiefs). Throughout [[North]] [[America]], native populations are split between
supporters of more traditional ways and those who are prepared to negotiate legal, political,</p>
<p>and economic divisions of power. The band council system of [[government]], for example,</p>
<p>while recognized by the [[Canadian]] [[government]] [1], is rejected in some [[Aboriginal]]</p>

<p>communities. Consequently, it is difficult, not only to know which body repres</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] claim, but to know to what that claim and its corresponding right am</p>
<p>I will attempt to sort out and analyse the use of rights language in [[Aboriginal]]</p>
<p>order to clarify the significance of its use. Once sorted out, the variety of uses of '</p>
<p>right' can be analysed as having a common basis in the experience of injustice. My</p>
<p>focus will be on the moral significance, rather than meaning or definition of the te</p>
<p>as will soon become evident, the meaning of [[Aboriginal]] right is unclear and cont</p>
<p>hope, therefore to suggest a possible re-formulation of [[Aboriginal]] claim through th</p>
<p>emphasis. I am not reformulating [[Aboriginal]] claim in order to get it right, so to</p>
<p>simply to shed new light on the issue, in the interest of overcoming som
misunderstanding and seemingly deliberate misconceptions of the claim.</p>
<p>Accordingly, coming to use rights language by [[Aboriginal]]s can be understood as</p>
<p>conciliatory move. Caution, however, must be exercised here. I am not say
[[Aboriginal]] peoples have been prepared to compromise their autonomy, cu</p>
<p>aspirations, that is, the substance of their claim. They have, nevertheless, been c</p>
<p>by virtue of the fact that adopting the language of the courts creates a disadvan
attempting to articulate their claim.</p>
<p>One final cautionary note seems appropriate at this time. So divergent are the
and [[Europe]]an-based political-legal perspectives that some have recommended s
systems of justice [2], I do not, therefore, write with the presumption of havin
insight into the [[Aboriginal]] perspective. My argument, despite utilizing statem</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] persons, rests entirely on the [[Europe]]an moral sensibilities. All</p>
<p>understanding [[Aboriginal]] claim are, therefore, to be qualified as claims to an und</p>
<p>based on what has been (or can be) cross-culturally established as common
reference.</p>
<p>Sorting Out The Use of'[[Aboriginal]] Right' and Its Meanings</p>
<p>The adoption of terms such as 'right' and 'justice' has provided a platform

Conn [3] of the Assembly of First Nations, among others, has noted that the
corresponding concept for 'right' in the Ojibwa language. This lack of a corre</p>
<p>concept seems fairly common among the tribes in [[North]] [[America]] [4]. Consequen</p>
<p>the term 'right' may in fact pervert [[Aboriginal]] claim. If the language does not</p>

This conceptual difficulty warns that the meaning of rights language is likel</p>

<p>being torn.' [7] Ownership and development of the land can itself be seen as un</p>

romantic rhetoric when brought to bear on [[Europe]]an-based legal systems; those who make
the statements have been seen as immature, perhaps even savage simpletons [8]. The frame
of reference required for understanding [[Aboriginal]] claim seems so different from that of the</p>
<p>legal/political status quo that communication of the claim appears impossible.
Historically, [[Canada]] has explicitly announced as much. Prime Minister Pierre [[[[Trudeau]]]]</p>
<p>initially rejected [[Indian]] land claims and demands for redress, because he understood
statements about [[Aboriginal]] title and relations to the land to be fuzzy and devoid of</p>
<p>substance. His recommendation (Aug. 8, [[1969]], [[Vancouver]] B.C.) was to have [[Indian]]s
accept full [[Canadian]] status and to be accorded the rights all [[Canadian]]s enjoy, not special
status or distinctive '[[Aboriginal]]' rights [9]. Admittedly, after Justice Thomas Berger
submitted his report on the [[treatment]] of [[Aboriginal]] peoples [10], [[[[Trudeau]]]] acknowledged
that he had been wrong in asserting that [[Aboriginal]] claims were hopelessly couched in
shadowy language. He concluded that negotiation between [[Aboriginal]]s and the Govern
ment of [[Canada]] must take place: hence, the entrenchment of [[Aboriginal]] rights in the
Constitution Act of [[1982]] [ 11 ]. Since then, [[Canada]] has officially recognized [[Aboriginal]] claim</p>
<p>as distinctive and substantive. [[[[Trudeau]]]]'s shift, however, illustrates a programmatic change
in [[North]] [[America]]n attitudes, whereas the recognition of the distinctive substance of
[[Aboriginal]] claim has yet to be established.</p>
<p>We can also grant that, in some cases, e.g., the [[Navajo]] in the [[United]] [[States]], '[[Aboriginal]]
right' seems clearly formulated. The [[Navajo]] have achieved limited political, economic, and
legal jurisdiction over an area of land. They have their own police force and judicial system.</p>
<p>But not all [[Aboriginal]] claimants are calling for the same manifestation of the right to self
[[government]]. Indeed, not all within the [[Navajo]] system itself agree with the system, since
many on the reservation remain committed to traditional forms of [[government]].</p>
<p>Similarly, in the [[Canadian]] context, deceptively clear formulations have arisen. Elijah
Harper has been quoted as saying that the only thing [[Aboriginal]] peoples want is to be
accorded the same rights and [[treatment]] as any other [[Canadian]] [12]. Herb George of the
Gitskan-Wet'suwet'en tribe has declared that he wants jurisdictional powers similar to those
of the Federal and provincial [[government]]s. Neil Sterrit, negotiator for the Assembly of First
Nations, explains that [[sovereignty]] is the freedom to take responsibility for decisions within
one's own territories. 'Sovereignty' refers to a degree of authority and responsibility within
these territories. Despite the apparent clarity in the claims of these [[representative]]s, their
pronouncements have the ring of political preamble.
From the [[Canadian]] [[North]] through to the [[America]]n West, we find that at the heart of</p>
<p>many if not most [[Aboriginal]] claims lies a different sense of justice than has been
accommodated by the [[Europe]]an-based legal systems. For example, unlike typical land
claims in [[North]] [[America]], where exclusionary ownership and bounded properties define the
land claim, [[Aboriginal]]s often reject such definitions (e.g., the [[Cree]] have quite explicitly
described the incompatibility of claims in this way). Gary Potts (Chief of the Teme Augama</p>
<p>Anishnawbe Aski) has gone as far as to say that the land claim requires that [[Aboriginal]]
peoples teach others how to steward the land. Many among the [[Cree]] and Ojibwa in [[Ontario]]
and [[Quebec]], not to mention the Inuit of the [[North]] and Innu of Labrador, do not want the
[[Navajo]] solution to be treated as the paradigm case for [[Aboriginal]] land claim settlement. The
fact that the implications of a so-called land-claim are so different from what we would</p>
<p>normally expect should lead us to worry about expecting readily formulable definitions of
[[sovereignty]] and land claim.</p>

and [[North]]ern [[New]] York State) as its negotiating team [16]. Some reject the officially</p>
<p>recognised National Assembly of First Nations (headed by Ovide Mercredi) as their
legitimate [[representative]], because it, allegedly, does not represent the [[Native]] peoples as
native peoples. It accepts a reduction of claims and values to those acceptable to [[Europe]]an
sensibilities.</p>
<p>Confusion over [[Aboriginal]] claim and the use of rights, as Dumont suggests, is due to
persisting differences at the level of cosmology and metaphysical commitments [17]. At this</p>
<p>level, commitments are radically different. Dominant [[Europe]]an metaphysical commit
ments deny claims that humans are inseparable from the land. It is not only taken to be a
foreign, but a morally perverted idea. The [[Europe]]an, under the in[[flu]]ences of Locke, among</p>
<p>others (Aquinas, Descartes, Kant), assumes that a radical axiological separation exists
between the human agent and nature [18]. Humanity is in a place of privilege to use and</p>
<p>exploit an otherwise wasted land. Two and a half millennia of entrenching the idea of
superiority from Greek philosophy to Christianity, furthermore, have made the dominant
[[Western]] political body see itself as distinct from nature by virtue of its rationality.
Rationality constitutes a difference in kind and in value (intrinsic versus instru[[mental]]) from</p>
<p>the land. Despite a great deal of work in [[Europe]]an-based philosophy designed to undermine</p>
<p>these commitments, they nevertheless persist, not only in common opinion, but within</p>
<p>professional academic circles as well [19]. The view that oneness with the land (a
metaphysical and moral holism) is to be treated as a primary concept, moreover, has often
been denounced for its support of fascism and totalitarianism [20].</p>
<p>Moreover, [[America]]'s celestially grounded Manifest Destiny to subdue and expand into
the [[North]] [[America]]n continent (if not the world) proceeded to the destruction of the [[North]]
[[America]]n [[Indian]] as both an economic right and a moral duty. This, coupled with the
Christian mission of converting the heathen, demonstrated that it was all but impossible for
the [[America]]n/[[Europe]]an to recognise [[Aboriginal]] culture as a viable frame of reference for the</p>
<p>legal system. Historical inertia, as embodied in legal and political tradition, then, further
entrenches the antagonism toward [[Aboriginal]] metaphysics. [[North]] [[America]]'s heroes are
those who [[conquer]]ed and tamed a wild land, not those who found harmony with it. This
rejection of [[Aboriginal]] claim and perspective demonstrates how wide the gap is between
traditional [[Aboriginal]] leadership and [[government]]. It explains why the use of '[[Aboriginal]]
right' diverges so dramatically from expectation.</p>
<p>Epistemological and methodological commitments also play an important role in
explaining why [[government]] has not moved very much to form a univocal meaning for the
concept. The vision quest [21] which is governed by a spiritual understanding of how the
land and animals communicate with human beings, is either ignored or at best treated as an</p>
<p>idiosyncratic and entertaining peculiarity within our epistemological traditions. More
often, however, such notions of knowledge are treated as laughable. Perhaps the best way to</p>
<p>illustrate our attitudes on such matters is through a dramatic representation.</p>
<p>On a [[Canadian]] Broadcasting Corporation production, [[North]] of Sixty, a modern Dene
community in the [[Canadian]] [[North]] is portrayed as struggling with its [[Aboriginal]] [[history]] and</p>
<p>[[Europe]]an-in[[flu]]enced aspirations. The community is served by both [[white]] and native Royal</p>
<p>[[Canadian]] Mounted Police officers, a [[white]] band manager, and [[white]] shop-keeper. In one
episode, the justice system allows the Dene to exercise their form of justice in dealing with a</p>
<p>member who had committed a criminal offence. That system involved a sentencing circle,
during which the perpetrator was required to sit in a room surrounded by silent members
(elders) of the community. While this session was taking place, there was a transition to a

<p>here, because, while lack of understanding has to do with conceptual difficult
equally to do with emotional reactions.</p>
<p>Our inability to understand [[Aboriginal]] claim involves feelings of offence. A
approaches, as in the vision quest and in the sentencing circle, are by definition</p>
<p>and idiosyncratic [22]. We not only tend to think of these latter modes of know
primitive and undeveloped, we also tend to carry an attitude of disdain toward t</p>
<p>their examination were unworthy of a dignified, self-respecting inquirer. Sim</p>
<p>[[Aboriginal]] justice, as a healing-cum-reconciliation process, not only seems to allo</p>

<p>Walter Berns [23] argues that anger unites people and strengthens the bonds o
that exist between them, when threatened by those who would do them injury.</p>
<p>perhaps fear], when tamed and educated through the forming of laws and pr
grounds systems of justice (especially criminal). Concepts of justice, as they p
security, protection, freedom and self-esteem are supported and perhaps gen</p>

<p>community experiences and shares an anger or passion as a response to injury or</p>
<p>is next to impossible to understand how that community could become knit a
community united under law. Berns demonstrates that our laws, especially th
rounding matters of crime and funda[[mental]] justice (matters having to do with
freedom and dignity) are grounded in primitive passions that underlie our norm</p>
<p>related, metaphysical/epistemological commitments. This is the level at</p>

community.
Considering the in[[flu]]ence of more traditional leadership, the metaphysical underpinnings</p>
<p>of cultural and epistemological resistance, and the confusion over the use of 'right' by
[[Aboriginal]]s can be described as unavoidable. The dispute over definition may then be
irresolvable. Taking historical and cultural contexts into account alone make the meaning of
'right' opaque. If we add the epistemological resistance to the mix, that opacity becomes
more dense. With emotional factors, metaphysical and epistemological resistance becomes
associated with feelings of offence. Assigning a meaning to '[[Aboriginal]] right' is so difficult,
in part, because of volitional factors, our unwillingness to overcome emotional predisposi
tions.

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Right: A Conciliatory Concept 129</p>
<p>The History and Use of Legal Language
What is striking, given the [[Europe]]an dominance over the [[Aboriginal]], is that there has been
any advance in [[Aboriginal]] claims such that we could have arrived at the stage of conflict in</p>
<p>negotiations at all. Indeed, we know in [[Canadian]] [[history]], religious and philosophical
underpinnings of [[Aboriginal]] culture were the targets of eradication. The banning of the
Sundance, potlatch, use of native language, and use of ceremonial (narcotic) substances are
cases in point. We have a long [[history]] of explicitly and implicitly denying the grounding
values of [[Aboriginal]] culture. More than sufficient emotional and institutional momentum,
then, has existed in [[North]] [[America]] to prevent negotiations based on [[Aboriginal]] rights from
being initiated at all. Nevertheless, negotiations have begun and have come a considerable
distance. An important factor in advancing [[Aboriginal]] claim to the level of the courts and in</p>
<p>avoiding complete deadlock has been the fact that [[Aboriginal]]s and the [[government]] are
beginning to use common terms of reference. These terms are those of traditional [[Europe]]an</p>
<p>political and legal systems; movement has been the result of native leaders becoming versed
in the language of the courts.
The language of [[Aboriginal]] right, [[sovereignty]], the inherent right to self-[[government]], and
of land claim, unlike the fuzzy texture of statements which assert a oneness and identity with</p>
<p>the land, are familiar. [[Aboriginal]]s have adopted the role of plaintiff and have put the matter
of justice in terms of redress and failure to honour agreements (contracts or [[treaties]]). Having</p>
<p>been placed in the role of defendant, the [[Canadian]] public and [[government]] now see
themselves as having something to lose. To articulate claims in the language of the courts,
therefore, is to pose a threat to [[property]] rights and political stability. Thus, by using the
language of the courts, [[Aboriginal]] claims have become more effective.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, while [[Aboriginal]]'s use of [[Europe]]an-based moral and legal language has
served to advance their claim, it has also produced the confusion previously described. Since
we know that the term 'right' is foreign to the [[Aboriginal]] when Ovide Mercredi tells us that</p>
<p>' "Inherent right" can mean whatever we want it to mean'[24], we immediately suspect him
of committing some serious error in understanding the concept. Further, in [[Canada]], the
[[Aboriginal]] demand that the inherent right to self-[[government]] be recognised in the
Constitution, without first being defined [25], amply indicates that the concept of right and
its associated concepts, 'justice,' 'fairness,' 'title,' etc. imply different sets of consequences
for [[Aboriginal]]s than for other [[Canadian]]s. Thus, even some of those who appear to have
adopted the [[Europe]]an model of justice and who are criticized by hereditary leaders seem to
conflate and confuse traditional frames of reference with [[Europe]]an ones.
Moreover, Winona Stevenson has told us that 'inherent' in 'inherent right' refers to</p>
<p>something that comes from within as the source of self-[[government]] [26]. For [[Aboriginal]]s,
there seems to be an internal relation between 'right' and 'individual will.' There is no</p>
<p>disconnection between knowing what one must do to govern properly and one's will.</p>
<p>Putting aside the equivocation on the use of 'inherent right' [27], it is obvious that
[[Aboriginal]]s are claiming that a type of relationship between the individual and the
governing power, unfamiliar to our political and legal expectations, needs to be recognised.
We are being asked to recognise the idea that to be governed is to be able to acknowledge
the truth and trustworthiness of a decision. For the [[Aboriginal]], that trustworthiness can be</p>

<p>maker recognised as expressing the will and spirit of each member of the com
chief does not enforce rights so much as serve as the focus through which rig</p>
<p>exercised. According to Dumont, this means that 'self-interest was [is]</p>
<p>intertwined with the tribal interest, that is, the general good and the individu</p>
<p>[are to be] taken to be virtually identical.' [28]. If there is to be constraint</p>
<p>practised in the community, an internal motivation is to be sought as the 'for
the action.</p>
<p>One may be tempted to argue that the apparent advance in negotiations has been nothing
more than an exercise in futility. [[Native]] peoples' use of legal language has been naive and</p>
<p>confused. Like the early [[[[Trudeau]]]], many (e.g., the Reform Party) in [[Canada]] believe that
[[Native]] peoples must accept compensation for the past and realise that reference to historical</p>
<p>tradition is nothing but counter-productive and confused.
However, [[Aboriginal]] negotiators and [[representative]]s are far from legally and politically</p>
<p>naive and are unlikely to be confused. Ovide Mercredi, among others (e.g., Mark
Dockstater, Osgoode Law School, Ph.D candidate; Patricia A. Monture-Okanee, Univer
sity of [[Ottawa]], Faculty of Common Law; Mary Ellen Turpel, Dalhousie University), is
trained in the legal profession. Technical legal expertise has come on the scene in force (e.g.,
Justice Thomas Berger's report, [[North]]ern Frontier, [[North]]ern Homeland; Bruce Clark's book,</p>
<p>[[Native]] Liberty, [[Crown]] Sovereignty [29]. An increasing number of lobby groups working
from within the legal system to support [[Aboriginal]] claim are also under way. Clark's book</p>
<p>has likewise challenged the letter of the law on matters concerning [[treaties]] and the law
concerning [[Aboriginal]] peoples. With all of this legal machinery continually forcing the
message that [[Canada]] (and the [[United]] [[States]]) has acted unjustly, it is implausible to conclude
that [[Aboriginal]] claim is naive and confused.
It is perhaps best to view the present situation as follows: with the legal machinery in
place, an ironic situation has arisen. While the machinery is used to bring the issue of justice</p>
<p>for [[Aboriginal]]s before the legal system, it is at the same time denounced as inadequate to
address [[Aboriginal]] claim. Evidence for this conclusion is Section 35 of the Constitution Act
[[1982]]. It specifically recognises [[Aboriginal]] rights. At the same time, these rights are being
used to argue that the system in which they are recognised is inadequate to define them.
Coming to use legal language, does not appear to be the result of confusion, but of a strategic
move to use the legal system to overcome barriers to communication. The use of legal
language is, for the most part, not substantive, in the sense that it indicates acceptance of
terms on which negotiation is to proceed. A closer look at the historical context of [[Aboriginal]]
claim further supports this 'strategy' interpretation.
The [[history]] of injustice involves the destruction of traditional forms of [[government]], the
relocating of entire communities and the banning of traditional religious practices essential</p>
<p>to the culture by [[Canadian]] and [[America]]n authorities. [[Aboriginal]] claim is connected to the
loss of a way of life, an environment (more precisely, a sense of place) and an identity as
individuals and as communities. Lloyd Barber (former federal land claims negotiator) has
sugested that justice requires empowering natives to live in a manner similar to the time
before [[Europe]]ans came to [[North]] [[America]] [30]. Clearly, Barber recognises that the loss has
been a way of life. Berger's report to the [[Canadian]] [[government]] is filled with warnings that
[[Canada]] must be aware of the fact that development of the [[North]] will mean the destruction
not only of tangible items such as wildlife and clean water, but of intangible items such as a
way of life and cultural values that are tied to the land. He goes as far as to cite Chief Justice</p>
<p>John Marshall of U.S. Supreme court ([[1823]]) to make his point: [[Europe]]an arrogance and

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Right: A Conciliatory Concept 131</p>
<p>imposition of 'civilisation' and 'religion' have been a major force in disenfranchising
[[Aboriginal]] peoples from just dealings [31]. Hence, an explicit recognition of unjust
[[treatment]] defined as disenfranchisement from a way of life has existed within official circles
for many years.</p>
<p>Particularly helpful in the recognition of the order of injustice is a statement by Marlene
Castelano of Trent University: 'it [the inherent right to self-[[government]]] is the re-creating of</p>
<p>trust relationships that we once had.' This trust, as the Royal Proclamation of [[1763]] [32]
implies, is between nations, sovereign nations, whose autonomy is to be respected and
protected under law. [[King]] George Ill's Proclamation was intended to protect [[Aboriginal]]
peoples from undue exploitation by ensuring that fair settlements over land claims and
ceding of land west of the Appalachians (all land west of the [[Atlantic]] watershed) could be
done only through [[representative]]s of the [[Crown]]. History is all too clear on the fact that few</p>
<p>[[Europe]]an settlements since the Proclamation were actually established through legitimate
channels. What has been lost through unjust [[treatment]], then, is a matter of both cultural
and inter-cultural integrity. Castelano's statement is critical, because it expresses a truth</p>
<p>that has been largely ignored in debates over [[Aboriginal]] rights. For the most part,
negotiations have to do with rights to territories, self-[[government]], resource rights and the</p>
<p>like. These rights tend to separate and isolate [[Aboriginal]] and [[Europe]]an communities in such</p>
<p>a way as to cause negotiations to take the form of dividing jurisdictions, powers, and
resources. But buried within these disputes is the more funda[[mental]] issue of inter-cultural
well-being and the lack of respect that has been paid to agreements that have been designed
to protect the integrity of the web of cultures.</p>
<p>While Barber's formulation is programmatically helpful in aiding us to see how
comprehensive in scope the injustice to [[Aboriginal]] peoples has been, Castelano's
formulation is more substantive, since it targets the relationship between [[Aboriginal]] and
[[Europe]]an civilizations. At the time of the Proclamation, this relationship was clearly
formulated as one between sovereign nations. The sense of injustice and what has been lost,
consequently, can be articulated in terms of the relation between the two parties, and does</p>
<p>not rely entirely on our having to understand the [[Aboriginal]] perspective. The order of
injustice has to do with fiduciary relationships that mutually protected the well-being of
diverse societies, relationships built on honour and law. Historically, [[Aboriginal]] claim has
had principally to do with [[sovereignty]] and autonomy (self-determination) within the
relationship between [[Aboriginal]] and [[Europe]]an nations.
To what did this relationship amount? If we note that the meaning of '[[treaty]]' has to do
with agreements in order to maintain peace, a peace which both sides are to enjoy, at the very</p>
<p>least, the relationship between [[Aboriginal]] and [[government]] involved a degree of mutual
respect. At the time of the Proclamation of [[1763]], both parties agreed to peaceful co
existence and the rule of law. Without the agreement neither side could have had its way of
life guaranteed, since a perpetual threat of war would have prevailed. According to Berger
[33], the Proclamation was formed after the seven year war with the [[French]] to ensure that
the Iroquois would not side with the [[French]]. Both the [[British]] and the [[French]] vied for
[[alliance]]s with the Iroquois, Micmacs and the [[Huron]] as they waged [[battle]] with each other.
Even if only for reasons of expediency, the relationship between [[Aboriginal]] groups and
[[Europe]]ans has been understood to be one of mutual respect for sovereign peoples. Treaties,
like the Proclamation, in principle, respect the conditions of honour and dignity of the
signatories. They are not mere contracts, moreover, but agreements based on the mutual
recognition of the power each signatory possesses.

<p>Since from the time of [[[[Trudeau]]]]'s pronouncement [[government]]s have not denied
that [[treaties]] and agreements have been broken, there is no issue to be sorted out</p>
<p>now is to determine the significance of having been the victims of broken agreem</p>
<p>significance cannot be determined solely by the law, for in fact the legitimacy of som</p>
<p>[[treaties]] and laws has been rejected (evidence to follow in the next section). What</p>
<p>focus on, if we are to take [[Aboriginal]] rights as distinctive, is what it signifies for A</p>
<p>to have been denied autonomy, the sort of self-rule compatible with a web of
Having virtually dismissed [[sovereignty]] agreements, our [[government]]s have allo
destruction of a people, their corresponding sense of freedom and self-esteem. If
less on what has happened to [[Aboriginal]] peoples and more on what we have done
readily intelligible context for understanding the implications for just dealing
established.</p>
<p>Even if we claim not to understand the grounding values and passions of the [[Aboriginal]]
peoples, we cannot fail to understand what disenfranchising a signatory, a community, and
a nation means for us as moral agents. These are acts of commission, not merely omission.</p>
<p>We cannot explain away our actions as oversights or the results of unavoidable confusion
over the meaning of [[Aboriginal]] claim. Once we adopt this point of view as perpetrators of</p>
<p>injustice, we can clearly understand the nature of the injustice under question. It includes
arbitrarily, deliberately and maliciously excluding [[Aboriginal]] peoples from the moral
community to which they originally belonged.</p>
<p>It is impossible to claim that the perpetrators of injustice did not know that they were
excluding [[Aboriginal]] peoples from the moral community. More empirical evidence for this
claim will be examined in the following section. For the moment, it is sufficient to note that
the significance of '[[Aboriginal]] right' is determined by their disenfranchisement. In the final
analysis, it is used to repudiate the system of justice that has engineered their exclusion from</p>
<p>the moral community. This right is not something yet to be established, but to be
recognised. Thus, definitional difficulties are to some extent irrelevant, when deter[[mining]]
significance. '[[Aboriginal]] right' operates more to announce a claim rather than form the
substance of that claim. Such being the case, the move to use rights language is best seen as a</p>
<p>strategic move to communicate in an effective manner. I submit that the underlying
motivation for the move is the recognition that [[government]]s have indeed had the capacity to</p>
<p>understand their claim, but have chosen not to understand.</p>
<p>Rights as Conciliatory
I turn now to the question, 'What kind of move is the move to use "[[Aboriginal]]" right?' If the</p>
<p>move is conciliatory, it must be shown that [[Aboriginal]] peoples lose something by adopting
the language. What they lose is the likelihood of negotiating on a level playing field and of
having their claims adequately represented. The [[history]] of injustice can once again serve as a
springboard. I begin with a sketch of some of the main conditions of cultural autonomy that
have been denied [[Aboriginal]] peoples, in order to provide the background against which the
move can be understood.</p>
<p>The land is the place in which an identity is born and nurtured. To have a spiritual
connection to the land is at minimum to have an identity relation with the land, where

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Right: A Conciliatory Concept 133
identity is formulated in holistic terms. That is, identity implies that the [[Aboriginal]] person
takes him or herself to be an aspect of the land such that what the person is depends on what</p>
<p>the land is. In this way, [[Aboriginal]] persons would be incapable of adopting a system of
[[government]] and law that separates their identity as individuals from that of the land as a
living being.
Chief Seattle (or Sealth of the Duwamish tribe) is said to have expressed incredulity over
the idea that the land could be owned; exploiting the land, to him, would be like exploiting
ourselves (plural intended). Whether Sealth actually made this statement is not critical here.
The statement serves to capture what many other [[Aboriginal]] peoples have said about their
relation to the land and what their stories and myths are meant to teach [34]. What we are to</p>
<p>note when encountering the [[Aboriginal]] wisdom, myths, stories, and religion, is this: to be
an Ojibwa, a [[Cree]], or Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) is to be an integral part of a particular land,
a relationship which is formed by an intricate web of mutually dependent members. It is to</p>
<p>understand community in a wide and pluralistic sense. It is to understand that one's dignity
is tied to the generosity, courage, and respect with which one treats and interacts with other</p>
<p>members of the community [35]. The loss of a land base is different for [[Aboriginal]]s than
for [[Europe]]ans. Nevertheless, it is tied to their sense of autonomy (self-determination). In
being denied the right to the land on which they and their ancestors lived and thrived, the
right to exercise their values and to fulfil their aspirations as persons and communities have
also been denied.</p>
<p>In relation to this denial, George Erasmus has said, 'What we want is self-reliance, self
control, internal growth (autonomy). We want to start a process of healing.' [36] Despite</p>
<p>seeming an odd way to formulate a claim, Erasmus makes it clear that part of being
disenfranchised has been to have the conditions necessary for personhood and community
identity (basic constituents of the autonomous being) denied or eradicated. Depriving
[[Aboriginal]]s of a land base by moving them to reservations destroys the integrated network
of relationships that form the basis of autonomy. The form of deprivation taken, therefore,
was an injustice of the most funda[[mental]] order conceivable.
It is not beyond the capacity of the political and legal system to recognise these conditions</p>
<p>of autonomy, as [[[[Trudeau]]]] once thought. Notions of oneness with the land and healing,
granted, may be fuzzy and foreign. But the frame of reference to which they belong is not all</p>
<p>that fuzzy and foreign. The idea of justice as righting balances and restoring harmony in a
community is to be found in Plato. His theory of justice in Book IV of the Republic [37] takes</p>
<p>justice to be what makes the three essential qualities of a city (moderation, courage and
wisdom) first appear and then to remain in the city. Justice, here, is an ordering principle,
harmonising the three virtues as the city becomes vibrant and strong, characteristics closely
aligned with [[health]]. Moreover, as it is not itself clearly formulable, justice is something that
brings about the other virtues and the consequent harmony in the city, much like justice as a
process does in [[Aboriginal]] tradition.</p>
<p>This remark on Plato is meant to demonstrate that there has been little reason to be so
dismissive even of the more opaque elements of [[Aboriginal]] perspective. My earlier remark</p>
<p>on our having willed not to understand, as much as we have found that we cannot
understand the [[Aboriginal]] perspective, can now be modified. Our lack of will has been a
larger factor than our lack of cognitive devices in failing to recognise [[Aboriginal]] perspective.</p>
<p>Promising routes to the disclosure of the conditions of [[Aboriginal]] autonomy have wilfully
remained unexamined both politically and legally. Destruction of persons and communities
cannot, therefore, be explained as an unforeseeable consequence of denying a land base.

<p>Although not unforeseeable, it might be argued that it is beyond the responsi
governing powers to understand the implications of their actions, when those im</p>
<p>are determined by a foreign frame of reference. However, when addressing the c</p>
<p>members of the moral community, such argument is inadmissible. In a landmar</p>
<p>by the Supreme Court of [[Canada]], [[1988]], Justice Bertha Wilson explained why th
law established in [[1969]] had to be abolished. She cites Neil MacCormick [38]: on
respect as a human being and the contentment that resides in the ability to pursue</p>
<p>conception of a full and rewarding life is foundational in a free and democratic s</p>
<p>ability to make autonomous decisions is vital to this pursuit. Thus, Wilson argues</p>
<p>to re-instate respect for the dignity and self-esteem of women, the paternalistic abo</p>
<p>which take the decision making power away from individual women must be
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The [[treatment]] of [[Aboriginal]] peoples has violated the same funda[[mental]] values. The
phrase, 'one's conception of a full and rewarding life,' implies that the courts can and do</p>
<p>recognise that embracing a plurality of terms of reference when deter[[mining]] what
constitutes dignity and self-esteem is critical in a truly democratic society. The Wilson
decision called those who were alien to the experience of womanhood to recognise the
principle that, notwithstanding the inability to appreciate a woman's experience and
situation, the male members of society are to accept women's conditions of autonomy,
dignity and self-esteem. It is incumbent on those in positions of power in a liberal society to</p>
<p>recognise distinctive situations, despite the fact that such recognition conflicts with basic
moral sensibilities, such as those pertaining to the status of the fetus. The Supreme Court</p>
<p>decision implies that, when the claimant's injury involves matters of dignity and self
esteem, his or her injury must be addressed in accordance with those terms of reference,
even though the decision-makers may lack an understanding of the terms. When we can
demonstrate that dignity and self-esteem have been lost or denied as the result of some
system or practice of the dominant society, it is incumbent on that society to recognise the
need to change its systems and practices in order to establish suitable conditions.</p>
<p>If there has, in principle, been room in the liberal [[Europe]]an tradition for acknowledging
some elements of [[Aboriginal]] perspective and culture, and more poignantly, for making</p>
<p>pursuit of understanding the conditions of [[Aboriginal]] autonomy a responsibility, then
[[Aboriginal]] peoples would be justified in expecting the political and legal systems to have
protected those conditions of autonomy. They would be justified in standing firm on the
claim that it is incumbent on the [[government]] to acknowledge the [[Aboriginal]] terms of
reference. If so, then the [[government]] would also be responsible for facilitating the
development of a mutually satisfying framework of justice before negotiation could
proceed.</p>
<p>Indeed, at points early in the developing relationship between the [[Europe]]an and
[[Aboriginal]] nations, a mutually recognised sense of justice governed the relationship.
Despite their differing elements, the two approaches to justice shared funda[[mental]] values
and principles, as reflected in the Proclamation. What the following describes, therefore, is
a belligerent denial of this common ground and a once recognised responsibility. (It also
serves as evidence for the view that disenfranchisement was the product of deliberate acts of</p>
<p>exclusion.)
As an elder of the Nishnawbe-Aski [39] has described, many [[treaties]] were enacted by a
mere show of hands or 'X's' on pieces of paper. But, those [[treaties]] meant funda[[mental]]ly
different things to the [[Crown]] and to the [[Cree]]/Ojibwa of Hudson [[Bay]], for example. The

[[representative]]s of the [[Crown]] are said to have announced that the [[Queen]] wanted all of them
(the [[Cree]] and the Ojibwa) to be her [[child]]ren. She did not want their islands, their fish and</p>
<p>water; she wanted only ten inches of top soil. For the [[Cree]] and Ojibwa, whose tradition
found ownership a foreign idea, it could not be foreseen that the [[Queen]] meant that they
would be ceding the land to her. Indeed, if Dumont's account of the [[Aboriginal]] world view
is correct, sharing [40] is an essential value whose manifestations in attitudes and principles</p>
<p>of social conduct excludes any notion of [[property]]. Hence, [[treaty]] 'signing' was advan
tageous to the [[government]] in the sense that the playing field on which negotiations were to</p>
<p>be played out was that which the [[government]] had designed. Imposing [[Europe]]an-based legal</p>
<p>procedure onto negotiations and [[treaty]] signings was itself a denial of the common ground
that existed between the nations. Such imposition was an act of substituting the legal process</p>
<p>recognised by only one party for a process that should have been mutually constructed.</p>
<p>[[Treaty]] signing was, as a result, in many instances, a misrepresentation of [[Aboriginal]]
claim, because [[Aboriginal]] signatories would not have agreed to sign had they understood the</p>
<p>consequences of signing. From the point of view of the [[government]] such [[treaties]] were in</p>
<p>effect expressions of a dismissive attitude toward [[Aboriginal]] procedures for reaching</p>
<p>agreement, since little concern for representing their perspective was shown. Legal
procedure was devised as a means for gaining an advantage over the [[Aboriginal]], not for
achieving just relations.
Outright contempt for [[Aboriginal]] peoples has been demonstrated throughout the [[history]]
of [[Europe]]an occupation of [[North]] [[America]]. The intention of the [[Canadian]] [[government]] has</p>
<p>been to use whatever means was necessary to acquire lands from [[Aboriginal]] peoples. The
following instructions to the Lieutenant-governor of [[North]]west T erritories after the cession
of Rupert's land are particularly noteworthy: "Turn attention promptly toward [[North]] and</p>
<p>West assuring [[Indian]]s of your desire to establish friendly relations with them, you will
ascertain and report to His Excellency the course you may think most advisable to pursue,
whether by [[treaty]] or otherwise, for the removal of any obstructions that might be presented</p>
<p>to the flow of population into the fertile lands that lie between [[Manitoba]] and the Rocky
Mountains" [41]. Two observations can be made. First, a common ground in a sense of
justice must have prevailed at the time for the [[government]] to have anticipated using legal
devices to gain possession of the Prairies. Second, the legal machinery was not employed to
develop just relations but to exploit the common ground.</p>
<p>Similar contempt and condescension is illustrated in the [[Indian]] Act, which allows the</p>
<p>[[government]] to assume all responsibility for handling [[Indian]] moneys and deprives
[[Aboriginal]] communities of the responsibility for decision-making. Taking decision-making
responsibility away from [[Aboriginal]] peoples is tantamount to depriving the [[Aboriginal]]
person of the context in which self-esteem and dignity gain support. Both policy and
legislation demonstrate a contempt that led to the exclusion of [[Aboriginal]] peoples from the</p>
<p>protection and responsibilities of the moral community. What were virtual genocide
programmes followed. Taking native [[child]]ren from their parents and community to educate
them in the ways of a Christian world was in effect an officially sanctioned way of eliminating</p>
<p>a culture, a people. Dislocation and forced 'Catholic' residential schooling were the
[[government]]'s ways of responding to its fear that native [[child]]ren, if allowed to return to their</p>
<p>communities, would slip back into savagery.</p>
<p>More devious routes were taken to exercise complete disregard: these took the form of</p>
<p>assimilation programmes. Assimilation programmes would appear initially to be a step
toward accepting [[Aboriginal]]s as members of the community. This, however, turned out not

<p>to be the case. A prime example is the assimilation programme of Alberta. It
that the [[Indian]] would have to become civilized and not be allowed to continue</p>
<p>hunting and nomadic life. He would have to be trained as a farmer. In Alber
many natives proved to be extremely good farmers. Settlers lobbied, as a res

([[1888]]) Deputy Minister of [[Indian]] Affairs Haiter Reid, proclaimed that the
have to evolve from hunter to peasant and only then to modern man. He would</p>

<p>to [[kill]] their own livestock, or to sell their products of labour [42], Disaster
ensued. Rather than perceiving this outcome as a tragedy, it was seen as pr
[[Indian]]s would never learn. A later rendition of this contempt is cited by Ge
[43]. In a House of Commons speech by Deputy Superintendent of [[Indian]] Aff</p>
<p>Campbell Scott, the House was told that 'Our object is to continue until there
[[Indian]] in [[Canada]] that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there</p>
<p>question, and there is no [[Indian]] Department.' This, together with the resid
policy, demonstrates a clear disregard for the moral status of [[Aboriginal]]s. It,</p>
<p>ignores this status by the fact that assimilation programmes are designed to
amoral savage.</p>
<p>The only way to interpret the actions of [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]] is t
blatant denials of justice. The sanctioned deceitfulness of the early [[Indian]]
policies, the paternalism of the [[Indian]] Act, and the utter denial of the con
autonomy in the assimilation programmes signify far more than contempt f
communities. One can be contemptuous of persons without violating their a
privacy. One can simply leave them alone. The significance of contempt, in t
[[Canadian]] [[government]], is that it created an atmosphere in which a blindness
developed and formalized into law. The [[government]]'s use of law has been eith
[[Aboriginal]] people as [[Aboriginal]]s, or to eliminate them, period.
What have the law and legal language been to the [[Aboriginal]] people, then</p>

unjust use of the law, adopting the language of rights is best interpreted as</p>
<p>move. The move is conciliatory, because it gives the same advantage to the do
as was once forcibly and arbitrarily taken by that society. It runs the risk of h</p>
<p>machinery that once was used to deny justice, to do so once again. Mor</p>
<p>language does not immediately call for an examination of the morally outrag</p>
<p>against the community and culture. Rather, it calls for an examination of t
against law (i.e., against the formal legal institutions, the [[treaties]]). If the g

<p>[[Aboriginal]] Right: A Conciliatory Concept 137
But most importantly, [[Aboriginal]] peoples have come to use a system of concepts and
principles that have been instru[[mental]] in the destruction of their culture and identity. As a</p>
<p>strategic move to communicate, coming to use the language of the courts must be
understood to be an act of choosing to bear, without recognition, the humiliation and
despair that come from being denied moral status. Being conciliatory, in this respect, does
not so much signify an attitude of compromise but of magnanimity.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In contexts where conciliation by the disadvantaged group has led to systematic
misunderstanding of that group, a special dispensation of justice needs to be considered. We</p>
<p>should acknowledge that apart from the conciliatory move, [[Aboriginal]] claim would
probably still have not gained any purchase on the dominant community's sensibilities. We
should not ignore the conciliatory nature of present [[Aboriginal]] claim, for, if we understand</p>
<p>why it is conciliatory and how the conciliation developed, we cannot fail to recognise the
extent of the injustice that demands righting.</p>

[24] This now famous statement was made during the [[1992]] Constitutional hearings with the then Minister of
Constitutional Affairs, Joe Clark.</p>
<p>[25] The fact that '[[Aboriginal]] right' or 'inherent right to self-[[government]]' would not be defined prior to its
entrenchment in the Constitution was part of a package of proposals that the [[Canadian]] people were asked to
vote on in a referendum. The package was called the 'Charlottetown Accord.'</p>
<p>[26] Winona Stevenson as cited on the [[Canadian]] Broadcasting Corporation documentary, 'Legacy.'
[27] Stevenson is playing on an ambiguity as far as I can tell. On the one hand, 'inherent right' is used in the context</p>
<p>of association with [[Canada]]. Her definition, on the other hand, has only to do with what it means for an
[[Aboriginal]] person to govern him or herself.</p>

<p>Overholt and J. Baird Callicot with Ojibwa Texts by William Jones ([[1982]]) Clothed in Fur and Other Tales
([[New]] York, University Press of [[America]]), p.153, shows how the stories and myths of the Ojibwa people were
used to educate people of all ages in accordance with the view that the Ojibwa belonged to a wider community of
smaller communities (species). The idea that a human being could transform into a beaver or coyote, was meant
to convey the notion that humanity was constituted of persons with a sense of dignity and place no less than any</p>
<p>other creatures. Hence, a sense of respect for all creatures together with a sense that the place in which one was
nurtured was critical in developing the identity of an Ojibwa.</p>

become known as the 'Land Ethic.'Aldo Leopold ([[1949]]) A Sand County Almanac (Oxford, Oxford University

justified in claiming that the views expressed by [[Aboriginal]] peoples are so alien that they are unintelligible to the</p>
<p>[[Europe]]an-based liberal. My taking the trouble to mention this has to do with several encounters with those</p>
