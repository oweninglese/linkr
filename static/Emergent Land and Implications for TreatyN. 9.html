<p>ABSTRACT. In [[1905]] and [[1906]], the [[Cree]] of the southwestern James [[Bay]] region signed [[Treaty]] No. 9 whereby they relinquished</p>
<p>to the [[Canadian]] [[government]] their claim to the lands south of the Albany River (the northern boundary of the province of
[[Ontario]] at the time). The official text of [[Treaty]] No. 9 made no mention of land submerged below water cover, and thus the [[Cree]]
did not relinquish such regions at that time. By contrast, the [[Cree]] of the northwestern James [[Bay]] and southwestern Hudson [[Bay]]</p>
<p>region who signed the [[1929]]-30 Adhesions to [[Treaty]] No. 9 relinquished their claims to "land covered by water" for the area
bounded on the south by the northerly limit of [[Treaty]] No. 9, as this clause was specifically included in the text of the adhesion.</p>
<p>The issue of "land covered by water" is significant because the western James [[Bay]] region has been, and will continue to be,
subject to sea level changes associated with ongoing adjustments due to the last ice age and modern global warming signals.</p>
<p>In the absence of detailed maps, we used models of these processes, constrained by available geophysical and geodetic data
sets, to retrodict shoreline changes and the rate of land emergence over the last two centuries within the boundaries specified</p>
<p>by [[Treaty]] No. 9. We also project shoreline migration to the end of the 21st century within the same region. The rate of land</p>
<p>emergence since [[1905]] in the area south of the Albany River is estimated as -3.0 km2/yr. Over the next century, land will</p>
<p>continue to emerge in this region at a mean rate of -1.4 km2/yr. This emergent land should be a subject of consideration within</p>
<p>any comprehensive land claim put forward by the [[Cree]]; in this regard, it will be interesting to see how the [[Canadian]] judicial
system and the Comprehensive Claims Branch handle the novel issue of emergent land.</p>

<p>RÉSUMÉ. En [[1905]] et [[1906]], les Cris du sud-ouest de la région de la baie James ont signé le Traité n° 9, par le biais duquel ils
ont cédé au gouvernement du [[Canada]] leur droit de revendication des terres au sud de la rivière Albany (la limite nord de la
province de l'[[Ontario]] à l'époque). Le texte officiel du Traité n° 9 ne faisait aucune mention des terres submergées sous l'eau,</p>
<p>si bien que les Cris n'ont pas renoncé à ces régions à ce moment-là. En revanche, les Cris du nord-ouest de la baie James et
du sud-ouest de la baie d'Hudson qui ont signé les adhésions au Traité n° 9 ([[1929]]-[[1930]]) ont renoncé à leurs revendications</p>
<p>aux « terres recouvertes d'eau » dans la zone délimitée au sud par la limite nord du Traité n° 9, puisque cette clause était
expressément incluse dans le texte de l'adhésion. La question des « terres recouvertes d'eau » est importante parce que l'ouest</p>
<p>de la région de la baie James a été et continuera d'être assujettie aux variations du niveau de la mer liées aux ajustements
continus découlant de la dernière période glaciaire et des récents signes de réchauffement planétaire. En l'absence de cartes
détaillées, nous avons utilisé des modèles de ces processus, limités par les ensembles de données géophysiques et géodésiques
disponibles, pour déterminer de façon rétrospective les changements du littoral et le taux d'émergence des terres au cours
des deux derniers siècles dans les limites précisées dans le Traité n° 9. Nous faisons également une projection de la migration</p>
<p>du littoral jusqu'à la fin du XXIe siècle dans cette même région. Le taux d'émergence des terres depuis [[1905]] dans la région
au sud de la rivière Albany est estimé à -3,0 km2/année. Au cours du prochain siècle, les terres continueront d'émerger dans</p>
<p>cette région au taux moyen de -1,4 km2/année. Ces terres émergées devraient être prises en compte dans toute revendication</p>
<p>territoriale globale présentée par les Cris. À cet égard, il sera intéressant de voir comment le système judiciaire canadien et la
Direction générale des revendications globales traiteront cette nouvelle question des terres émergées.</p>

<p>The earth is currently in an interglacial period, yet the
James [[Bay]] region is subject to ongoing adjustment in consequence of the ice age that ended about 8000 years ago.
Specifically, this region, which was once covered by an ice

<p>last glacial cycle, is currently experiencing a postglacial
rebound of the solid crust at rates of approximately 1 cm/yr</p>
<p>(Mitrovica et al., [[2000]]). This postglacial rebound gives rise
to a land emergence, or alternatively a sea level fall, that
is accompanied by shoreline migration. This migration has
been active since the region became ice-free and is responsible for the raised late Holocene beach terraces that perof f HUDSON y</p>
