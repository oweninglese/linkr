<h3>[[general topics/PLACES/WASHINGTON]] ([[[[Reuters]]]])</h3>
<h4>- Three [[[[research]]]]ers from [[[[China]]]]'s [[[[Wuhan]]]] Institute of Virology (WIV) sought hospital care in [[[[November]]]] [[[[2019]]]], a month before [[[[China]]]] reported the first cases of [[[[COVID]]]]-19, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing a U.S. intelligence report.</h4>
<p>The newspaper said the previously undisclosed report - which provides fresh details on the number of [[[[research]]]]ers affected, the timing of their illnesses, and their hospital visits - may add weight to calls for a broader investigation into whether the [[[[COVID]]]]-19 [[[[virus]]]] could have escaped from the laboratory.</p>

<h4>The Journal</h4>
<p>said current and former officials familiar with the intelligence expressed a range of views about the strength of the report's supporting evidence, with one unnamed person saying it needed "further investigation and additional corroboration."</p>
<p>The first cases of what would eventually be known as [[[[COVID]]]]-19 were reported at the end of [[[[December]]]] [[[[2019]]]] in the central [[[[Chinese]]]] city of [[[[Wuhan]]]], where the advanced laboratory specialising in [[[[corona[[[[virus]]]]]]]] [[[[research]]]] is located.</p>

<h4>[[[[Chinese]]]] scientists</h4>
<p>and officials have consistently rejected the lab leak hypothesis, saying SARS-CoV-2 could have been circulating in other regions before it hit [[[[Wuhan]]]], and might have even entered [[[[China]]]] from another country via imported frozen food shipments or wildlife trading.</p>
<p>[[[[China]]]]'s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said on Monday that it was "completely untrue" that three members of staff at WIV had fallen ill.</p>
<p>"The [[[[United]]]] [[[[States]]]] continues to hype up the lab leak theory," he said. "Does it care about traceability or is it just trying to distract attention?"</p>
<p>The Journal report came on the eve of a meeting of the World Health Organization's decision-making body, which is expected to discuss the next phase of an investigation into the origins of [[[[COVID]]]]-19.</p>
<p>Asked about the report, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said via email that the organisation's technical teams were now deciding on the next steps. He said further study was needed into the role of animal markets as well as the lab leak hypothesis.</p>
<h5>A U.S.</h5>
<p>National Security Council spokeswoman had no comment on the report but said the Biden administration continued to have "serious questions about the earliest days of the [[[[COVID]]]]-19 [[[[pandemic]]]], including its origins within the Peoples Republic of [[[[China]]]]."</p>
<p>She said the U.S. [[[[government]]]] was working with the WHO and other member states to support an expert-driven evaluation of the [[[[pandemic]]]]'s origins "that is free from interference or politicization."</p>
<p>"We're not going to make pronouncements that prejudge an ongoing WHO study into the source of SARS-CoV-2, but we've been clear that sound and technically credible theories should be thoroughly evaluated by international experts," she said.</p>
<p>A joint study into the origins of [[[[COVID]]]]-19 by the WHO and [[[[China]]]] published at the end of [[[[March]]]] said it was "extremely unlikely" that it had escaped from a lab.</p>
<p>But [[[[China]]]] was accused of failing to disclose raw data on early [[[[COVID]]]]-19 cases to the WHO team, and the [[[[United]]]] [[[[States]]]], the [[[[Europe]]]]an Union and other [[[[Western]]]] countries called on [[[[Beijing]]]] to grant "full access" to independent experts.</p>
<p>A State Department fact sheet released near the end of the [[[[Trump]]]] administration said "the U.S. [[[[government]]]] has reason to believe that several [[[[research]]]]ers inside the WIV became sick in autumn [[[[2019]]]], before the first identified case of the outbreak, with symptoms consistent with both [[[[COVID]]]]-19 and common seasonal illnesses." It did not say how many [[[[research]]]]ers.</p>
