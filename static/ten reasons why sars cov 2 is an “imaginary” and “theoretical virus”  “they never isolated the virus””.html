<h4><strong>#10 [[SARS-CoV-2]] the Theoretical Virus: Previous Corona[[virus]]es Have Not Been Isolated</strong></h4>
<h4>The [[[[Spanish]]]] [[health]] journal <em>Salud</em> published a great article in [[[[November]] [[2020]]]] entitled “Frauds and falsehoods in the medical field” where it exposes the lack of evidence not only for the isolation of [[SARS-CoV-2]], but also for the isolation of other past [[corona[[virus]]]]es (unofficial translation <a href="https://www.[[flu]]oridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-[[health]]-[[[[science]]]]-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification/">here</a>). The scam runs deep. [[Jon Rappoport]] has done great work exposing how the exact same scam blueprint was played out in the [[1980]]s (with [[[[Fauci]]]] in charge, leading the fraud) when scientists asserted there was a new [[virus]] called [[HIV]], and it was causing [[AIDS]]. The [[[[COVID]]]] #scamdemic greatly mimics other #historical #fake #[[pandemic]]s such as the [[[1976]] swine [[flu]] [[pandemic]]]. The article is <em>Salud</em> states:</h4>
<h4><em>“The [[genetic sequences]] used in [[PCRs]] to detect suspected [[SARS-CoV-2]] and to diagnose cases of illness and [[death]] attributed to [[[[COVID]]-19]] are present in dozens of sequences of the [[human genome]] itself and in those of about a hundred [[[[microbes]]]]. And that includes the [[initiators]] or [[primers]], the most extensive fragments taken at random from their supposed “[[genome]]” and even the so-called “[[target genes]]” allegedly specific to the “new [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]]”. The test is worthless and all “positive” results obtained so far should be scientifically #invalidated and communicated to those affected; and if they are deceased, to their relatives.

<h4><em>The Imaginary and Theoretical Virus known as [[SARS-CoV-2]], a concept which has been used by the [[NWO]] ([[[[New]] World Order]]) controllers to shut down the world, is becoming more and more exposed as the months go by.</em></h4>
<h4><em>Although those who believe in the <strong>[[[[COVID]]]] cult</strong> – both those orchestrating the scamdemic and those blindly following along – will insist the #[[virus]] is real, the truth is that there has still been no compelling or conclusive evidence that a real #SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]] exists.</em></h4>
<h4><em>Admissions by [[government]]al scientists and organizations worldwide, as well as omissions and obfuscations by those same people and agencies, reveal the shocking truth. As hard as it may be for the <strong>[[COVID]] cultists</strong> to admit, the emperor truly has no clothes.</em></h4>
<h4><em><strong>There is no [[virus]]</strong>, other than a digital, theoretical abstraction made on a [[computer]] from a #genomic #[[database]]. <strong>The [[virus]] has never been #isolated, #purified, #sequenced, #characterized and proven 100% to exist.</strong></em></h4>
<h4><em>Don’t believe it? That’s okay; it’s good to be skeptical. See the evidence below for yourself and make up your own mind.</em></h4>
<h4><strong>#1 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: The Virus Has Never Been Isolated According to [[Koch’s Postulates]] or [[River’s Postulates]]</strong></h4>
<h4>We’ll start with this, because this is the [[corn]]erstone of the whole scam. All the following information and evidence below stems from the fact the so-called experts have never isolated and purified the [[virus]] according to the [[gold]] standard of <a href="https://thefreedomarticles.com/[[covid-19]]-umbrella-term-fake-[[pandemic]]-not-1-disease-cause/">Koch’s postulates</a>, or even the modified [[River’s Postulates.]]  [[Koch’s postulates]] are:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>The [[microorganism]] must be identified in all individuals affected by the disease, but not in [[health]]y individuals.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The #microorganism can be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in culture.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>When introduced into a [[health]]y individual, the cultured microorganism must cause disease.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The microorganism must then be re-isolated from the experi[[mental]] host, and found to be identical to the original microorganism.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><a href="https://paramedicsworld.com/virology-notes/introduction-to-virology-rivers-postulates/medical-paramedical-studynotes">River’s postulates</a> were proposed by <strong>Thomas M. River</strong> in [[1973]] to establish the role of a specific [[virus]] as the cause of a specific disease. They are modifications of Koch’s postulates. They are as follows:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>The [[viral]] agent must be found either in the host’s (animal or plant) body [[flu]]ids at the time of disease or in cells showing lesions specific to that disease.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The host material with the [[[[viral]] agent]] used to inoculate the [[health]]y host (test organism) must be free of any other microorganism.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>The [[viral]] agent obtained from the infected host must produce the specific disease in a suitable [[health]]y host, and/or provide evidence of infection by inducing the formation of [[[[antibodies]]]] specific to that agent.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Similar material ([[viral]] particle) from the newly infected host (test organism) must be isolated and capable of transmitting the specific disease to other [[health]]y hosts.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<h4>Whichever set of postulates is used, SARS-CoV-2 fails the test. <strong>Dr. Andrew Kaufman</strong> does a great job explaining why in this <a href="https://www.bitchute.com/video/eOGvhrGTVq6N/">video</a>. The [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] SARS-CoV-2 (allegedly causing the disease [[[[COVID]]-19]]) has not been shown to be present only in sick people and not in [[health]]y ones.</h4>
<h4><strong>The [[virus]] has never been isolated, which must be done with proper equipment such as [[electron microscopes]]</strong> and which cannot be achieved through CT scans (as the [[Chinese]] were using) and the flawed RT-PCR test.</h4>
<h4>The [[January]] 24th [[2020]] study published in the <em>[[New]] England Journal of Medicine</em> entitled <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa[[2001]]017"><em>A Novel [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] from Patients with Pneumonia in [[China]], [[2019]]</em></a> describes how the scientists arrived at the idea of [[[[COVID]]-19]]: they took lung [[flu]]id samples and extracted [[RNA]] from them using the [[PCR]] test. It admits that the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] failed Koch’s postulates:</h4>
<h4><em>“Further development of accurate and rapid methods to identify unknown respiratory pathogens is still needed … our study does not fulfill Koch’s postulates.”</em></h4>
<h4><strong>#2 [[SARS-CoV-2]] the Theoretical Virus: Top [[Chinese]] Scientist Admitted They Never Isolated the Virus</strong></h4>
<h4>All claims that the SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]] has been isolated have turned out to be unsubstantiated. Meanwhile, there have been actual admissions by officials that they haven’t isolated it. The chief [[epidemiologist]] of the [[[[Chinese]] [[CDC]]]] (Center for Disease Control) admitted <em>“they didn’t isolate the [[virus]]”</em> in this <a href="https://twitter.com/EEccetera/status/13542089133[[1552]]8705">video clip</a>.</h4>
<h4><strong>#3 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[CDC]] Stated No Quantified Isolate Was Available</strong></h4>
<h4>The US [[CDC]] (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in its [[July]] [[2020]] report [<em>[[CDC]] [[2019]]-Novel Corona[[virus]] ([[2019]]-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel</em>] admits that it had been <strong>running PCR tests based not on an actual [[viral]] isolate (an actual sample or specimen taken from an infected human), but rather <em>“stocks”</em> of <em>“transcribed [[RNA]]”</em> taken from a gene bank to <em>“mimic clinical specimen”</em>:</strong></h4>
<h4><em>“Since no quantified [[virus]] isolates of the [[2019]]-nCoV were available for [[CDC]] use at the time the test was developed and this study conducted, assays designed for detection of the [[2019]]-nCoV [[RNA]] were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length [[RNA]] (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer ([[RNA]] copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and [[viral]] transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.” (pg.43)</em></h4>
<h4><strong>#4 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[CDC]] Admitted They Made a Digital Virus of 30,000 Base Pairs Using 37 Actual Sample Base Pairs</strong></h4>
<h4>As covered in my previous article <a href="https://thefreedomarticles.com/sars-cov-2-stitched-together-frankenstein-[[virus]]/"><em>SARS-CoV-2: The Stitched Together, Frankenstein Virus</em></a>, the [[CDC]] has already admitted that SARS-CoV-2 is a [[computer]]-generated digital [[virus]], not a real living [[virus]]. As I wrote:</h4>
<h4><em>“In other words, it is a Frankenstein [[virus]] which has been concocted and stitched together using genomic [[database]] sequences (some [[viral]], some not). It has never been properly purified and isolated so that it could be sequenced from end-to-end once derived from living tissue; instead, it’s just digitally assembled from a [[computer]] [[database]]. In this paper, the [[CDC]] scientists state they took just 37 base pairs from a genome of 30,000 base pairs which means that about 0.001% of the [[viral]] sequence is derived from actual living samples or real bodily tissue. In other words, they took these 37 segments and put them into a [[computer]] program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs. This [[computer]]-generation step constitutes scientific fraud.”</em></h4>
<h4>In this article [<em>In [[June]] Study [[CDC]] Scientists Make 2 [[COVID]] Admissions that Destroy Official Narrative</em>] I reveal how the [[CDC]] admitted in their <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/6/20-0516_article">paper</a> that they extrapolated their make-believe [[virus]]. Here is the quote:</h4>
<h4><em>“Whole-Genome Sequencing</em></h4>
<h4><em>We designed 37 pairs of nested PCRs spanning the genome on the basis of the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] reference sequence (GenBank accession no. NC045512). We extracted nucleic acid from isolates and amplified by using the 37 individual nested PCRs.”</em></h4>
<h4>Another way to say this is that the “[[virus]]” has been constructed using a technique called <strong>de novo assembly</strong> which is a method for constructing genomes from a large number of (short or long) [[DNA]] fragments, with no <em>a priori</em> knowledge of the correct sequence or order of those fragments. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.[[flu]]oridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-[[health]]-[[[[science]]]]-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification/">here</a>.</h4>
<h4><strong>#5 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[Europe]]an Corman-Drosten Paper Used an “In Silico” Genome of an “In Silico” Virus</strong></h4>
<h4>The original <a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/[[1560]]-7917.ES.[[2020]].25.3.[[2000]]045">Corman-Drosten paper</a> <strong>admits they used a theoretical [[virus]] sequence for all their work and calculations. They, like the [[CDC]] and every [[government]] and agency, claim this is only because no isolate was ever available</strong>. I wonder if any of these scientists every asked WHY the isolate has never been available?</h4>
<h4><em>“In the present case of [[2019]]-nCoV, [[virus]] isolates or samples from infected patients have so far not become available to the international public [[health]] community.”</em></h4>
<h4>A subsequent study highlighting fatal flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper was published entitled <a href="https://www.[[research]]gate.net/publication/346483715_External_peer_review_of_the_RTPCR_test_to_detect_SARS-CoV-2_reveals_10_major_scientific_flaws_at_the_molecular_and_methodological_level_consequences_for_false_positive_results"><em>External peer review of the RTPCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2 reveals 10 major scientific flaws at the molecular and methodological level: consequences for false positive results</em></a>. It highlights how the authors used <strong>in silico</strong> or theoretical sequences from [[computer]] banks, not real isolated samples from infected people. “In silico” is pseudo-Latin for “theoretical”; in plain English, synonyms for theoretical are “imaginary” and “make-believe.”</h4>
<h4><em>“The first and major issue is that the novel Corona[[virus]] SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named [[2019]]-nCoV and in [[February]] [[2020]] named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of [[virus]] experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in [[China]], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic [[RNA]] of the [[virus]] was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]]es or full length [[RNA]] thereof.</em></h4>
<h4><em>…</em></h4>
<h4><em>Nevertheless <strong>these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid [[virus]]. This model was based on the assumption that the novel [[virus]] is very similar to SARS-CoV from [[2003]]</strong> (Hereafter named SARS-CoV-1) as both are beta-[[corona[[virus]]]]es … in short, <strong>a design relying merely on close genetic relatives does not fulfill the aim for a “robust diagnostic test” as cross reactivity and therefore false-positive results will inevitably occur.</strong> Validation was only done in regards to in silico(theoretical) sequences and within the laboratory-setting, and not as required for in-vitro diagnostics with isolated genomic [[viral]] [[RNA]]. This very fact hasn’t changed even after 10 months of introduction of the test into routine diagnostics.” (__emphasis added)</em></h4>
<h4><strong>#6 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[UK]] Government Couldn’t Produce Evidence</strong></h4>
<h4>The [[government]]s of many nations around the world couldn’t seem to come up with a real [[virus]] either when challenged to do so. More evidence proving the “[[virus]]” is constructed on a [[computer]] [[database]] from a digital gene bank comes from [[[France]]s Leader], who questioned the [[UK]] MHRA (Medicines and [[Healthcare]] products Regulatory Agency) whether a real isolated [[virus]] was used to make the [[COVID]] [[vaccine]]. Leader found that the WHO protocols that [[Pfizer]] used to produce the m[[RNA]] do not appear to identify any nucleotide sequences that are unique to the SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]]. Leader asked if the “[[virus]]” was actually a [[computer]] generated genomic sequence, and ultimately the MHRA confirmed they had no real specimen:</h4>
<h4><em>“The [[DNA]] template does not come directly from an isolated [[virus]] from an infected person.”</em></h4>
<h4>In [[July]] [[2020]], a group of concerned academics <a href="https://www.resetourplanet.com/covid19-something-real-or-fake-what-do-we-know/">wrote a letter</a> to the [[UK]] Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which they asked him to produce independently peer reviewed scientific evidence proving that the SARS-CoV-2 “[[virus]]” has been isolated. To date they have not received a reply. Similarly, [[UK]] [[research]]er <a href="https://cv[[pandemic]]investigation.com/[[2020]]/09/[[covid-19]]-evidence-of-fraud-medical-malpractice-acts-of-domestic-terrorism-and-breaches-of-human-rights/">Andrew Johnson</a> made a Freedom of Information Request to Public Health England (PHE). He asked them to provide him with their records describing the isolation of a SARS-COV-2 [[virus]] to which <a href="https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/679566/response/[[1625]]332/attach/html/2/872%20FOI%20All%20records%20describing%20isolation%20of%20SARS%20COV%202.pdf.html">they responded</a>:</h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>“PHE can confirm it does not hold information in the way suggested by your request.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>#7 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[Australia]]n Government Couldn’t Produce Evidence</strong></h4>
<h4>In other Commonwealth nations it’s the exact same story. In [[Australia]] scientists from the <a href="https://www.doherty.edu.au/people">Doherty Institute</a> falsely announced that they had [isolated the SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]]]. When asked to clarify the scientists said:</h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>“We have short ([[RNA]]) sequences from the diagnostic test that can be used in the diagnostic tests.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h4>Perhaps this is the reason for this disclaimer by the [[[Australia]]n Government]:</h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>“The reliability of [[[[COVID]]-19]] tests is uncertain due to the limited evidence base…There is limited evidence available to assess the accuracy and clinical utility of available [[COVID]]-19 tests.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>#8 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[Canadian]] Government Couldn’t Produce Evidence</strong></h4>
<h4>[[Research]]er <strong>Christine Massey</strong> made a similar Freedom Of Information request in [[Canada]], to which the [[[Canadian]] Government replied]:</h4>
<h4><em>“Having completed a thorough search, we regret to inform you that we were unable to locate any records responsive to your request.”</em></h4>
<h4>[The complete letter from [Health [[Canada]] / Santé [[Canada]] is on file]]</h4>
<h4><strong>#9 SARS-Cov-2 the Theoretical Virus: Over 40 Institutions Worldwide Can’t Answer the Basic Question</strong></h4>
<h4>In fact, <strong>Christine Massey</strong> and her colleague in [[New]] [[Zealand]]</h4>
<h4><em>“have been submitting Freedom of Information requests to various institutions in [[[[Canada]]]], [[NZ]], [[[[Australia]]]], [[Germany]], the [[[[U.K.]]]], the [[U.S.]] etc., seeking any records that describe the isolation of a “[[[[COVID]]-19] ][[virus]]” (aka “[[SARS-CoV-2]]”) from an unadulterated sample taken from a diseased human … As of [[December]] 16, [[2020]], &gt;40 institutions in [[Canada]], [[U.S.]], [[New]] [[Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[U.K.]], England, [[Scotland]], Wales, [[Ireland]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Europe]]an [[CDC]] have provided their responses, and none could locate any record describing the isolation of any “[[[[COVID]]-19]] [[virus]]” aka “SARS-COV-2” directly from a diseased patient.”</em></h4>
<h4>Massey posts their replies <a href="https://www.[[flu]]oridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-[[health]]-[[[[science]]]]-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.[[flu]]oridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-[[health]]-[[[[science]]]]-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification/">here</a>.</h4>

</blockquote>
<h4>Their report analyzed human [[corona[[virus]]]]es 229E (said to have been isolated in [[1965]]), OC43 (in [[1967]]), SARS-CoV (in [[2003]]), NL63 (in [[2004]]), HKU1 (in [[2005]]) and MERS-CoV (in [[2012]]). And just to repeat in case you missed it: they discovered the <strong>alleged sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are found in both humans and bacteria!</strong> This means all the various in silico models of SARS-CoV-2 contain existing human genetic sequences, <strong>so it is little wonder that people test positive when the primer or standard being tested against contains human sequences.</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Conclusion: The [[COVID]] Cult is a Colossal Fraud and Superstition</strong></h4>
<h4>How did this all start? [[Chinese]] scientists took lung [[flu]]id samples and claimed they had discovered a novel or new [[virus]]. The Gates-Rockefeller WHO backed them up. In the WHO’s [Novel Corona[[virus]] [[2019]]-nCov Situation Report 1], they state:</h4>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>“The [[[[Chinese]]]] authorities identified a new type of [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]], which was isolated on [[7 [[January]] [[2020]]]]……On [[12 [[January]] [[2020]]]], [[[[China]]]] shared the #genetic #sequence of the #novel [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] for countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits.”</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<h4>With the evidence presented above, the WHO’s assertions and claims are utterly baseless. They constitute outright fraud.</h4>
<h4>The world has been shut down over a lie – a coldly calculated, carefully curated lie – that was simulated and war-gamed for decades in advance. The [[COVID]] cult is an irrational superstition based on nothing but in silico, theoretical, make-believe [[viral]] sequences. Yet, the real-world consequences for millions who have been thrown into stress, despair, [[poverty]], joblessness, alcoholism and suicide is anything but theoretical.</h4>
