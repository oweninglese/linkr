title: The science suggests a wuhan lab leak</p>

<h3>The #[[Covid]]-19 pathogen has a [[genetic footprint]] that has never been observed in a natural #[[[[corona[[virus]]]]]].</h3>
<p>By [[Steven Quay]] and [[Richard Muller]]

<h2>The possibility</h2>
<p>that the [[[[pandemic]]]] began with an escape from the [[[[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology]] is attracting fresh attention. [[President]] [[Biden]] has asked the national intelligence community to redouble efforts to investigate.</p>
<p>Much of the public discussion has focused on circumstantial evidence: mysterious #illnesses in late [[[[2019]]]]; the lab’s work intentionally supercharging #[[virus]]es to increase lethality (known as “[[gain of function]]” [[research]]). The [[[[Chinese]] Communist Party]] has been reluctant to release relevant information. Reports based on [[U.S.]] intelligence have suggested the lab collaborated on projects with the [[[[Chinese]] military]].</p>
<p>But the most compelling reason to favor the[[ lab leak]] hypothesis is firmly based in [[[[science]]]]. In particular, consider the #genetic #fingerprint of [[CoV-2]], the [[novel [[corona[[virus]]]]]] responsible for the #disease [[[[COVID]]-19]]. </p>
<p>In #gain-of-function [[research]], a #microbiologist can increase the #lethality of a [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] enormously by splicing a special sequence into its genome at a prime location. Doing this leaves no trace of #manipulation. But it alters the #[[virus]] [[spike protein]], rendering it easier for the [[[[virus]]]] to inject #genetic material into the victim cell. Since [[[[1992]]]] there have been at least 11 separate #[[experiment]]s adding a special #sequence to the same location. The end result has always been #supercharged #[[virus]]es.</p>
<h2>A [[genome]]</h2>
<p>is a #blueprint for the factory of a cell to make proteins. The language is made up of three-letter “words,” 64 in total, that represent the 20 different [[amino acids]]. For example, there are six different words for the [[amino acid]] [[arginine]], the one that is often used in #supercharging #[[virus]]es. Every [[cell]] has a different preference for which word it likes to use most.</p>
<p>In the case of the [[gain-of-function]] supercharge, other #sequences could have been [[spliced]] into this same site. Instead of a #CGG-CGG (known as “[[double CGG]]”) that tells the #protein factory to make two #arginine [[amino acids]] in a row, you’ll obtain equal #lethality by #splicing any one of 35 of the other two-word combinations for double #arginine. If the insertion takes place naturally, say through recombination, then one of those 35 other sequences is far more likely to appear; #CGG is rarely used in the class of #[[corona[[virus]]]]es that can recombine with #CoV-2.</p>
<p>In fact, in the entire class of #[[corona[[virus]]]]es that includes #CoV-2, the #CGG-CGG combination has never been found naturally. That means the common method of #[[virus]]es picking up new s[[kill]]s, called #recombination, cannot operate here. A #[[virus]] simply cannot pick up a #sequence from another [[virus]] if that sequence isn’t present in any other #[[virus]].</p>
<p>Although the double [[CGG]] is suppressed naturally, the opposite is true in laboratory work. The insertion #sequence of choice is the double CGG. That’s because it is readily available and convenient, and scientists have a great deal of experience #inserting it. An additional advantage of the [[double CGG]] sequence compared with the other 35 possible choices: It creates a useful beacon that permits the #scientists to track the #insertion in the #laboratory.</p>
<h2>Now the damning fact.</h2>
<p>It was this exact sequence that appears in #CoV-2. Proponents of [[zoonotic]] origin must explain why the novel #[[[[corona[[virus]]]]]], when it mutated or recombined, happened to pick its least favorite combination, the double CGG. Why did it #replicate the choice the lab’s #gain-of-function #[[research]]ers would have made?</p>
<p>Yes, it could have happened #randomly, through #mutations. But do you believe that? At the minimum, this fact—that the #[[[[corona[[virus]]]]]], with all its random possibilities, took the #rare and #unnatural combination used by human [[research]]ers—implies that the leading theory for the #origin of the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] must be laboratory escape.</p>
<p>When the lab’s [[Shi Zhengli]] and colleagues published a paper in [[[[February]] [[2020]]]] with the [[virus]]’s partial #genome, they omitted any mention of the special sequence that supercharges the [[virus]] or the rare [[double CGG]] section. Yet the #fingerprint is easily identified in the data that accompanied the paper. Was it omitted in the hope that nobody would notice this evidence of the #gain-of-function #origin?</p>
<p>But in a matter of weeks virologists [[Bruno Coutard]] and colleagues <a href="https://www.[[research]]gate.net/publication/339[[1538]]57_The_spike_glycoprotein_of_the_new_[[corona[[virus]]]]_[[2019]]-nCoV_contains_a_furin-like_cleavage_site_absent_in_CoV_of_the_same_clade">published</a> their discovery of the sequence in #CoV-2 and its novel supercharged site. Double CGG is there; you only have to look. They comment in their paper that the protein that held it “may provide a #gain-of-function” capability to the [[virus]], “for efficient spreading” to #humans.</p>
<h2>There is additional scientific evidence</h2>
<p>that points to CoV-2’s #gain-of-function origin. The most compelling is the dramatic differences in the genetic diversity of #CoV-2, compared with the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]es]] responsible for #SARS and #MERS.</p>
<p>Both of those were confirmed to have a #natural #origin; the [[[[virus]]es]] evolved rapidly as they spread through the human population, until the most [[contagious forms]] dominated. #[[Covid]]-19 didn’t work that way. It appeared in #humans already adapted into an extremely #contagious version. No serious [[viral]] “improvement” took place until a minor variation occurred many months later in #England.</p>
<p>Such early #optimization is #unprecedented, and it suggests a long period of #adaptation that predated its [[public spread]]. [[Science]] knows of only one way that could be achieved: [[simulated natural evolution]], growing the [[virus]] on human cells until the optimum is achieved. That is precisely what is done in [[gain-of-function]] [[research]]. #Mice that are genetically modified to have the same #[[corona[[virus]]]] receptor as #humans, called “[[humanized mice]],” are repeatedly exposed to the [[virus]] to encourage adaptation.</p>
<p>The presence of the [[double CGG]] #sequence is strong #evidence of [[gene splicing]], and the absence of #diversity in the public #outbreak suggests #gain-of-function acceleration. The scientific evidence points to the conclusion that the #[[virus]] was developed in a #laboratory.</p>
