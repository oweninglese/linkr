<p>SUDBURY ([[April]] 25, [[2022]]) — The Anishinaabe term maamwizing refers to “people 
collaborating together.” While [[research]] can often be regarded as an 
overwhelming, intimidating, and even lonely process, Maamwizing holds a 
different view and, in turn, offers a unique experience for students. Discovery,
rooted in collaboration, encompasses the Maamwizing [[Indigenous]] [[Research]] 
Institute’s approach to honouring [[Indigenous]] worldviews through holistic 
relationships between nii’kinaagaanaa (all my relations), which includes all 
that is above, below, and around us, bringing these elements into our work.</p>
<p>“Knowledge sharing has always been a traditional practice among [[Indigenous]] 
communities, empowering generations of learners to explore and understand their 
world. It is akin to ceremony, informing our journey and relationship with the 
elements,” explains Dr. Susan Manitowabi, Interim Associate Vice-[[President]] with 
the Office of Academic and [[Indigenous]] Programs.</p>
<p>“Maamwizing recognizes the deliberate sharing of knowledge and [[history]] is a 
sacred transfer of wisdom, safeguarded by the principles of respect and 
reciprocity. The honour to learn from communities and receive this transfer must
be earned through relationship building and approached with humility. This is 
where Maamwizing always begins but never ends the relationship,” adds Dr. Joey 
Lynn Wabie, Maamwizing’s Interim Director, a Laurentian alumnus, and Assistant 
Professor in the School of [[Indigenous]] Relations. “Emphasizing that 
community-driven [[research]] is strength-based and relies on engagement to uncover 
answers and interpret knowledge that has always been, it is never deficit-based 
– we all move forward together in a sustainable way.”</p>
<p>Dr. Susan Manitowabi adds that “part of Maamwizing’s [[research]] involves exploring
ways of ‘Two-Eyed Seeing’ where we build reciprocal relationships that align 
[[research]] initiatives with the community’s needs. We grow, shift, and change as a
result of our relationships, but our journey never ends just because the 
[[research]] does; they go on forever.” This mantra is evident in the relationships 
shared by students, faculty, and allies.</p>
<p>Students play a central role within Maamwizing through Supporting [[Aboriginal]] 
Graduate Enhancements (SAGE) and are involved in a vast variety of [[research]] 
projects. Encouraged to attend committee meetings, students learn how to 
contribute to decision-making through collaborative engagement. Ophelia 
O’Donnell, a graduate student from Henvey Inlet First Nation, is actively 
working with Atikameksheng Anishnawbek First Nation in a community engagement 
role.</p>
<p>“I joined Maamwizing as a graduate student member and quickly learned that 
Maamwizing is more than a [[research]] institute. It is a group in which members can
collaborate, seek guidance, and support each other, beyond [[research]],” she 
states.</p>
<p>Alicia Williamson, a fourth-year [[Indigenous]] Social Work student hired to learn 
about [[Indigenous]] [[research]] at the graduate level, works closely with Dr. Wabie 
and shares insights on the impact that Maamwizing has had on her life.</p>
<p>“Maamwizing has been funda[[mental]] to my growth and exploration of [[research]] as an 
Anishinaabe student. It is integral for [[Indigenous]] students to see [[Indigenous]] 
people within spaces such as Laurentian University as leaders, [[research]]ers, and 
change-makers. It is even more critical that [[Indigenous]] students are provided 
access to opportunities that allow them to envision themselves in these 
positions.”</p>
<p>Maamwizing offers mentorship as well as a safe place for students to gather and 
grow. A home-away-from-home for many students, the unique and nurturing 
opportunity to learn alongside faculty and staff members leads to 
self-determination. Students are welcomed into the Maamwizing family with many 
graduates returning to teach [[Indigenous]] Programs or establish careers in the 
[[North]].</p>
<p>From an ally perspective, Dr. Kevin Fitzmaurice, Laurentian University’s Truth, 
and Reconciliation Coordinator and Affiliate Member of Maamwizing, recalls an 
early career experience where after listening to a teaching from Elder Michael 
Thrasher, Kevin requested a one-on-one interview with Michael to learn more. 
Michael agreed, and after their first interview, he invited Kevin to call and 
check in the following week. Kevin agreed, and after doing so, the invitation to
call the next week was extended again and then again. Decades later, Kevin 
continues to meet and learn from Michael. Community members and Knowledge 
Keepers are never considered [[research]] subjects to Maamwizing; they become family
and life-long friends.</p>
<p>Dr. Susan Manitowabi describes the Institute as offering students “a 
culturally-safe space to learn, thrive, and [[foster]] relationships as paramount to
the success of their [[research]]. We teach our students to learn from dreams and 
legends, to uncover stories that have been carried through generations. 
[[Indigenous]] [[research]] is uplifting; it is community and curiosity, and the 
understanding of [[research]] not as something to be feared but as something to be 
cherished. It is the gift of wisdom passed down through time immemorial.”</p>
<p>Beyond lifelong relationships, Maamwizing seeks to produce sustainable [[research]] 
outcomes for every community engaged. Dr. Joey-Lynn Wabie shares the reflection 
that “often, [[research]]ers will approach their projects with publication as their 
primary goal. At Maamwizing, learning together and sharing our discoveries is 
the goal. Sometimes, our [[research]] results look like a community manual rather 
than a scholarly piece where there is a first, second, and third author 
credited. Certainly, we must publish, but how we publish is framed by our desire
to share wisdom and to collaborate in the best interest of the community and as 
a good relative.”</p>
