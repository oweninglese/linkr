<p>First Nations must be top of mind for the federal [[government]] as [[Canada]] moves out of the [[COVID]]-19 [[pandemic]], say the seven candidates running for national chief of the Assembly of First Nations.</p>
<p>“Coming out of the [[corona[[virus]]]] we need to be part of rebuilding [[Canada]]’s economy. We need to be included as … equal partners at the table. We need to be sitting at those decision-making tables for all sectors,” said Dr. Cathy Martin.</p>
<p>Martin, an elected member for the Listuguj Mi’gmaq Government for three terms, says the AFN’s role is to be “that of support”. Consultation with the federal [[government]], however, must be done at the grassroots level and if that means with all 638 First Nation communities across [[Canada]] “then that’s what needs to be done.”</p>
<p>[[Regina]]ld Bellerose, former chief of the Muskowekwan First Nation, Sask., points to an economy that is changing and moving away from the brick and mortar business model of pre-[[COVID]]-19 towards a strong digital presence.</p>
<p>“First Nations need to get into that market. One of the areas that’s becoming very important (in communities) is the lack of connectivity,” he said.</p>
<p>That lack of connectivity became abundantly clear as northern and remote First Nations [[child]]ren found themselves disadvantaged as classes moved online when schools were closed in order to fight the spread of [[COVID]]-19, he said.</p>
<p>Bellerose doesn’t want to see businesses experience those same disadvantages.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get our communities connected. The AFN’s role is to play a supportive role, a facilitating role, helping to understand the lobby effort that’s going into all of this rebuilding of the [[Canadian]] economy,” said Bellerose.</p>
<p>“It’s rebuilding and (First Nations) need to be right in there, not an afterthought,” he said.</p>
<p>Many First Nation leaders expressed concerns when the [[pandemic]] first hit and the federal [[government]] started rolling out economic and personal support packages in [[March]] [[2020]].</p>
<p>It was unclear if First Nations businesses qualified for the support and if First Nations employees could access the [[Canada]] Emergency Relief Benefit.</p>
<p>Later, $305 million was set up in an [[Indigenous]] Community Support Fund, part of a much larger $27 billion initiative from the federal [[government]] in direct support to [[Canadian]] workers and businesses.</p>
<p>The [[Indigenous]] fund initially offered no details or clarity as to how the money would roll out. It only provided a promise to deploy “modest emergency funds” until a formula could be established. There was also no guarantee that more money would be coming if the [[pandemic]] continued.</p>
<p>First Nations again found themselves left behind last year when [[Ottawa]] announced funding for the remediation and reclamation of orphan wells in the western provinces.</p>
<p>The federal [[government]] flowed $1.7 billion of support through the provinces of Alberta, [[Saskatchewan]] and [[British]] Columbia, requiring First Nations to access that money through the provincial [[government]]s for their own oil servicing [[companies]] to do the work on First Nations’ land. None of those federal dollars were allocated specifically for First Nations’ work.</p>
<p>When $182 billion in federal infrastructure was given to the provincial [[government]]s, First Nations once more had to access those dollars through the provinces.</p>
<p>It was a [[battle]] that former [[Manitoba]] regional chief Kevin Hart fought as co-chair of the AFN’S [[COVID]]-19 national task force.</p>
<p>“We have many First Nations whose businesses do not fall under regular $180 billion announced in stimulus to regular [[Canadian]]s. I’m going to fight to ensure that those economic benefits and stimulus are entitled to our First Nation people as well,” said Hart.</p>
<p>He says this work will be part of his 100-day action plan if he wins the election.</p>
<p>Nishnawbe Aski Nation Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler says his “recovery framework” will address the post-[[pandemic]] needs and adds, “I envision the national organization, the AFN, to be able to support the work of our communities, making sure they have financial resources first of all to do the work.”</p>

<p>A recent survey released by a group of [[Indigenous]] economic organizations indicates that 72 per cent of the 825 [[Indigenous]] businesses that responded said they needed more financial support. However, 42 per cent said they did not apply for [[government]] programming because they needed grant support and not loans, because they were unable to take on additional debt. The data was collected between mid-[[December]] [[2020]] and [[February]] 1, 2021.</p>
<p>Fiddler points out that the work AFN has to facilitate is not limited to economics. The [[pandemic]] has taken a toll on the [[mental]] [[health]] of [[child]]ren and families, he said.</p>
<p>Former [[Ontario]] regional chief RoseAnne Archibald said that as an advocacy organization, the AFN should support First Nations as they build their economies coming out of the [[pandemic]] and tackle the increase in [[mental]] [[health]] and addictions that have come to the forefront.</p>
<p>“This [[pandemic]] has changed the way that we socialize, changed the way that we interact. We need proper resources and services to make sure that our people can emerge from the [[pandemic]] and rebuild their emotional and [[mental]] strength so that we can move forward in a good way,” said Archibald.</p>
<p>Along with increased addictions, Jodi Calahoo Stonehouse says isolation has also led to increased levels of domestic [[violence]].</p>
<p>“The AFN needs to be a space for resources to support our chiefs. That we are making sure every resource is available that they can connect with. We know that this is a critical time in recovery,” said Stonehouse, who is a councillor with the Michel First Nation in Alberta.</p>
<p>Former Tsuut’ina Nation Chief Lee Crow[[child]] emphasizes the medicine chest clause in [[Treaty]] 6 and the famine and pestilence clauses. A [[2018]] submission by the Maskwacis [[Cree]] to the [[United]] Nations’ Expert Mechanism on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples states that the medicine chest clause is “understood as providing a guarantee of all [[health]] care services, delivery, medicines, and supplies as required by [[Indigenous]] peoples;” while the famine and pestilence clause is “understood as providing a guarantee of appropriate and expedient support … in the face of famine or pestilences … such as chronic diseases, outbreaks, [[epidemic]]s and other similar [[health]] matters.”</p>
<p>“We have to always remind the [[government]] of what their responsibilities are … (and) under [[treaty]] they have an obligation… they have a responsibility to us,” said Crow[[child]].</p>
<p>He gives credit to the First Nations who have demanded [[vaccine]]s and have been “really pragmatic” about their approach in dealing with the [[corona[[virus]]]], which has included erecting checkpoints and implementing curfews.</p>
<p>Right now, an emergency situation on the Kashechewan First Nation “shows more work needs to be done,” said Hart. “There’s still a whole lot of unknowns when we talk about [[COVID]]-19.”</p>
<p>According to the [[Indigenous]] Services [[Canada]] website, as of [[June]] 15 there were 889 active cases on First Nations. As of [[June]] 1, the rate of reported active cases of [[COVID]]-19 in First Nations people living on a reserve is 188 per cent of the rate for the general [[Canadian]] population.</p>
<p>Chiefs will vote virtually for the next national chief of the AFN on [[July]] 7. Present National Chief Perry Bellegarde is not seeking a third term.</p>
