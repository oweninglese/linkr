<p>A coupe of months ago, when I asked Glenn Manser to report on Desert Mob, he 
told me that he’d really like to write a piece for me on Vincent Namatjira. Last
week, I received the article I’m posting below along with the images Glenn 
selected of recent works by the grandson of the great old man.</p>
<p>The timing was impeccable, with the announcement this week that the [[British]] 
Museum has acquired a work by Vincent. That was followed by another announcement
from Marshall Arts in Adelaide that their new solo show, Vincent’s first, has 
been purchased in toto by a state gallery to be named at a later date.</p>
<p>And so, I’m happy once again to share the podium here with Glenn as he describes
how…</p>
<p>The Namatjira Legend Lives On </p>
<p><a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.files.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/vincent-namatjira-in-country.jpg" title="link">image 1: Vincent-Namatjira-in-country (link #2)</a></p>
<p>There is something distinctly familiar, in a fashion, about Vincent Namatjira’s 
backstory.</p>
<p>Vincent was born in Alice Springs, and as a [[child]] he lived with his family in 
the [[Indigenous]] community, Hermannsburg within Ntaria country…However, at just 
six years of age his mother tragically passed away. With no available family to 
care for him Vincent and his older sister were taken into [[foster]] care, 
relocating to Perth in [[Western]] [[Australia]]. Vincent and his sister lived together 
in [[Indigenous]] [[foster]] care families throughout [[child]]hood^1<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/09/the-namatjira-legend-lives-on/#one" title="link">3</a></p>
<p>His [[child]]hood was one of bewilderment and loneliness.</p>
<p>What followed, however, has been entirely inspirational. At eighteen he returned
to Hermannsburg to reclaim his heritage. Observing his Aunty, Eileen Namatjira 
as she worked at the Hermannsburg Potters studio, an impressionable Namatjira 
subconsciously absorbed the inspiration of his ancestors.</p>
<p>After four years of work and study completing a land management course in 
Darwin, a starry eyed Vincent met his wife to be, Natasha through friends at the
Kanpi community. It was under the tutelage of Jimmy Pompey, Natasha’s father 
that Vincent began to explore the medium of painting.</p>
<p>Exploring traditional dot paintings of country, Vincent learnt about colour and 
tone, shapes and movement, reigniting an interest in the traditional works of 
his mother and in the classic watercolour landscapes of his grandfather.^2<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/09/the-namatjira-legend-lives-on/#two" title="link">4</a></p>
<p>More importantly his dormant desire to explore his own creative abilities 
emerged.</p>
<p>Although he never met his grandfather, inspiration was drawn from Albert 
Namatjira’s unique vision of country:</p>
<p>“I’m using his name – the same family name – but I’m pushing things forward. 
Instead of just painting scenery and stuff like that you can mix up your mind 
and paint other stuff too. Capturing now and the [[history]] too.”^3<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/09/the-namatjira-legend-lives-on/#three" title="link">5</a></p>
<p>A more urgent imperative has, however, been the foundation for his artistic 
emergence:</p>
<p>“I’m sitting down here with no anything. Broke, poor and everything, you know… 
with two daughters and my partner. I want to give them a good future.^4<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/09/the-namatjira-legend-lives-on/#four" title="link">6</a></p>
<p>Within the space of three short years, he has been represented in the following:</p>
<p>Broken Hill Regional Art Gallery, Outback Art Award – [[2013]] – shortlisted</p>
<p>John Fries Memorial Prize [[2013]] – finalist</p>
<p>30th Telstra National [[Aboriginal]] and Torres Strait Islander Art Award – [[2013]] – 
shortlisted</p>

<p>In [[May]], 2[[014]] he visited the [[Queen]]sland Art Gallery/Gallery of Modern Art to 
observe the watercolours of his grandfather. More profoundly it was Sir William 
Dargie’s [[1956]] Archibald Prize winning portrait of Albert Namatjira that impacted
him the most. The pride was obvious.</p>

<p>This experience provided the inspiration for his 2[[014]] Archibald Prize entry. 
Surprisingly, the judging panel, at times given to episodes of myopia, did not 
short list the portrait of artist and grandfather. Unsurprisingly this piece 
will now grace the walls of QAGOMA next to Dargie’s portrait. The irony is 
profound. One can imagine Albert Snr reaching out to his grandson and calmly 
warning, “Vincent, let me tell you a thing or two about these Sydney people.”</p>

<p>Eclectic though his subject matter is, Namatjira intuitively explores the 
historical and contemporary with equal sincerity and, where appropriate, wit. 
His portrait of Captain Cook with Declaration, acquired by the [[British]] Museum in
2[[014]], represents the explorer empathetically as if there is no blame to stain 
his reputation.</p>

<p>Amusingly, Tony Abbott’s [[2013]] election success is captured in a hand shake 
between Abbott and his mentor, John Howard. The time 6.05pm and even then 
victory was assured. The two dot paintings in the background symbolise Namatjira
and his wife, Natasha, observing this moment in [[history]] from a distance. He has,
therefore, inserted himself into this historic scene, and it serves as a 
powerful reminder that the people in the bush are watching proceedings in 
Canberra.</p>

<p>Karen Zadra from the Marshall Arts Gallery in Adelaide insightfully captures the
essence of Vincent’s zest for painting:</p>
<p>I realised that his paintings are as much a reflection of his personality as 
  they are portraits, landscapes or genre paintings. He’s a very warm, 
  considerate, humble and perceptive person. And nothing escapes his notice! 
  He’s a keen observer of current affairs, people, and [[history]]. The distillation
  of his observations comes through in his work and although his style is naïve,
  it is in no way senti[[mental]] or derivative. Instead, it speaks of a beautiful 
  mind, sensitive eye and a gift for elegant narrative. While Vincent is fully 
  aware of the dark side of life and [[history]], he chooses to see and express the 
  good. This is why – I believe – his works are so joyous and uplifting.^5<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/09/the-namatjira-legend-lives-on/#five" title="link">21</a></p>
<p>There is much more that could be said about this young man who proudly bears his
forebear’s name. Suffice it to say that like his cousins, Lenie and Kevin who 
continue to paint masterful watercolours for the Ngurratjuta Art Centre in Alice
Springs, Vincent is determined to chart his own course as an artist yet in doing
so remain true to the spirit of his famous grandfather.</p>
<p>“I hope my grandfather would be quite proud, maybe smiling down on me; because I
won’t let him go. I just keep carrying him on, his name and our family’s 
stories.”^6<a href="https://[[aboriginal]]artandculture.wordpress.com/2[[014]]/11/09/the-namatjira-legend-lives-on/#six" title="link">22</a></p>
<p>No doubt Albert Snr would be proud to embrace the success of yet another 
Namatjira.</p>
