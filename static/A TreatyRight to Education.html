<p>A [[Treaty]] Right to Education
Sheila Carr-Stewart
In the [[1870]]s, [[representative]]s of the [[Crown]] and First Nations negotiated Treaties 1 to 7.
Each included provision for education. This study focuses on the intent and expectations</p>
<p>of education as a [[treaty]] right by the original signatories and the current divergent
understandings. Today First Nations demand the fulfilment of their [[treaty]] right to
education while [[Canada]], despite constitutional authority and recent court decisions on
[[treaties]], administers educational services within the boundaries of its own legislation:
the [[Indian]] Act. Honouring [[treaty]] commitments offers hope for educational opportunities
and equity within the context of First Nation governance, traditions, and cultural milieu.</p>
<p>L'article porte sur les droits des [[Premier]]es nations en matiere d'education, tels qu'ils ont
ete reconnus par les traites 1 a 7 conclus dans les annees [[1870]]. Les [[Premier]]es nations</p>
<p>exigent les respect des dispositions des traites dans ce domaine. Mais en d6pit des
d6cisions r6centes des tribunaux, le [[Canada]] administre les services d'6ducation selon sa</p>
<p>Loi sur les Indiens. Le respect des obligations n6es d'un trait6 offre de l'espoir pour
l'enseignement et l'6quite dans le contexte de la gouvemance, des traditions et du milieu
culturel des [[Premier]]es nations.</p>
<p>From the time of early contact, [[representative]]s of First Nations and
[[Europe]]an sovereigns entered into peace and friendship [[treaties]]. In [[1752]],
Grand Chief Cope of the Mi'kmaq and His Excellency Peregrine Thomas
Hopson, on behalf of the [[British]] Sovereign, agreed to articles of peace and</p>
<p>friendship outlined in the Mi'kmaq Compact. The Compact or [[Treaty]]</p>
<p>stipulated "the said [[Indian]]s shall have all favour, Friendship &amp; Protection
shewn them from this His Majesty's Government" and in exchange the
Mi'kmaq agreed to protect his Majesty's subjects from harm and "use their
utmost Endeavours to bring in the other [[Indian]]s to Renew and Ratify this</p>
<p>Peace" (as cited in Cummings &amp; Mickenberg, [[1970]], p. 307). Henderson,
Benson, and Findlay ([[2000]]) stated the "Mi'kmaq Compact created</p>
<p>boundaries for communities that respected their autonomous political and
legal systems. The compact constituted an integrated legal order based on
mutual obligations recognizing sharing, autonomy, and freedom of
association" (p. 137).
The early [[treaties]] and specifically the [[1763]] Royal Proclamation formed
the basis of [[Britain]]'s treating with First Nations1, and although the [[British]]

<p>[[North]] [[America]] Act united the [[British]] colonies as the Dominion of [[Canada]]</p>
<p>in [[1867]], the [[treaties]] continued to be recognized in Imperial law. In [[1982]],
[[Canada]]'s Constitution Act ensured "The existing [[aboriginal]] and [[treaty]]</p>
<p>rights of the [[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]] are hereby recognized and
affirmed" (as cited in Isaac, [[1995]], p. 310). Thus when [[Canada]], with the aid
of a loan from the [[British]] [[government]], purchased the Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company's territory in [[1869]], the Imperial [[Crown]] required [[Canada]] to
ensure that
the claims of the [[Indian]] tribes to compensation for lands required for purposes of
settlement will be considered and settled in conformity with the equitable principles
which have uniformly governed the [[British]] [[Crown]] in its dealings with the aborigines.
(Rupert's Land Order-in-Council, as cited in Cumming &amp; Mickenberg, [[1970]], p. 148)</p>
<p>Between [[1870]] and [[1877]], [[Canada]], on behalf of the Imperial [[Crown]], met
and negotiated Treaties 1 to 7 with First Nations from western [[Ontario]] to</p>
<p>the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Both [[Canada]] and First Nations
entered into negotiations with specific goals. The [[treaty]] commissioners
wanted to negotiate the transfer of land ownership to facilitate the
construction of the railroad and the settlement of [[Europe]]an and [[Canadian]]
farmers and entrepreneurs in exchange for specific services (Morris, [[1991]] /
[[1880]], p. 194). First Nations [[representative]]s, particularly during the [[Treaty]]
4 to 7 negotiations, wished to negotiate the peaceful sharing of their land
in exchange for services that would enable them not only to survive the
loss of their traditional lifestyle but also to participate fully in the new
economy ([[Treaty]] 7 Elders &amp; Tribal Council, [[1996]], p. xi).
I argue in this article that the First Nation [[representative]]s who negotiated
the numbered [[treaties]] had an understanding of formal education and
expected their members and future generations to benefit from such
services. Formal education would enable First Nation communities to
supplement traditional educational practices with western teaching so they</p>
<p>could "live and prosper and provide" (Morris, [[1991]]/[[1880]], p. 28). The
[[Crown]], however, did not fulfil its constitutional obligations and, from the</p>
<p>outset, chose to provide limited educational services not as a [[treaty]] right,
but as an assimilationist mechanism through its own criteria, the [[Indian]]
Act.</p>
<p>METHOD</p>

<p>an historical setting and "begins from the point of view that inquir

<p>A TREATY RIGHT TO EDUCATION</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>documentation relating to the provision of education within the context</p>
<p>of the negotiations and signing of [[Treaty]] 7. [[Treaty]] 7 Elders were
interviewed and while their comments are specific to [[Treaty]] 7, these
comments have general applicability to the numbered [[treaties]]. I have
centred my [[research]] on the rule of law, constitutional supremacy, and the
legal precedents relating to [[treaty]] rights that are applicable to the [[treaty]]
right to education.
TREATY PARTNERS</p>
<p>Two distinct societies, each with its own language and culture, met a
negotiated [[treaties]], each believing that the other had fully understoo</p>
<p>the intent and purpose of the negotiations ([[Treaty]] 7 Elders &amp; Tr
Council, [[1996]], pp. 126-127). The [[treaties]] would, however, be as much</p>
<p>symbol of misunderstanding as of mutual agreement. Over the n</p>
<p>century the two signatories debated the spirit and intent of the treat</p>
<p>and found little consensus in their understanding of the [[treaty]] negotiation</p>
<p>and specifically what the [[treaty]] right to education entailed. The issu
caused frequent dissension and at times conflict. The disparity solidi
as First Nations continued to maintain their right to education stemm
from reference in the numbered [[treaties]], while the [[Crown]] chose to m
no reference to its [[treaty]] commitment and instead, relied upon the Ind
Act, its own legislation, to provide educational services, which were of
subservient to the [[Crown]]'s financial priorities and national issues.
The [[Indian]] Act, which came into force in [[1876]], consolidated previo</p>
<p>colonial legislation and "impose[d] Euro-[[Canadian]] social organizati</p>
<p>and cultural values, [or] English common law" on First Nations (Carte</p>
<p>[[1999]], p. 116). Subsequent amendments to the [[Indian]] Act formaliz
educational practices of the dominant society in order to "civilize
protect and cherish this helpless Race" (Dickason, [[1996]], p. 225). In thi
way, [[Canada]] established its own policy parameters and resource le</p>
<p>relating to the provision of educational services for First Nations.
Circumventing the [[treaties]] and its constitutional responsibility, Can
defined educational services in the [[Indian]] Act Section 114 to 122. Section</p>
<p>114 (1) states:
114. (1) The [[Governor]] in Council may authorize the Minister, in accordance with this
Act, to enter into agreements on behalf of Her Majesty for the education in
accordance with this Act of [[Indian]] [[child]]ren with</p>
<p>(a) the [[government]] of a province,
(b) the Commissioner of the [[North]]west [[Territories]],
(c) the Commissioner of the [[Yukon]] Territory,</p>

<p>"Her Majesty agrees to maintain a school on each reserve hereb</p>
<p>whenever the [[Indian]]s of the reserve should desire it" (Morris, [[1991]] /</p>
<p>p. 315). From the outset, Treaties 1 and 2 established both the [[treaty]]</p>
<p>to and policy context for the provision of educational services wh
Nations requested them. As well, the [[treaties]] established the C
fiduciary obligation for First Nation education. The [[treaties]] gave the
Nations responsibility for the implementation and control of ed
and when and where educational services were to be provided. T
([[1873]]), and subsequently [[Treaty]] 5 ([[1875]]) and [[Treaty]] 6 ([[1876]]), stat

<p>[[1991]] / [[1880]], p. 323). Although Treaties 3, 5, and 6 included the word</p>
<p>and instruction, the written [[treaty]] documents decreased the C
commitment to First Nations education because education was to be</p>
<p>provided only when "[[Canada]] may seem advisable," not as the earlier</p>

<p>A TREATY RIGHT TO EDUCATION</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>A</p>
<p>believed that education would enable First Nations to "live in comfort..</p>
<p>. [so] you can live and prosper and provide" (Morris, [[1991]] /[[1880]], p. 28).
In order to do so, the Chief of Lac Seul requested a "school-master to be
sent them to teach their [[child]]ren" (Morris, [[1991]] / [[1880]], p. 49).</p>
<p>The oral and written accounts of the [[treaty]] negotiations add to an
understanding of the [[Crown]]'s fiduciary responsibility to provide
educational services. At the [[North]] West Angle [[treaty]] meeting, Archibald's
successor, Alexander Morris, told the people gathered for the signing of
[[Treaty]] 3, "I will also establish schools whenever any band asks for them,
so that your [[child]]ren may have the learning of the [[white]] man" (Morris,</p>
<p>[[1991]]/[[1880]], p. 58). Clarifying his statement, Morris added, "Whenever
you go to a Reserve, the [[Queen]] will be ready to give you a school and
schoolmaster" (p. 93). At the [[Treaty]] 6 negotiations, Morris stated, "[Yjour
[[child]]ren will be taught, and then they will be as well able to take care of
themselves as the [[white]]s around them" (p. 213). At this same meeting,
the [[Cree]]s showed the in[[flu]]ence of the Christian missionaries by listing
among their demands "a school teacher of whatever denomination we</p>

further context for the education clause, one Elder in my study stated,
"The missionaries taught everyone [[[adults]] and [[child]]ren]; that is what
our People understood formal education to be" ( p. 233). The [[Crown]]'s
commitment to provide formal education (schools and instruction) built
upon community educational practices of life-long education and added
western formal instruction to traditional educational practices.
Our ancestors taught their [[child]]ren how to hunt, snare... [which] were our traditional</p>
<p>means of survival. Our [means of] survival were taken away from us and the
[[government]] promised us education for future success. The [[government]] is obliged to

<p>CANADIAN GOVERNMENT INDIAN POLICY</p>
<p>David Laird, who replaced Morris as [[treaty]] commissioner, travelle
[[September]], [[1877]], to Blackfoot Crossing for the [[Treaty]] 7 negotiat
Previously, minister of the interior from [[1873]] to [[1876]], he had been
involved in [[Canadian]] [[Indian]] policy. He championed the [[Indian]] Act t
Parliament, legislation that created a uniform approach "in contr
management of the reserves, lands, moneys and [[property]] of Indi
[[Canada]]" ([[Indian]] Act, [[1876]], sec. 2, as cited in De Brou &amp; Waiser, 19</p>
<p>96). The act negotiated after the signing of Treaties 1 to 5 made no refe</p>
<p>to [[treaty]] commitments nor did it refer to schools or education, oth
in relation to the authority of Chief and Councils to establish rul
regulations for "the construction and repair of school houses" (India
[[1876]], sec. 63 [6], as cited in De Brou &amp; Waiser, [[1992]], p. 99). Was this
an oversight or intentional omission in the legislation by the Imp
[[government]]? Was the reference in the [[Indian]] Act to the Chief and Cou
authority to determine where and when to construct schools a reco
of First Nations' control and involvement in formal education?</p>
<p>The written [[treaties]] clearly stipulated the Imperial [[government]]'s
responsibility to construct schools on each reserve when First Nations
requested it; however, when the Broken Head River First Nation, a member
of [[Treaty]] 1, requested a school, Laird's response indicated the [[government]]'s
intent to minimize its commitment to the [[treaty]] provisions and clarified
the [[government]]'s policy regarding school construction: "[T]he Government
is not bound under the [[Treaty]] to erect a schoolhouse on each Reserve, and
that the Government consider their obligation in this respect discharged
by the payment of a school teacher on each Reserve" (Provincial Archives
of [[Manitoba]], MG.12.B2, box 2/4.934). Laird's written statement contradicts
the [[Crown]]'s commitment in Treaties 1 to 5 to construct schools on each
reserve. As minister of the interior, Laird spoke on behalf of the [[government]]</p>
<p>of [[Canada]] when he responded to the Broken Head River First Nation. His
response indicated the [[government]]'s policy decision to evade its obligation
to implement the [[Treaty]] commitment to school construction.</p>
<p>Laird was subsequently appointed governor of the [[North]]-West
[[Territories]] and the [[Crown]]'s chief negotiator for [[Treaty]] 7. The wording
relating to education in [[Treaty]] 7 is very similar to that in his letter of
[[February]] 19, [[1875]]. [[Treaty]] 7 states, "Her Majesty agrees to pay the salary of
such teachers to instruct the [[child]]ren of said [[Indian]]s as to her Government</p>
<p>of [[Canada]] may seem advisable" (Morris, [[1991]]/[[1880]], p. 371). The [[Treaty]] 7
education clause makes no reference to school construction, only of the</p>

NUMBERED TREATIES IN ABEYANCE</p>
<p>As the 19th century drew to a close, the solemn [[treaty]] promises fad</p>
<p>from the [[government]]'s agenda. With its emerging statehood, 19th centu</p>
<p>liberalism, and the belief in both the individual and in progress, Can
did not appreciate "the essential nature of the differences between
own society and outlook" (Carr, [[1961]], pp. 53-54) and prairie First Nat

A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO EDUCATION</p>
<p>The [[1867]] Constitution Act, section 91 (24), vested all legislative aut
for [[Indian]]s and [[Indian]] lands in the federal [[government]]. As a resul
Nations education was defined as a federal responsibility and sep
from provincial responsibility for education (sec. 93). By the lat
century, law in [[Britain]] and [[Canada]] recognized the right of all chil
education within the context of English common law tradition: the
"obligation to individuals to educate [[child]]ren" was entrenched (Foley,</p>
<p>p.1). The right of all non-[[Aboriginal]] [[child]]ren to education was s
applicable to First Nations [[child]]ren as a part of their [[treaty]] and
constitutional rights and [[Canada]] was required to act in the [[child]]ren's best
interest. Although the Constitution identified the federal responsibility
for First Nations education, separate from provincial educational
responsibility, First Nations educational services arguably ought to be</p>

<p>133</p>
<p>services and educational resources - staff, schools, and material resources</p>
<ul>
<li>equitable with those provided by provincial educational systems. First
Nations students were denied the educational programming and
opportunities which facilitated similar achievement levels as their non[[Aboriginal]] peers. The separate educational system and lack of educational
attainment was identified in a study of the [[1921]] [[Canada]] Census: "The
[[Indian]]s are only very slightly connected with the education efforts of the
different provinces, the responsibility for their education lying with the
Dominion and private denominational institutions (Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, [[1926]], p. 38). Furthermore, the study stated the inclusion of literacy</li>
</ul>
<p>statistics for the First Nations population in [[Canadian]] statistics as a whole</p>
<p>was "most misleading" (p. 38), particularly when [[Canada]]'s educational
attainments were compared to other countries. Little changed over the
decades. McMurtry ([[1985]]) in a study of the [[1946]]-[[1948]] Joint Committee of
the Senate and House of Commons on the [[Indian]] Acts summarized the</p>
<p>general tone of the submissions on the state of First Nations schools:
Notoriously underfunded, poorly equipped and constructed, [and teachers were] paid</p>
<p>less than their colleagues in neighbouring public schools. The residential schools attracted
great criticism because of the half-day labor system [which] obliged the [[child]]ren to work</p>
<p>in the fields, sew, clean, etc. for several hours each day, thereby greatly restricting classroom</p>
<p>time. (McMurtry, [[1985]], p. 61)</p>
<p>The failure of the federal [[government]] to fulfil its constitutional and [[treaty]]</p>
<p>responsibility for First Nations education was raised in the House of
Commons:</p>
<p>While there are 130,000 [[Indian]]s in the country, our education and training of these peop
take care of only about 16,000. Of this number enrolled, only 883 reach grade 7,324 rea
grade 8, and seventy-one reach grade 9. I notice in three of the provinces there are n</p>
<p>grade 9 students. (House of Commons Debates, [[1946]], p. 5489)</p>
<p>Two decades later, the gloomy picture of educational services and leve
were relatively unchanged. The demand for change was to erupt from
First Nations in part as a reaction to federal Liberal policy. In [[1969]], th
Liberal [[government]], in search of a "just society," introduced a policy pap</p>

<p>the [[1960]]-[[1961]] Parliamentary Joint Committee on [[Indian]] Affairs an
reminded his audience of the [[Crown]]'s [[treaty]] commitments: "Many mo
ago your forefathers and mine took each other by the hand and ente
into a [[treaty]]" (Joint Committee, [[1960]], p. 970). It was two decades lat
however, as a consequence of court rulings, before [[Canada]] paid heed
the [[treaties]]. It was ultimately the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] that brou</p>
<p>to the forefront the [[treaty]] agreements. Although the Court decisions hav
for the most part, dealt with the [[treaty]] right to hunt and fish, the cour
have looked at the totality of the event of [[treaty]]-making, not simply</p>
<p>specific words, and in so doing have established a more complete
understanding of the [[treaty]]-making process. Isaac ([[1995]]) wrote, "In
addition to actual terms of a [[treaty]], the minutes of meetings at which
negotiations took place and events leading up to the signing of a [[treaty]]
have been interpreted to convey rights" (p. 236). To support his argument,
Isaac used the example of R. v. Taylor, [[1981]], in which the [[Ontario]] Court of</p>
<p>Appeal found that
[A]lthough the written terms of an [[1818]] [[treaty]] did not contain a guarantee of hunting and
fishing rights, the minutes of the council meeting between the Deputy Superintendent of
[[Indian]] Affairs and the chiefs of the six tribes who were parties to the [[treaty]] reveal that</p>
<p>hunting and fishing rights on [[Crown]] lands in areas covered by the [[treaty]] were retained
by the tribes. (p. 236)</p>
<p>The Sioui ruling by the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] in [[1990]] also looked at
the totality of [[treaty]]-making. In making its judgement, the Supreme Court
referenced General Murray's [[1760]] letter to the [[Huron]]s in which the [[Crown]]'s</p>
<p>[[representative]] assured them of the "free Exercise of their Religion, [and]
their Customs" (as cited in Isaac, p. 130). The Sioui decision upheld the
rights of the [[Huron]] descendants to practise their religion and customs in
their traditional locale because the intention of Murray's letter was to create
mutually binding obligations of primary importance. The Supreme Court's</p>

<p>In [[1982]], the [[Canadian]] Constitution was repatriated and amended. The

<p>Although the Constitution Act did not define [[treaty]] rights, the
recognition of [[treaty]] rights solidified the [[government]]'s fiduciary
relationship with First Nations dating back to the Mi'kmaq [[treaties]] and
the Royal Proclamation of [[1763]] and subsequent special relationships,
whether historical, political, legal, or socioeconomic which developed
between the [[Crown]] and First Nations people (Isaac, [[1995]], p. 167). The
Constitution Act gave "explicit protection for existing [[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]]</p>
<p>rights" (Henderson et al., [[2000]], p. 337). Furthermore, Henderson et al.
argued that
The "promise" of section 35, as it was termed in R. v. Sparrow, recognized not only the
ancient occupation of land by [[Aboriginal]] peoples, but also their contribution to the building</p>
<p>of [[Canada]], and the special commitments made to them by successive [[government]]s. The
protection of these rights reflects an important underlying constitutional value. (p. 337)</p>
<p>In [[1982]] Slattery (as cited in Isaac, [[1995]]), wrote, "the [[Crown]] has a general
fiduciary duty toward native people to protect them in the enjoyment of
their [[aboriginal]] rights" (pp. 167-168). The courts in R. v. Guerin brought
the fiduciary responsibility of [[Canada]] in [[Aboriginal]] matters to the forefront.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of [[Canada]] held that "the federal [[Crown]] must act in
the best interests of [[Indian]] peoples when dealing with [[Indian]] [[property]]
and lands" (Isaac, [[1995]], p. 167). Five years later, R. v. Sparrow further
defined the [[Crown]]'s fiduciary responsibility. In his decision Judge Dickson
wrote:</p>
<p>The Government has the responsibility to act in a fiduciary capacity with the respect to</p>
<p>[[aboriginal]] peoples. The relationship between the Government and [[aboriginal]]s is trustlike, rather than adversarial, and contemporary recognition and affirmation of [[aboriginal]]
rights must be defined in light of this historic relationship. (as cited in Isaac, [[1995]], p. 169)</p>
<p>In [[December]], [[1997]], the Supreme Court of [[Canada]] rendered one of the
most important legal decisions of the century in its ruling on the Gitksan</p>
<p>and Wet'suwet'en [[Aboriginal]] title in the Delgamuukw decision. The ruling
dealt with the issue of land title; however, various points of the Chief
Justice's statements are applicable in relation to education as a [[treaty]] right.</p>
<p>The Delgamuukw decision stated:
The [[Crown]] is under a moral, if not a legal duty, to enter into and conduct... negotiations
in good faith. Ultimately, it is through negotiated settlements, with good faith and give
and take on all sides, reinforced by the judgements of this Court that we will achieve ...
a basic purpose of s. 35 (1) - "the reconciliation of the pre-existence of [[aboriginal]] societies
with the [[sovereignty]] of the [[Crown]]." (as cited in Pape &amp; Salter, 1[[998]], p. 8)</p>

decision noted:
Notwithstanding the challenges created by the use of oral [[history]] as proof of historical
fact, the laws of evidence must be adapted in order that this type of evidence can be
accommodated and placed on an equal footing with the types of historical evidence that
courts are familiar with, which largely consists of documentary evidence. (Pape &amp; Salter,
1[[998]], p. 3)</p>
<p>The Supreme Court decision placed the oral [[history]] of First Nations
people parallel to the written word. The use of oral [[history]] was also upheld</p>
<p>in the [[1999]] Supreme Court's decision in R. v. Marshall. By acquitting
[[Donald]] Marshall Jr. of charges relating to fishing eels, the Court supported
the [[treaty]] right to hunt, fish, and gather as negotiated by the Mi'kmaq and
the [[Crown]] in [[1752]]. The Court stated it "would allow this appeal [acquittal]
because nothing less would uphold the honour and integrity of the [[Crown]]</p>
<p>in its dealings with the Mi'kmaq people to secure their peace and
friendship" ([[Aboriginal]] Rights Coalition of [[British]] Columbia, [[2002]], p. 1).
The oral [[history]] of the people of the numbered [[treaties]] regarding what</p>
<p>was said and negotiated at the [[treaty]] meetings gained legal force as a
result of the Badger and Delgamuukw decisions, while the Marshall
decision reinforced the [[Crown]]'s responsibility to ensure that negotiated
[[treaty]] rights are upheld and dealt with consistently, "even if it meant
disregarding federal regulations" ([[Aboriginal]] Rights Coalition of [[British]]
Columbia, [[2002]], p. 1).

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TREATY RIGHT TO EDUCATION</p>
<p>For First Nations, the [[treaties]] embody their solemn agreement and
relationship with the [[Crown]]. During [[Canada]]'s century of avoidance of
the [[treaties]], First Nations people kept the [[treaties]] alive and continued to
press, from time to time, for the fulfilment of the [[treaty]] promises,
particularly the [[treaty]] right to education. The chiefs and headmen who</p>
<p>signed the numbered [[treaties]] negotiated an educational right
complementary to their own [[Aboriginal]] teachings. Aware of the
instructional practices of the newcomers, they sought to supplement their
community educational practices with the linguistic and literacy s[[kill]]s of
the settlers. They were, however, dragged into an abyss and forced into
an educational system that sought to eliminate their traditional educational
practices, languages, culture, and customs, something that had not been a
part of the [[treaty]] negotiations.
[[Canada]] failed to implement the [[treaty]] commitment to education. The
[[government]] left the establishment of day schools to the initiatives of various</p>
<p>religious organizations. [[Canada]]'s policy was to fund schools only after
they were constructed, usually by First Nations and missionary groups,
with the building materials acquired from the natural resources on the
reserves. In the late [[1880]]s, [[Canada]] provided limited financial assistance
to religious entities towards the establishment of Industrial schools and
later Residential schools. These buildings, however, were usually located
on isolated areas of the reserve or off-reserve. Such schools not only denied</p>
<p>First Nations input into the schools but ignored the [[treaty]] commitment
that schools would be constructed on reserve whenever First Nations
desired.</p>

<p>[[parliament]]ary committees during the 20th century and specifically
[[1996]] Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples (RCAP) documented, t
level and type of education provided for First Nations students ove</p>
<p>past century failed to provide equitable educational opportunitie</p>
<p>consequently failed to [[foster]] economic prospects for First Nations p
(Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples, [[1996]]a, p. 38).
In [[1894]], amendments to clause 11 of the [[Indian]] Act empowered t
governor-general-in-council to make regulations to enforce the atten
of [[Indian]] [[child]]ren at school; however, the [[government]] did not offic
incorporate the compulsory school attendance clause into the [[Indian]]</p>
<p>until [[1920]]. Despite the [[government]]'s own legislation requiring compu
attendance of all [[Indian]] [[child]]ren at school, it is clear from the minut</p>
<p>[[parliament]]ary commissions (McMurtry, [[1985]]) that, as late as [[1960]], sc
facilities did not exist on numerous reserves across [[Canada]]. Schools th</p>
<p>did exist were often considered inferior to non-[[aboriginal]] sch</p>
<p>programming lacked financial resources; and, similarly, teachers' sala
were below provincial levels (McMurtry, [[1985]]).
The [[1970]]s marked a resurgence of the involvement of First Natio
people across [[Canada]] in the education of their [[child]]ren. First Nation</p>
<p>demanded appropriate quality educational services and "Aborig</p>
<p>peoples... explicitly question[ed] the existing educational system" (A
Dittbumer &amp; Graham, [[2000]], p. 6). Although the [[Canadian]] govern
accepted in principle [[Indian]] Control of [[Indian]] Education ([[1972]]), it did
change its mode of administering education under the [[Indian]] Act. T
promise of a [[treaty]] right to education, the opportunity not only to
quality formal education but also at the same time to maintain their
linguistic and cultural identity, remained elusive, as did the opportu
for many First Nations people to participate meaningfully in the Can
economy.</p>
<p>In the later part of the 20th century, [[treaty]] First Nations began to assume</p>
<p>administrative control of educational services and schools on reserve;
however, in receiving funding from the department of [[Indian]] Affairs, they</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>Reflecting recent rulings of the Supreme Court of [[Canada]], t
Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples recommended the recogn
education as a [[treaty]] right. Furthermore, the Royal Commission</p>
<p>First Nations "want two things from education ... the s[[kill]]s they
participate fully in the economy. . . [along] with the knowledge o
languages and traditions necessary for cultural continuity" (RCAP
p. 82), a goal similar to that the chiefs and headmen believed th
negotiated as a [[treaty]] right to education. To rebalance the politi</p>
<p>economic power between [[aboriginal]] nations and other [[Canadian]]
[[government]]s, RCAP recommended educational reforms must be
implemented immediately to remedy the gap between current educational
attainment and community needs (RCAP, [[1996]]a, p. 82). Education must
reflect the structure, practices, and vision of First Nations communities.
Education is a [[treaty]] and constitutional right to be treasured and a process</p>
<p>that enables First Nations to blend traditional purposes of education,
language, and culture with the s[[kill]]s necessary for collaboration in today's
global society.
The issue of the demand for the recognition of education as a [[treaty]]
right will not dissipate until profound educational changes occur: including
appropriate funding and effective control beyond merely administrative</p>
<p>responsibility for a poorly funded and externally directed education
services. First Nations education must reflect the language, traditions, and
culture of their communities and receive the resources necessary to ensure
quality educational programming, and to ensure educational attainment
and [[foster]] the "crucial s[[kill]]s for governance and economic self-reliance"
(RCAP, [[1996]]b, vol. 5, p.3). Only profound change, financial commitment,</p>
<p>and local control of education can eradicate a century of educational
neglect. It is time to honour the [[treaty]] commitment to education.
NOTES</p>
<p>1 Although the term [[Indian]] was used at the time the [[treaties]] were being negotiated,
I use the term First Nations interchangeably for purpose of this paper.</p>
