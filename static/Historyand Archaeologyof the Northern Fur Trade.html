<p>In their efforts to reconstruct regional culture histories, archaeologists, ethnohistorians,
and historical geographers commonly employ a tripartite chronological scheme that</p>
<p>includes prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic periods as the basic frames of referenc</p>
<p>The protohistoric is regarded as the transitional period between the initial receipt of
European goods by the aboriginal inhabitants of a region which signals the end of the
prehistoric, and the arrival of Europeans in the area which marks the beginning of the
historic period. The general assumption appears to be that the protohistoric was a time of
comparatively slight change in material culture and that the extensive replacement of
traditional wares with those of European manufacture did not begin until trading posts
were established locally.</p>
<p>Operating on this assumption, archaeologists have used the relative yields of European
artifacts to determine whether a site is early or late protohistoric when C-14 dating cannot
be used, and, when European wares are not datable precisely. If the latter can be dated
and there are relatively few such items present at a site, the low yield is generally regarded
as evidence that little change had taken place prior to the established date. This paper will
examine these assumptions from the perspective of fur trade history. In particular,
consideration will be given to the implications that the spatial structure of the fur trade,
and the economic behavior of the Indians, could have for the yields of European artifacts
in early post contact sites in the central and western Subarctic and northern Plains.
THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE FUR TRADE</p>
<p>After a relatively short period of adjustment following initial European contact, Indian
groups began to assume rather specialized roles in the fur trade, serving primarily as</p>
<p>provisioners, traders, or trappers (Heidenreich 1971:219-51; Heindenreich and Ray 1976;</p>
<p>Innis 1964:20ff; Ray 1974:51-61). Consequently, the fur trading system developed a
distinctive spatial structure and each trading post or point of contact was ringed with local,
middleman, and indirect trade areas (Fig. 1). In the local trade areas the roles of hunter,
trapper, and trader were not sharply differentiated and most Indian men served in all three
capacities. However, because this zone was the closest to the post, it was quickly
over-trapped and many Indians focused their activities on hunting game and fowl for the</p>
<p>local provision market the Europeans provided. Since the post was nearby, Indians living</p>
<p>in this zone could visit it more than once a year and they became very dependent upon
Europeans for material items.</p>
<p>At a greater distance from the centers of trade, the distribution of European goods and
the supply of furs for the post was largely in the hands of Indian trade specialists, or
middlemen. Indeed, Andrew Graham, one of the leading traders for the Hudson's Bay
Company in the late 18th century, reported that less than ten percent of the Indians
coming to York Factory and Fort Churchill acquired their furs through trapping activities.

<p>Rather, they obtained them mostly by tra
1969:261). Generally, the area occupied by the middlemen was the region from which
Indian trading parties could safely make one trip a year to the European posts.
Beyond the middleman area lay the indirect trade region. For Indians living in this
region, distance precluded any extensive trade because of the time required in transit and
the shortness of the transportation season. Also, middlemen discouraged any direct
contact by applying force to prevent it when necessary (Ray 1974:59-60). Thus, relatively
few Indians ever visited the trading post from this zone.
Although a pattern of trade similar to that outlined above no doubt existed during the
early phases of European-Indian contact in many areas of North America, it has particular
significance for the central and western subarctic because the key European group, the
English, chose not to move inland for over a century after initially establishing themselves
on the shores of Hudson and James Bays. Rather, as the critics of the Hudson's Bay
Company charged, the company was content to "sleep by the frozen sea" and let the
Indian middlemen bring the furs to the bay.
Figure 2 shows the pattern of trade that had emerged in the central and western
subarctic by 1700. The local trade area of the English on James Bay and the French at
York Factory (which they renamed Fort Bourbon during their occupation of the post
between 1694 and 1714), was centered on the Hudson Bay lowlands, which were largely
occupied by the Cree groups who came to be known as the "Home Guard" or Swampy
Cree. Journal and account book records of the Hudson's Bay Company indicate that these
groups accounted for less than twenty percent of the total canoe traffic of the posts on the
bay (Ray 1974:61-62; Journals of Fort Churchill [established 1717] PAC HBC B
42/a/1-40). In the interior, the French continued to expand their St. Lawrence-based fur
trade and had established small posts as far to the north and west as Lake Nipigon and
Rainy Lake by the late 1680's (Ray, 1974:11). Nonetheless, most of the trade of the
northern Ontario area that was funneled eastward was controlled by Cree and Ojibwa
groups who occupied the northern and eastern shores of Lake Superior when the French
trade expanded into the region following the fall of Huronia in 1649 (Heidenreich
1971: Map 24: Bishop 1974:308-11, 332). Thus, northern Ontario was effectively part of the</p>
<p>indirect trade area of the St. Lawrence-based French trade, and, also, was included in the</p>
<p>middleman zone of the Hudson Bay-oriented trading network (Fig. 2).
The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht brought French-English rivalries in Hudson Bay to an end
leaving the Hudson's Bay Company in control of all of the posts on the bay. From 1713
until 1774 the company adhered to its earlier policy of limiting its establishment of trading</p>
<p>posts to the shores of Hudson Bay, and consequently, the bay-oriented trading system had</p>
<p>changed very little by the middle of the eighteenth century (Fig. 3). However, being
excluded from the bay, the French redoubled their efforts in the interior and attempted to
cut the English company off from its hinterland. In the 1720s French posts were
re-established along the north shores of Lake Superior; by 1734 establishments had been
constructed in the vicinity of Lake Winnipeg and by the early 1750s French trading houses
had been built on the Saskatchewan River (Fig. 3).
Significantly, all of the major inland posts of the French skirted the shield country,
which was not a primary fur area, and instead, they were located in the intertribal trade
section of the middleman zone of the Hudson's Bay Company trading network. This
territory was clearly the key to the system. The majority of the canoes that arrived at York</p>
<p>Factory and Fort Churchill came from this region (zone IL-b of Fig. 3) (Ray 1974:62; PAC</p>
<p>HBC B 42/a/1-40). Yet, by locating their posts in this vital sector, the French did not
bypass the Assiniboine and Cree middlemen. Rather, they allowed the latter groups to
collect their furs from their traditional trading partners (e.g., Mandan, Blood, Blackfoot,</p>
<p>Gros Ventre, and Athabascan speaking groups) and intercepted them as they carried the</p>
<p>furs to the English. Because of severe logistical constraints, the French were able only to
skim off the best furs the middlemen carried, and in return, could supply them with a</p>
<p>limited range of European goods, mostly items of relatively low bulk and high value (Ray</p>

<p>1978</p>
<p>1974:72-93). Therefore, the Hudson's Bay Company continued to dominate the fur and</p>
<p>hide trade and supplied the Indians of the central and western subartic with the greatest</p>
<p>part of their stocks of arms and munitions, metal goods, cloth and other key items.
THE INDIAN MIDDLEMEN</p>
<p>It is clear from the above that Indian middlemen played a central role in the fur trade of
southern Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta from the late 17th to the late 18th
centuries. These middlemen traders differed from their European counterparts in terms of
their economic behavior. For example, unlike European merchants who purchased stocks
of goods specifically for purposes of trade, the Indian middleman who arrived at the
Hudson's Bay Company posts bought goods largely to satisfy his own demand. According
to Andrew Graham, a typical Indian shopping list would be like the one shown in Table 1.
Graham further relates that the consumer demand of the Indians was relatively fixed on a
short term basis and efforts to increase consumption of European goods to stimulate a</p>
<p>greater flow of furs in return largely failed (Williams 1969:263-64). Any furs in excess of
the 70 that were required to meet basic needs were usually spent on items that could be</p>
<p>consumed at the post, such as alcohol, rather than on additional utilitarian goods that
could be taken into the interior.
Since the middlemen refused to take any more goods than they could use themselves,
even though the company traders encouraged them to do so (Williams 1969:263), it follows
that most of the goods that the middlemen groups would have passed on to other inland
trapping bands would have been used. The majority of the articles that changed hands in
this "second-hand trade' would have been at least a year old given the fact that the
middlemen obtained them at the trading posts in June, July, and August, but usually did
not barter them away to other Indian groups until the following spring, normally between
March and early May (Ray 1974:89-91). Nonetheless, when trafficking in this used
merchandise, the Assiniboine and Cree middlemen exacted large price increases. This is
clear from Table 2, which shows the prices that Andrew Graham said the Cree charged the
Blackfoot in 1766 in comparison with those he claimed that the Hudson's Bay Company
demanded from the Cree.
The official prices that Graham cited as his basis for comparison do not give an entirely</p>
<p>accurate picture since the traders at the post charged more than the official rates. An

<p>analysis of the account books for York Factory, the post to which Graham was referring,
reveals that the unofficial, or de facto, rates were averaging about fifty percent higher
than the official prices. Thus, even making allowances for the differences between the two
pricing schedules in use by the Hudson's Bay Company, it is clear that the Indian
middlemen were charging considerably more for European goods than they themselves
were paying for them.</p>
<p>In spite of these large markups that were being charged for what the Hudson's Bay
Company traders termed "half wore" goods, the Assiniboine and Cree were able to
dispose of their entire stock of trade goods each spring. For example, Anthony Henday
witnessed the annual trade between the Assiniboine, Cree, and Blackfoot in the Red Deer
River area of Southern Alberta during the spring of 1755. After this trade was concluded
and the Assiniboine and Cree set out for York Factory in their canoes, Henday remarked:
"We are above 60 Canoes and there are scarce a Gun, Kettle, Hatchet or Knife amongst</p>
<p>us, having traded them with the Archithinue [Blackfoot]" (Burpee 1907:351). Hendays</p>
<p>comment is of considerable significance because it suggests that even though the
Assiniboine and Cree were exacting huge markups, they were still trading largely for
replacement, not to amass big surplus stocks of European goods. By the time the trading
parties set out for the European posts, they were virtually destitute of trade goods.
This posed problems for these middlemen during the period the French held control of
York Factory and during the early years of the Hudson's Bay Company re-occupation of
the post (1714-1716). Supplies were unreliable at this time due to the late arrival of ships
and the fact that the Europeans had not yet developed the practice of keeping a two years'
supply of goods at the post to cover such emergencies. Thus, when the Hudson's Bay
Company ship failed to arrive in the summer of 1716, some Assiniboine groups who had
arrived from the head of the Churchill River complained that they would be killed by their
own guns, which they had traded away on the expectation of obtaining new ones at the
bay. They added that this had happened on several occasions during the French
occupation and the Assiniboine claimed that they suffered heavy losses as a result.
Thereafter, the company began the practice of keeping a two-year supply of all essential
items on hand. The traders realized that unless they did so, they would lose the trade of
these middlemen (York Factory Journals 1716-17, Public Archives of Canada, Hudson's
Bay Company Collection [Microfilm] B 239/a/2-3. Thus, the trading network of the Indian
middlemen appears to have been operating in a steady state condition during the 18th
century. The flow of trade goods and furs was regulated by the relatively fixed consumer
demand of the Assiniboine and Cree middlemen. Had these middlemen been willing and
able to cater to the demands of their Indian trading partners living in the indirect trade
region, there is little doubt that the total volume of exchange would have been much
greater.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS</p>
<p>It is clear that the manner in which the fur trade operated in central and western Canada
until 1763 could have important implications for archaeological studies of post contact
sites. For instance, it is generally assumed that as Indian groups adopted European trade
goods, traditional technologies were abandoned. Thus, one would expect an inverse</p>

<p>correlation between the relative yields of aboriginal and European artifacts at post contact
sites. As the latter increase the former should decrease. Operating on this assumption, it is
common practice to regard sites with low European artifact yields as being early contact
sites, and, or, ones in which relatively little culture change had occurred as a result of
European influences.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that since the middlemen were passing on nearly all of their
durable European goods as second hand items after a year or two of use, few of them
would have been worn out and discarded locally. Rather, the majority of such trade goods
would have been broken and thrown away in the indirect trade areas. On this basis it could
be hypothesized that a regional population would first receive its European goods during
the indirect trade phase, that many of these goods would be incomparatively poor
condition resulting in a high breakage rate, and consequently, the archaeological yield of
European wares from this phase would be relatively high. Subsequent yields would be
lower during the middleman phase as the local population became involved in the trade
directly. Once trading houses were established locally, the aboriginal inhabitants could no
longer serve as middlemen. They became attached to a trading post obtaining and using
European goods locally. Since articles were no longer being passed on, they would have
been discarded locally. Thus, the archaeological yield of European artifacts would
increase substantially from sites or horizons coincident with the beginning of the direct or
local trade phase. The foregoing hypothesis has been diagrammed in Figure 4-a.
Alternatively, and more likely, is the situation outlined in Figure 4-b. In this case, it is
hypothesized that the indirect trade phase would not be evident archaeologically because</p>
<p>the high breakage rate characteristic of this phase would be cancelled out by the spatial
diffusion of the second hand European goods over a large indirect trade zone making local
concentrations less likely. In either case, it is clear that the middlemen trade phase, which
would account for most of what is traditionally regarded as the protohistoric, would be
under-represented archaeologically leading culture historians to collapse their
chronologies and underestimate the extent to which regional Indian cultures had been
transformed prior to the beginning of the historic or local trade phase. Thus, the arrival of
Europeans locally may in fact have little real significance for the rates of culture change.
Instead, their arrival on the scene, by changing the structural arrangement of the fur trade,
merely influenced the spatial disposition of trade wares the Indians had been accustomed
to using for some time.
Within this context, it is instructive to examine one of the key site reports for the
western Manitoba area, that of the Grand Rapid reservoir. In his analysis of the historic
phase of this area, Mayer-Oakes proposed dividing the historic period into the early
historic, the early 17th through 18th century; the middle historic, constituting mostly the</p>
<p>19th century; and the late historic, or 20th century. He postulated that the early historic</p>
<p>phase he identified was a time when Indians obtained goods indirectly, chiefly guns and
kettles, and indicated that the artifacts datable to this period accounted for only ten
percent of those of the historic period (Mayer-Oakes 1970:289). Mayer-Oakes concluded
that the middle historic phase was the time when the significant acculturation processes</p>
<p>between Indians and Europeans began, especially after 1830, because 70-85 percent of all
trade goods found at the site are datable to this period. On the basis of this evidence it was
concluded that the most intensive Hudson's Bay Company-Indian trade took place at this
time (Mayer-Oakes 1970:289-90). Evidence for the final historic phase was not very secure
according to Mayer-Oakes and only 5-10 percent of the total historic goods recovered
came from this phase (Mayer-Oakes 1970:290).</p>
<p>A glance at Figures 2 and 3 shows that the lower Saskatchewan River (which includes</p>
<p>the Grand Rapids Reservoir) would have been included in the middleman trade zone of the</p>
<p>Hudson's Bay Company throughout the late 17th and most of the 18th century until</p>
<p>Cumberland House was established at Cumberland Lake near the ManitobaSaskatchewan border in 1774. Prior to the latter date, between 56 and 66 percent of the
inland canoe traffic of York Factory would have probably passed through the Grand</p>

<p>Rapids region (Ray [[1974]]:62). The total quantities of [[Europe]]an goods that these canoes
would have carried through the region during the fifty year period between [[1720]] and [[1774]]
is shown in Table 3. Given the volume of goods passing through the Grand Rapids region
and the fact that local [[Indian]]s would have been involved in this traffic, it is safe to assume
that the fur [[trade]] would have had a great impact on traditional cultures long before [[1830]]
even though the archaeological data suggests otherwise. In fact, by the [[1830]]s, when the
archaeological record seems to indicate intensive [[trade]] and acculturation began, the
Grand Rapids region had become a backwater area in the fur [[trade]] due to prolonged over
exploitation of its fur and game resources. By that time extensive depopulation had taken
place, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was beginning to initiate conservation programs to
restore the economy of the area, and the [[Indian]]s who remained were already heavily</p>

CONCLUSION</p>
<p>This paper has attempted to consider the implications which the spatial structure of the
early fur [[trade]] and the economic behavior of the [[Indian]]s operating in that system has for
ethnohistorical-archaeological [[research]] in the central and western sub[[arctic]]. In particular,
it is argued that [[Indian]] [[trade]] specialists, or middlemen as they are commonly called,
dominated the [[trade]] for the first hundred years because the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company chose
not to move inland in force to meet its opposition until [[1774]]. The [[Indian]] middlemen carried
on a large volume of [[trade]] before that time, but because most of the intertribal [[trade]] in the
interior involved exchanges of used [[trade]] goods for furs, a large proportion of all of the</p>
<p>[[Europe]]an goods that entered the intertribal [[trade]] sector of the middleman zone eventually
passed through the area into the indirect [[trade]] region. Therefore, the middleman phase</p>
<p>will probably be under-represented at most sites. This appears to have been the case at the
Grand Rapids site which was selected as an example.
