<hr />
<p>Forty-eight people in [[[[Canada]]]] have [[battle]]d a rare and debilitating brain disorder.</p>
<p>It closely mimics the [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob]] disease, a fatal [[brain disorder]] that affects only 1 in 1 million people each year, [according to a [[Washington]] Post report].</p>
<p>For those who have suffered the symptoms of this new disorder, tests for #Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have come up negative, and experts can’t seem to find a cause.</p>
<p>Patients have ranged in age from 18 to 85 and have lived in the Moncton area or the [[New]] [[Brunswick]] Acadian peninsula.</p>
<p>For now, it’s being referred to as the [[Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause]]. Officials are currently looking into the [[New]] [[Brunswick]] Cluster.</p>
<p>Of the 48 people who have been identified as having symptoms of the unknown syndrome, six have died, as of Monday.</p>
<p>“The suffering is immense … because it’s beyond physical,” said neurologist Alier Marrero, who works at Moncton’s Dr. Georges-L.-[[Dumont University Hospital Center]]. “There’s also the [[neuropsychiatric]] and moral suffering of the patients that is only partially relieved by medications.”</p>
<p>Some of the symptoms patients are developing include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sleep disorders, including severe insomnia</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rapid and unexplained weight loss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[[Capgras delusion]], which makes patients believe their family members have been replaced by imposters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“The rapidity in the constellation of features is something that -- I’ve not seen this before,” said Michael Strong, the neurologist who heads the [[Canadian]] Institutes of Health [[Research]].</p>
<p>[[The [[Washington]] Post]]reports the cluster of cases was detected by the federal public [[health]] agency’s Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance system, which monitors for CJD and other prion disorders.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/[[prions]]/index.html">The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes</a> prion diseases as a “family of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. They are distinguished by long incubation periods, characteristic spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss, and a failure to induce inflammatory response.”</p>
<p>The brain of a person with a prion disease can resemble sponges with small holes.</p>
<p>The first case of this new disorder experts in the area were made aware of was in [[[[2015]]]], but Marrero could not find a diagnosis. From [[[[2018]]]] on, others presented with similar symptoms, and 11 new cases in [[[[2019]]]] would eventually be identified as part of the cluster. There were 24 more in [[[[2020]]]], at which time Marrero and Coulthart began thinking they could be dealing with something new.</p>
<p>“We say that they were resistant to diagnosis,” said Michael Coulthart, who heads the [[CJD]] surveillance system. “That’s what had to emerge as a pattern before we started talking about a cluster.”</p>
<p>It is believed the syndrome has a two-year incubation period.</p>
<p>Scientists have looked into many avenues for an explanation, including environ[[mental]] exposures, travel histories, diet, as well as blood screenings for a presence of infectious diseases known to cause neurological symptoms, auto[[immune]] disorders, metabolic deficits and cancer.</p>
<p>None of those tests have provided an answer.</p>
<p>A cerebrospinal [[flu]]id test for high levels of protein markers is what can help to diagnose CJD, but all of the patients have come up with a negative test result.</p>
<p>“These cases, for all intents and purposes by their description, should be CJD,” Strong said. “That’s what they sound like and are presenting like, and yet, the [[testing]] is negative.”</p>
<p>Two theories include that the syndrome could be tied to exposure to an environ[[mental]] toxin, or that it is being caused by an entirely new prion disorder.</p>
<p>A spokesperson with the [[Department of Health]] said the department is working to identify all potential causes for the unknown disease.</p>
<p>Coulthart said he believes that attention will help them to arrive at an answer.</p>
<p>“Fear is understandable,” Marrero said. “But we are working for hope.”</p>
