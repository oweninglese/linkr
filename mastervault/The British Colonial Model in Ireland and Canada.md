The Art of Breaking People Down: The British Colonial
Model in Ireland and Canada

Aziz Rahman , Mary Anne Clarke, and Sean Byrne

Ireland was central to Britain's first colonial expansion and its

techniques were honed in its expanded colonization around
the world, including in Canada. The common features include
control over land and resources and subjugation of Indigenous
peoples through enforced assimilation. Britain wanted Ireland
and Canada for military strategic purposes, economic profit, and
political power. Britain forced its way onto both lands through
methods that included forced relocations of Indigenous peoples
and legislating assimilation through penal laws in Ireland and

the Indian Act in Canada. Britain's "divide and rule policy,"
cultural and spiritual subjugation, and the use of planted settlers
were employed in both Ireland and Canada. The similarities in
both places are identified as are the distinctions due to geography

and timing. The role that complexities play within Indigenous

societies is identified. The common and differing forms of
resistance and resilience of the Irish and various Indigenous

nations in Canada are also identified.

Majesty's dominions, on which the sun never sets."

This article explores the nature of the model of British colonialism in
Ireland and Canada by addressing two questions: What were the key compo-

nents or principles of the British colonial model developed in Ireland? How
was it applied in Ireland to native Irish peoples and then honed and applied
to Indigenous peoples in Canada? This article considers the creation of the
British colonial model in Ireland and its application in Canada, highlighting
some of its central tenets, including Britain's divide and rule policy, control

over land, religious and cultural subjugation, use of the Penal Laws and the
Indian Act, and economic and political exploitation.
BRITISH COLONIALISM IN IRELAND

The British colonial model was designed and perfected in Ireland a
exported to Britain's other colonies.4 The conflict resulting from

colonialism on the island of Ireland is well over 900 years, since the

invasion of the island in 1179. In the 1690 Battle of the Boyne, Ire
Catholic elites were defeated and the Penal Laws were introduced t

land.5 The Penal Laws gave a privileged position to the Anglican Chu

forbade Catholics and Protestant Dissenters from owning land, ed

and raising their children as Catholics, Presbyterians, or Methodists,

ing public office. For its colonial objectives to prevent French and

expansion,6 the English monarchy found the island of Ireland stra
very important, economically, militarily, and politically.

Divide and Rule
The principle of pitting one ethnopolitical group against the other

by the British to expand its authority and power on the island of

as Protestant settlers and Catholic natives took on more adversaria

tions.7 Ireland had a unique social, economic, political, and cultura

through the Gaels (native Irish) clan based system and the Breh

system. These systems survived even though they were altered thr

Viking invasion of Ireland from the seventh to the eleventh centu

the twelfth century, Norman feudalism, followed by English colo
lowland Scottish mercenaries and plantations in Ulster in the seve

century, eroded the Gael's cultural, legal, socioeconomic, and politic
tures on the island.9

The lowland settlers sent to Ulster included various Protestant

denominations, most prevalently Scottish Presbyterians, Church of England,

and Methodists who began settling in support of the plantation economy in
the century.10 The division of religious faiths and identification continued

well after the 1603 Ulster Plantation. The British planted Ulster with lowlanders with a view to repress rebel Gaelic forces and impose English culture

and language in the region.11 The British Ulster Plantation granted land to
Scottish Calvinist settlers who displaced native Catholics from their land.12
These settlers rarely intermarried with the native Irish and they lived as seg-

regated communities for centuries.13 Ireland became a laboratory to create
the imperial model and the ethnoreligious divisive formula of conquest that

would be exported overseas.

British dominance was enforced through the Penal Laws, which
regulated the status of Roman Catholics.14 The Penal Laws comprehensively discriminated against Catholics who were prohibited from holding
government office or commissions or entering the legal profession; this
was coupled with acts that prevented them from owning land and limited
their access to education and practice of the Catholic religion.15 These laws
divided the agrarian south dominated by Irish Catholics from the industrial
north dominated by Protestant elites and working class loyal to England.16

According to J .J. Lee, "the 1692 Penal Laws secured a dominant relationship that allowed the Protestant community to force most Catholics

outside the socio-economic and political system."17 Scholars debate as to
whether the oppression was ethnically or religiously based; however, the
distinctions between the Irish and the planted Protestants had remained
quite distinct ethnically. Some English settlers intermarried with the local
Gaels and became more Irish than the Irish themselves.18
Native Inferiority

Ireland's Gaelic identities and traditions remained intact throughout the
Viking and Norman invasions. The Celtic language and Catholic Christian
religion were not treated as inferior or barbaric, yet, through the subsequent

British invasions, they were increasingly affected by Protestant hegemony
that led to segregation along language, religion, class, ethnicity, and culture;

this became endemic after 1500. 19 Irish Gaelic culture began to erode with

the abolition of the Gaelic Brehon law that had ensured the native people s
equality.20 The natives were treated as racially inferior. The 1649 warfare
by Cromwellian soldiers culminated in acts of genocide against Irish Gaels

with the liquidation of the inhabitants of Drogheda and Dundalk, with
Cromwell giving them the choice of "to hell or to Connacht."21

The colonizers stance on the ethnic cleansing in Ireland can be understood from the message of King James I to Cromwell, "Plant Ireland
with Puritans and root out the Papists and then secure it."22 When the
Ulster planters were imposed, they saw the Gaelic populace as culturally,
religiously, and socioeconomically inferior, and they developed a siege men-

tality in response. The 1641 and 1689 massacres of local Protestant settlers
were led by the native Gaels trying to resist British imperialism.23 The Ulster

plantation itself is a narrative of violence, which led to the ascendancy and

victory of the Orangemen after the 1690 Battle of the Boyne.24 Theobald
Wolf Tone further strengthened Protestant domination through the British
force of arms against the subsequent 1798 United Irishmen rebellion that he
led.

The island became more segregated and divided, which continued
through the creation of the Gaelic Athletic Association, the Irish language

revival, and the Irish Volunteers led by Eoin MacNeil in response to the
1912 emergence of the Ulster Volunteer Force to resist home rule for Ireland. With the signing of the Ulster Solemn League and Covenant, in 1912
in Belfast,25 the Protestant bourgeoisie were trying to prevent home rule and

a class alliance between working class Protestants and Catholics.
Even today, both communities contest political and cultural issues as
they live in enclaves under a sense of siege where the past and present have

become fused into one.26 The contemporary conflict between Protestant

Unionist Loyalists (PUL) and Catholic Nationalist Republicans (CNR) in
Northern Ireland inherits this colonial legacy from Britain's divide and rule

policy that sought to keep both ethnic groups separated.27 The PUL community celebrates the marching season on 12 July and 12 August while the

CNR community perceives the marches as triumphalism rather than as a
PUL expression of culture.28
While the old English and the Anglo-Irish settlers intermarried with
the natives before the onset of the 1603 Plantation of Ulster, from the
seventeenth century onward, the impact of British colonizers in Ulster on
the native Irish began to escalate.29 The British sovereigns force was felt
as its legal, economic, and political systems; Protestantism substantially
affected the development of Irish nationalism and Irish political, cultural,
and economic systems.30 British imperialism was more than having political

control on the island or extracting economic benefits; it was intended to
change Irish beliefs, traditions, and practices to conform to English values
and practices and bring the natives into line with Britain's way of thinking.31

However, there was resistance to the 1800 British-Ireland Act of Union.
Within the Irish people, Irish nationalism became fused with Catholicism
as the Irish struggled to create a unified Ireland free from England.32
Religion

The British colonial power also used its own fusion of political and religious

leadership as a tool of oppression in Ireland.33 The Gaelic tradition was
under attack with the 1 537 Protestant reformation and the arrival of new

English settlers who became engaged in religious, political, and socioeconomic developments in Ireland.34 British policy outlawed all Catholic beliefs

and practices and attempted to replace them with the Anglican Church of
Ireland.35 The Irish resisted by having outlawed priests give mass in the
fields; Catholicism was a symbol of their identity and a means of political
resistance to British policy.36

Apartheid Laws

This Irish Catholic homogenous identity collectivized the Irish and was
further strengthened in reaction to the Penal Laws, which discriminated
against the native Irish, culturally, economically, politically, and religiously.37

The English usurper to the crown, William of Orange, instituted Penal Laws

from 1695-1829 to bar Catholics from practicing their religion, owning
land, speaking the Gaelic language, bringing their children up as Catholics,
running for government offices, and voting.38 The 'Dissenting or apartheid

Penal Laws' applied equally to Catholics, Methodists, and Presbyterians
who were perceived as social outcasts by the established Anglican Church.39

Sectarianism was used to keep the poor divided on religious lines.
Control of the Land

Religion, nationalism, and land issues fused together for Catholic peasants.
Land is tied into the spiritual and economic welfare of ethnic groups and
together these three issues became the centre of their identity.40 Ireland
witnessed a struggle between landlords and tenant farmers and eventually
between Catholic and Protestant tenant farmers due to the sectarian behavior of the Protestant bourgeoisie in Ulster.41

British rule forced the Catholic peasants to replace their own subsistence farming with the potato cash crop to be sent to England, under
penalty of criminal convictions. Catholic tenant farmers relied almost solely

on the potato for subsistence. The mandatory use of the land for potatoes
depleted nutrients from the previously rich soils in Ireland, leading to potato

rot and eventual mass starvations of the Catholic poor.42 The 1845-1852
Irish potato famine was a period of disease, hunger, and emigration as over

one million people left Ireland's shore in order to survive certain death by
starvation.43

The British absentee Protestant landlords kept the Irish tenant farmers
dependent on the potato while the centralized government structures failed

to address the potato famine and the population of Ireland decreased by
half.44 Some English politicians believed the suffering was the responsibility of the colonized people themselves rather than of those who governed
them.45 Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian tenant farmers were landless,

hungry, and, needless to say, angry. In 1879, the land question became a
central political issue. The Irish Land League and the Irish Parliamentary
Party led by Charles Stuart Parnell mobilized the Irish peasant farmers to
press for land reform as rural unrest spiked in Ireland.46

Localized Nationalism

British policy sought to alter the Irish peoples nationalism, yet the Irish
people used their nationalist identity, intermingled with Catholicism, to resist the colonizer.47 The British imposed British parliamentary democracy in
Ireland with Irish M.P.s taking an oath of allegiance to the British monarch.48

During the nineteenth century, Irish nationalists refused to recognize
the Monarch, further driving a political and religious wedge between the
south and north of the island.49 The Irish democratic tradition evolved

into violent Irish Republicanism in the early twentieth century as Irish
Republicans launched an all-out war against Britain.50 Thus, the question

of nationalism, and the relationship between Catholicism and Irishness,
became salient in the nineteenth century with nonviolent and violent Irish
resistance movements.51

The British Empire profited from exploitation and cruelty in its colonies, beginning with Ireland.52 Irish dissenters against the British presence

were arrested and prosecuted during the British colonization period. Sir
Roger Casement is one such victim. During the 1916 Rising, Casement,

a diplomat and human rights activist involved in the Irish Republican
Brotherhood, was tried and executed for treason. Casements radical views

resulted from his observation of the colonial oppression of workers on
rubber plantations not only in Ireland but also in the Congo, Brazil, and

Peru.53 The leaders of the 1916 Rising were equally impacted by similar
views.54 With Ireland being the first British colony, it is evident that Britain

developed its colonizing processes there and then continued with further

developed methods in other locations. One such location is the land now

called Canada.

BRITISH COLONIALISM IN CANADA

In as early as the 1 500s, when Europeans arrived to what is now C

there were multiple Indigenous nations living on the land. Howeve

terra nullis , Britain and France fought over the land as if it were em

could become theirs; they competed over alliances with different In

nations to support their efforts at colonization.55 The Seven Ye
between the British and the French, 1754-1763, led to Britain a
French controlled Canada and installing its rule in North America
the 1763 Royal Proclamation.*
Despite the end of some aspects of formal British colonial
Canada, at the time of Confederation in 1867 through the BN
Canada remained part of the British Commonwealth as the Crown
of Canada (the Crown). Canada existed as a transplanted Britain, wi

or no inclusion of Indigenous peoples in governance. The colonial g

ment s policies remain to this day, primarily through the self-pro

1876 Indian Act . Some of the other components of the Crowns
over non-Indigenous Canada have ended; however, Indigenous pe
Canada remain colonized through the Crown.57
Canada Is a Treaty Country with Colonial Laws

With its reference to "Nations or Tribes of Indians," and even mor

portantly through its explicit recognition of Indigenous pre-existi

continued title to the lands, the British Crown initially recogn

sovereignty of Indian Nations in its 1763 Royal Proclamation . It d

that all Indigenous land would remain as such until ceded by treaty
the Crown; only the Crown could buy land from First Nations or

ate treaties.58 The newly formed Dominion of Canada, which at th

22 PEACE RESEARCH | Vol. 49, No. 2 (2017)
consisted of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, honored
the Crowns Proclamation by initiating a series of formal treaties across the

western areas of the land so that these Indian lands could become part of
the new Dominion rather than be absorbed into the United States through
Manifest Destiny.59
As the land is the key factor, the Crown envisioned the treaties as land

cession treaties, which arguably removed Aboriginal title from the First

Nations' ancestral lands in Canada.60 Early treaties were concerned with
military or economic relationships between Britain and its colonies. In the
process of colonialism in North America, the settler state secured the territories by dispossessing the Aboriginal peoples from their ancestral lands.61

However, for reasons that are still open to a wide range of debate, the

new Dominion also began a simultaneous process of exerting complete
control over every aspect of Indians lives and lands through its 1876 Indian

Act.61 Even with the use of modern "nation-to-nation" treaties through
Comprehensive Land Claims, the people are still "Indian" people, meaning
wards of the Canadian government under the confines of the Indian Act;
their relationships with Canada fall under Canadas Constitution (1982). 63
This calls the legitimacy of "nation-to-nation" relationships into question.

With a few exceptions through modern agreements, such as Sechelt and
Tswwassen First Nations who have debatable forms of self-governance over

their lands, the majority of First Nations in Canada fall wholly within the
paternalistic Indian Act.64

Warfare, spatial displacement, and the assimilation of Indigenous
peoples into the colonized society were evident in Canada.65 In colonialism, "settlers carry sovereignty with them and found new political orders
in the spaces they colonialize."66 Before the late twentieth century, many
British colonized countries, including the Western democracies of Canada,
the United States Australia, and New Zealand, undertook assimilating and
marginalizing policies to deal with Indigenous peoples.67 The governments
and colonizers resorted to policies including, "stripping Indigenous peoples
of their lands, restricting the practice of their traditional cultures, languages,

and religions, and undermining their institutions of self-government" to

assimilate Indigenous peoples so that they do not sustain themselves as
distinct cultures.68

The Art of Breaking People Downenous Peoples 23
Removal of Indigenous People from Their Land ' Livelihoods , and Sustenance

Colonization transferred 99.64 percent of the land from Indigenous peoples

to the colonizers hands.69 Clearly, the British takeover of Indigenous lands
led to a loss of livelihood for the Indigenous nations.

Particularly in Western Canada, starvation and mass infestations reduced the numbers of Indigenous people significantly, arguably for easier
access for the settlers to the land and its resources.70 British political colo-

nization and its child, the Dominion of Canada, took Indigenous land and
exploited resources such as minerals and timber for their own economic
interests.71 In Western Canada, British colonization initially occurred economically through the world s first multinational company: the Hudson Bay

Company (HBC).72 Through the 1670 Charter between the Crown of
England and the Company, Britain assumed control and ownership of what
it called Rupertsland, which included, "almost a million and a half square
miles of western and northern Canada, more than 40 percent of the modern
nation."73

Because the HBC was dependent on Indigenous people to supply
the profit-making furs, Indigenous groups like the Homeguard Indians
around York Factory were initially treated as economic partners. The Cree

Homeguards and others acted as brokers with more-inland Indigenous
people and controlled who could do business with the Company.74
The various Indigenous groups in what is now Canada had a very different understanding of and relationships with the land than the British.
Within the Indigenous worldview, everything is related and to be held in
balance, particularly the environment.75 For Indigenous peoples, the land
was attached to many aspects of life, and not just used for material gains.76

The Cree attached their Indigenous system of healing and medicine to the
land. The Ininews forest spirituality is reflected in their view of hunting
practices as holy and involving spiritual relationships, not as technical practices as imposed by the HBC regarding their caribou hunting.77

As the HBC and other colonizing forces grew, this balance was no
longer maintained. As Europeans, primarily British, expanded across the
land, Indigenous numbers decreased through the mass epidemics, resultant
and forced starvation, and the loss of their food sources.78 Indigenous people
became reliant on British governing and economic forces for their survival. It
is for these reasons that the Numbered Treaties in the Prairie part of Western

Canada were signed.79

24 PEACE RESEARCH | Vol. 49, No. 2 (2017)
The Treaties Between Nations Morphed into The 1876 Indian Act
While the stated intent of the numbered treaties in the Prairies was to come
to an agreement to share the land, it quickly became apparent that there were

dichotomously opposing interpretations of the treaties. While Indigenous
nations understood them to mean that the land was now being peacefully

shared, the Crown decided that it now had ownership of the lands and
could unilaterally decide its uses, which included making it available for
mass immigration from many areas of the world.80

This led to ever increasing needs for the lands that had been set aside
for Indian reserves. One response was to enact the 1876 Indian Act, which
gave unilateral control over Indians to the Crown. This included determining who was and who was not recognized as status Indians, non-status, and
Metis or Halfbreeds; deciding for Indigenous people who they could be and
where they could and could not live on reserves was similar to the evolution
of the Bantu of apartheid in South Africa where local people were forced to
live by the Afrikaner government.81 The Crown determined that the answer

to the Indian Problem lay in assimilating them into Canada.
British forms of government were based on individual leaders with political authority. All Indian forms of government, such as the highly revered

Haudenosaunee, were outlawed through the Indian Act , which replaced
them with a generic chief and band council system that was uniformly
imposed across the land.82
Discriminatory Laws

The British and French colonizers profiled Indians in North America as
savages or inferior races; the myth of the "noble savage" was used as a tool
to deny them equality and human rights while genocide served to eradicate

them.83 Discriminatory laws like the Indian Act (1876) gave the Canadian
government authority to try to assimilate Indians into mainstream Britishformed Canada. Indigenous peoples were considered far too inferior in their
traditional ways to be accepted into British-determined Canadian society.84
In an effort to repress Indigenous peoples and prevent resistance, status

Indians were only first allowed to vote in federal or provincial elections in

1961. Until 1951, they were not allowed to retain their identity as status
Indians if they attended university or fought for Canadas Armed Forces.
Indians were not allowed to gather in groups of more than three or four
to prevent political discussions or hire a lawyer to represent their political

interests. In the prairies, some Indian agents illegitimately invoked the Indian Act to prevent Indians from leaving their communities for any reason
without a signed pass.85
Residential Schools

Residential schools were used to colonize and destroy the culture of Aboriginal children from the late 1800s until the 1990s. This system was
designed to produce English-speaking Indians who adopted the white men s
Canadian-British culture. To accomplish assimilation, the goal was to have
them think, act, and live like Canadian British subjects. This was most evident within the Indian Residential Schools (IRSs) where the stated purpose
was to wget the Indian out of the child." Attempts at education through day

schools had proved to be lacking since the children went home at night and

continued to speak with their families in their own languages and live by
their own ways.86

Children were removed from their families by force and by laying
criminal charges against parents if required. In 1920, the Deputy Minister

of Indian Affairs, Dr. Duncan Campbell Scott, wanted to get rid of the
Indian problem': "Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian
in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic."87 At the peak of

the residential school system, the government funded eighty-three schools
to educate twenty to thirty percent of the native population in Canada and

the last of these institutions was closed in 1996 in Regina, Saskatchewan.88

The proportions in western Canada were most probably higher, and the
exact numbers are still not actually known due to poor record keeping.

In 1906, the Canadian Tuberculosis Association determined that almost seventy-five percent of 1RS students died before they reached the age
of eighteen due to insufficient health services; all were subjected to British
colonization indoctrination.89 Half of the Indian children received no higher
than grade six education at most through the residential schools90 and First

Nations students currently on reserve receive three to six thousand dollars
less funding each year than all other students.91 Statistics still reflect a grossly

disproportionate high school graduation rate for First Nations people: fortyfive percent compared to sixty-five percent for non-Indigenous.92

With the vast majority of the students physically, sexually and emotionally abused, improperly fed, and often forced to labour throughout their

childhoods, the schools run by the Christian churches are now considered to

be imprisonment centers for severely traumatized children. The 1RS system
was linked to poverty, poor health, mental illness, language loss, spiritual loss,

rape and sexual abuse, and cultural destruction that together was damaging
to Indigenous communities in Canada with lasting impacts today.93 Due to
these residential schools, Indigenous people across Canada have witnessed
an escalation in sexual abuse, alcoholism, depression, and the murder and
disappearance of young Aboriginal women.94 Culture shock, disorientation,
and confusion surrounded the survivors of the residential schools and made
them feel hopeless as well as resilient through their cultures.95

The transgenerational transmission of trauma to future generations
is inevitable from the Canadian Aboriginal peoples' colonized past.96 Parents' role in teaching their children about their culture and community is
denigrated and their language, as well as cultural pride, is lost. Ultimately,
intergenerational communications are also affected by this traumatic past.
As the schools closed, the children were literally transferred into the child
welfare system. This led to losses of children into non-Indigenous adoptions
and foster placements. Currently, there are more Indigenous children in the
care of child welfare than at the height of the IRSs.97

After 1RS survivors began to file lawsuits against the Canadian govern-

ment and the churches that ran the schools, the Supreme Court of Canada
opted to respond collectively with a Truth and Reconciliation Commission
(TRC). For several years, the Commission heard testimony from survivors
and their families who were affected by the schools as well as some former
staff. The volumes of grief, despair, anger, and resiliency within the testimo-

nies led to the 94 Calls to Action, which specify in detail how the Canadian
government and society can begin work for reconciliation98.

Spiritual Colonization
Spiritual colonization permeated the society and was arguably the most destructive colonial force. The efforts at assimilation were targeted against all

aspects of Indigenous peoples' lives, including their languages, stories, and
spiritual practices. Prior to the governing forces of either Britain or France,

Christian missionaries of all denominations arrived with the explorers and
they traveled into the communities in the first wave of settlers. They also

provided information about whether Indians were actually human or not
and if they were deserving of being converted to Christianity.99 In the end,

they were deemed worthy of conversion, including forced conversion, but

were not human enough to warrant full recognition of their rights to their
own lands and sovereign nations.100
In Canada, the British colonizers imposed Christianity through the Indian Acts outlawing of traditional practices under threat of imprisonment;
they also used genocidal means such as the residential schools where children

were reprogrammed.101 This resulted in many spiritual practices being kept

underground, taking place at night and far from the communities and the
watchful eyes of the Indian agents and the local churches. While these covert

practices have ensured the continuation of the original spiritualties, the
impact of the colonization of spirituality is still very evident today. Within
communities and even nuclear families, there are rifts between those who
practice Christianity and those who practice traditional forms of spirituality,

with some practicing both.
Spiritual colonization has also affected the transmission of knowledge.
Indigenous people state that their knowledge is found indivisibly within their

languages and their lands. While the transmission of knowledge through
language and stories was severely attacked, there were enough covert exchanges of information and practice of ceremonies to keep the knowledge
and ways alive and lead to the contemporary process of renaissance.102

The colonization process in Canada has had destabilizing effects on
Canadian Indigenous peoples.103 The British colonial model sought to
destroy people s relationship and connectivity to the land that is the basis of

every Indigenous persons spirituality in Canada.104 For example, the Sayisi
Dene and the Cree approach to caribou hunting was radically altered due to
colonization, despite their maintenance of spiritual human-animal relationships and practices of "respect" to animals.105 The actual destruction of the

land, environment, and food sources in the past continues today through
ongoing oil and gas, mineral, and timber exploitation. Communities near
these resources are ecologically and socially affected, under-funded with
little to no resources, and facing great loss of life through resulting suicide.106

force. The underlying principles of the different terms or constructs used for

Ireland and Canada are based on the same logic: a divide and rule strategy
through creation of apartheid laws that suppress and treat local people as
inferior. Some contend that divide and rule continues in Ireland with the
partition of the six counties in Northern Ireland. It continues in Canada
most obviously in Canada's continuing determination of Indigenous identities - status versus non-status versus Metis - which then determines which
Indigenous rights the individual may or may not have, even dividing families
with these distinctions.

The primary goal has been the same: access to Indigenous lands for
their economic potential. The peoples of Indigenous lands are either used
as a means to access the lands potential - tenant farmers in Ireland and
guides and brokers in the fur trade in Canada - or removed to clear access
to more lands, as seen in (for example) forced emigration from Ireland in
the coffin ships and forced containment onto small reserves in Canada and

forced relocation to urban centres. Attempts to access Indigenous lands
and resources continue particularly in Canada, as evidenced by the modern
treaty processes, as well as efforts at colonized-based resource extractions.107

Britain damaged the relationships between the Indigenous peoples and
the land, nature, and spirit world, as well as hampering the resiliency poten-

tial of the local populations.108 Biological and psychological damage was so
severe that historical intergenerational trauma affects the survivors and their

children's children. Healing and reconciliation have become a challenge in
the postcolonial Irish and Canadian contexts.109 In Ireland, the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement has decreased political and direct violence; however, the
social and economic stressors continue between the two groups in a liminal
type of negative peace.1 10 In Canada, there are still multiple outstanding land

claims as well as conflict over resource development. First Nations children
are still severely underfunded, to the point of loss of life, and lacking both
basic and special needs services on reserve.111

Through economic and political control and cultural subjugation with

respect to the native peoples' languages, education, religious beliefs, and
practices, British colonialism has been destructive in both Ireland and Canada. According to the Canadian TRC, the Indian residential school system
has served as an element of Canada's century-long Aboriginal policy that
was, "devised to destroy Aboriginal government, to deny Aboriginal rights,
to terminate Treaties, and to assimilate Aboriginal people by damaging their

existence as a distinct socio-cultural entity."112

The TRC termed this process as cultural genocide: "the destruction of
those structures and practices that allow the group to continue as a group."1 13

The state s cultural genocidal activities were the destruction of the social and

political institutions of the Aboriginal peoples, including the forbiddance of
spiritual practices, seizure of land, forced displacement, restriction of move-

ment, banning of languages, persecution of spiritual leaders, and prevention
of the intergenerational transmission of cultural values and identity through
disrupting families.114

Canadas former Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an apology in
June 2008 that confirmed the intent of destruction of Indigenous culture:

"These objectives were based on the assumption Aboriginal cultures and
spiritual beliefs were inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was
infamously said, 'to kill the Indian in the child/ Today, we recognize that
this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no
place in our country."115

In 1997, one hundred and fifty years after the Famine, Britain also
issued an apology: "remorse for Britain s failure to offer greater assistance."116

Former British Prime Minister Tony Blairs 1997 apology went a long way in
the healing process of the Irish nation and was critical to the success of the
1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended thirty years of political strife and
violence in Northern Ireland.117

According to the Canadian TRCs Calls to Action, reconciliation
through objective actions can heal and repair many social injustices faced

by the Aboriginal peoples in Canada and can address the lack of the
mainstream settler society s education and awareness regarding Indigenous
peoples, history, and Treaties. The TRC makes it clear that reconciliation
and healing must address the religious, linguistic, and cultural consequences

of residential schools and the humiliation endured by Indigenous peoples.

Indigenous knowledge based relational justice and healing practices can
restore the independence of the Indigenous communities so that they can
again have a life of purpose.118

While there were official apologies to Irish people and Indigenous
peoples in Canada, it is apparent that colonization continues and is not
limited to history. It has remained resilient and in existence.

CONCLUSION? OR CONTINUING RESILIENCE AND
RESISTANCE?

Even with apologies and some acts towards reconciliation in both Irelan

and Canada, there is clearly unfinished business required in order to m

beyond British colonization. Colonization in both places is not yet ov

which is why there is not an actual conclusion. The resistance and resilie
continues to this day.

In Ireland, the resistance has morphed from violent conflict in Nort

ern Ireland to peaceful resistance within the governing structures of t

Good Friday Agreement. Irish language and culture is gaining strength a

prominence.119 In Canada, Indigenous people continue resistance throug

mostly victorious court action for land claims and through cultural rene
with increasing use of Indigenous languages and cultural practices.120
British colonization has left its indelible mark on both Ireland and

Canada. Nonetheless, the Irish and Indigenous peoples of Canadas cultures
are revitalizing to the credit of their lasting connections with their unique
identities. British colonization has been devastating but it has not succeeded

in overpowering the Irish or Canadian Indigenous peoples.
