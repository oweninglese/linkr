CHAPTER THREE

Frank B. Wilderson III & Tiffany Lethabo King

Staying Ready for Black Study
A Conversation

Part 1

I had never met or talked with Frank prior to our telephone conversation in
the summer of July 2017.1 I had, however, encountered his work and continued to ­labor with his thoughts and prose. I had developed my own relationship to his texts and an intimacy that I thought was unique and singular.
Coming into the conversation, I had a par­tic­u­lar investment in his elaborate
cartographies that mapped the ontological positions in the United States in
his book Red, White & Black.2 I had worked very hard to understand the
schema of the coordinates of whiteness and its world-­making proj­ect. I had
become clearer over the years about the ways that the articulation of a sovereign self by “the Native” intersected with the circle of white civil society.
And I had come to appreciate and even found the possibility for kinship in
the space of the other half of Native p
­ eople’s circle—­genocide—­that overlapped with Black ­people’s social death in the Venn diagram of the triadic
relationship.
I had studied them, written about them, and set about crafting an understanding of how to be with, think with, trust or not the possibility of sharing
the world and f­ uture with Indigenous p
­ eoples. I admit I came to the conversation with investments. And investments that I wanted to deposit more of
my po­liti­cal desires into.
Frank came to our engagement differently. While I c­ an’t speak for his
intentions, investments, or even anx­i­eties about the conversation, he was
poised for a dif­fer­ent kind of meeting. Frank seemed to see an opening
and a possibility in our exchange. Frank had never met me, but he immediately wanted to talk about an article that I had recently written. I was
caught off guard. Frank is without the academic pretense that I have often
encountered—­even when the scholar pretends that it is not t­here. I was

surprised not by the generosity but by Frank’s earnest desire to be open. To
be changed by the encounter. I had to recalibrate. I was not prepared for this
opening, this possibility and moment made for Black study.
As you w
­ ill notice, during my fourth question and response to Wilderson’s
articulation of coming into an uncompromising critique and understanding
of Native subject formation—­through Jared Sexton—­I switch topics.3 I start
by conceding that this critique is difficult for some Indigenous scholars and
activists “to swallow” but do not admit or talk through my own anxiety
and am about the critique. I flee, reluctant to confront the anti-­Blackness
­required in the formation of sovereign Native subjects in the white genocidal and anti-­Black nations of the United States and Canada. I cut the conversation short ­here.
Rather than pursue and talk through this anxiety in the first conversation, I cut the exchange short. A
­ fter a few days of reflecting on our con­
versation, I reached out to Frank again. In the spirit of Black study and in
order to reciprocate the generosity of Frank’s engagement I asked him for
another conversation. We picked up at the space of my angst in part two of
our conversation weeks l­ater.4 This time I was prepared for a convening, a
meeting, a chance to layer and even unmoor myself. This was the kind of exchange that Frank made himself available for. In the acad­emy, I rarely have
to be ready to respond to p
­ eople changing their minds. It is rare to not have
to perform or not be ready to perform. It is rare to have to be open to being
affected. Engaging with Frank requires being prepared to talk through—­and
study—­your own stuff with each other. It is to break open and out in order
to reconnect at another possibility, another way to think. It is the pro­cess
of Black study with someone. We talked about a number of ­things in this
conversation (Afro-­pessimism, gender, citing Black w
­ omen scholars, the
“Black body,” Native studies), but more importantly we talked about what
we held out hope for and what we have given up on in the hopes of desiring
something ­else.
TK

Frank, I want to start with some context for our conversation. In 2015,
a conference entitled “Other­wise Worlds” was held to provide a less
mediated exchange between Native and Black studies scholars to see
how we might be able speak to each other. At times, the conversation
was difficult. But it was also productive in that we could be honest with
each other and admit what we did not know about each other’s fields.
This conference is the basis for this anthology and the conversation we
are having t­ oday. While the conference provides some of the ­context,

I have been looking forward to our meeting for more personal reasons. Your work has been invaluable for my own development as a
scholar, as well as for helping me orient myself within the po­liti­cal and
ethical discussions that take place in the Amer­i­cas.
Before, I went into the acad­emy I worked for the Philadelphia Unemployment Proj­ect for several years in Philadelphia. I got burnt out
­after ten years in the white nonprofit world and strug­gled a lot with
the white left. I was also a member of the Black Radical Congress—
of which factions w
­ ere informed by the Marxism of the Communist
Party USA—­and the Philadelphia chapter of the National Co­ali­tion
of Blacks for Reparations (ncobra). When I went to the acad­emy in
2009 and encountered your book in 2010 it was a relief. It affirmed me
and allowed me to feel okay about many of the reservations I was feeling and critiques that I had about my po­liti­cal life and activism. It was
such a relief to have my exhaustion with Marxists affirmed, many of
whom w
­ ere found­ers of the nonprofits in Philadelphia. Your worked
affirmed my suspicions with Marxist theory.
FW

What you ­were butting up against in Philly was similar to what the
Communist Party was d
­ oing in the ANC [African National Congress].
It was ­really hard to get around that without becoming a Black re­nais­
sance Afrocentric person. We are refugees of other ­peoples’ proj­ects.

TK

Yes, that is very true. In terms of your book, Red, White & Black, I have
always had questions about your interest in Indigenous thought. Why
was that of interest to you and why did it become so central to your
work in Red, White & Black?

FW

I’m not sure where it started. AIM [the American Indian Movement]
was started in my city not too far from where I lived. So the issues of
Native American sovereignty and the demands of AIM ­were part of
the University of Minnesota landscape. Looking back on that, I see
some of the prob­lems. One of the ­things was my Dad was ­running a
program on a reservation; it was a joint program with the tribal government. One day, t­ here was a meeting, and p
­ eople on the reservation
did not want to adhere to some of the requirements of the University
of Minnesota for which it was a joint program. Po­liti­cally, I thought
his institutional interests ­were wrong and the Indigenous ­peoples’ interests ­were right. I thought the University should turn over the resources. At the same time, t­ here was an affective charge that had more

to do with my Dad as a Black person than with him being a representative of the university. The tribal representatives said, “We d
­ on’t want
you, a nigger man, telling us what to do.”
In grad school, I was thinking about how the institutionality of indigeneity is a function of the very concrete resources the university, as
a settler formation, took from them. Th
­ ere was also something impor­
tant in the libidinal economy that the most highly charged imago is
anti-­Blackness. Anti-­Blackness is driving the quest for sovereignty as
much as the desire to get rid of the settler.
TK

That origin story is so impor­tant and enlightening to me. Your experience of growing up where ­people are constantly negotiating Indigenous sovereignty in the Midwest is very dif­fer­ent from my experience on the East Coast. I grew up outside of Philly in Wilmington,
Delaware, and the lack of Native institutions—­and the general erasure
of Native presence—­did not allow the anti-­Blackness of Native p
­ eople
to surface on a regular basis. It also enables folks on the East Coast to
think that Native p
­ eople ­aren’t around and negotiating with the state
on a regular basis. I was allowed to set up a romantic relationship with
Indigenous ­peoples, where I could fill in absences and create t­ hese alternative histories where we worked in alliance and d
­ idn’t bump up
against each other when ­there was a fight for local resources.

FW

I can say that I had some anxiety about making this critique about this
presumptive logic in light of the fact that millions of Native p
­ eople
have been massacred. But in hindsight, I accept [Jared] Sexton’s article [in this volume] as a corrective to my work. You have two ­things
­running. I have deep anger t­owards the settler state and sorrow for
the millions that w
­ ere genocided. And at the same time, I have this
critique, which is uncompromising, about Native subject formation.
A critique that says one cannot be “Indian” or anything ­else without
being anti-­Black. It is a necessary ele­ment to being alive.

TK

*That is hard to swallow for Indigenous folks. It is also hard for me
to swallow, and I find myself stuck, conflicted, and unresolved about
that.
­Toward another direction, I have been in conversations with ­others
and myself about how white and non-­Black folks are taking up Afro-­
pessimism. Some of my anxiety is emerging when and where I see
non-­Black folks working ­under the guise of, “I’m ­doing the po­liti­cal

work and exposing anti-­Black racism,” but they are primarily d
­ oing
their antiracist po­liti­cal work through theorizing Black death and flesh.
I often see ­these folks thinking of, or theorizing, Black death and flesh
at the level of meta­phor and aestheticizing it in order to make it more
malleable. This then becomes “the work.” I find myself recoiling from
that kind of work. Do you have any thoughts about what white and
non-­Black folks are ­doing with Black death and Afro-­pessimistic work?
FW

I hear exactly what ­you’re saying, and I grieve over it. Sometimes, I
try not to know to get my own work done. As a general rule, it is difficult for Black ­people to make anything and to hold onto it for more
than thirty seconds before the world takes it for its own purposes.
Afro-­pessimism is g­ oing the way of jazz, where it w
­ ill be for every­one
­else. Or hip-­hop. Patrice Douglass asked me, how do we keep Afro-­
pessimism for Blacks? And I said, it’s like our bodies, we ­can’t. What
it becomes is something to animate someone e­ lse’s proj­ects, and then
­we’ll be dispossessed of Being. That ­doesn’t mean I’m not writing, but
Id
­ on’t know what to do about it. It’s akin to lynching as David Marriott
describes. The lynched body becomes something through which community can build ­because it is the not quite ­human t­hing to which
­Humans can ultimately compare themselves.

TK

I had a Black queer ­woman gradu­ate student who told me about how
her white professor thoughtlessly (or maybe not) displayed photos of
lynched Black bodies the very weeks that Philando Castile and Alton
Sterling ­were murdered. She became ill during the class and left. She
eventually withdrew from the class. I never cease to be surprised by
the way that non-­Black ­people just play with Blackness. I ­don’t know
what to do with non-­Black students who want to work on Blackness;
luckily, I have not had that many make the attempt. Have you had to
deal with white and non-­Black students who want to engage Black
studies through Black bodies? What is your response?

FW

The response is an art and not a science. Each time has its own context.
As a general rule, I am more direct, and preliminarily set bound­aries
more with gradu­ate students than undergraduate students. If I am
dealing with an undergraduate student, I think they might be wrongheaded but earnest. At UCI [UC Irvine], our relationship with undergrad students is often mediated through TAs. With grad students, I
try to say, “what I would like you to do is take down your own p
­ eople;

as opposed to fetishizing and wallowing in Blackness.” The insurgent
gesture in Afro-­pessimism is that t­ here is not just a grammar of Black
suffering but a fin­ger that points to humanity as being deserving of
destruction ­because of its very being and not just its actions. In other
words, it’s an unflinching critique of ­Human capacity, rather than a
critique of unethical and/or discriminatory acts performed. That aspect, that affective side of Afro-­pessimism, is impor­tant for giving
critical recognition to Black rage for your existence, your capacity to
be ­Human, and not just your actions. This part is rarely taken up. Non-­
Black ­people cannot fathom the fact that it’s their cultural coherence
and not their cultural practices that is the prob­lem.
TK

Thank you. Th
­ ere is so much work that could be done on whiteness
and how its coherence requires parasitism in order to survive. I think
white folks have so much to do in that re­spect. ­There is this ongoing and enduring question of how does whiteness require Black death.
Deal with that. What’s with this obsession with us?

FW

Your question about the students is r­ eally deep. What it reminds us of
is that we are in a novel position of having some authority while, at the
same time, the student is our master. I supervise their exams, ­etc. But
at the level of paradigm, I am their slave. When they get huffy, they are
speaking through that paradigm. In the moment, I ­can’t say I ­will only
work with ­people with whom I agree with their politics. But I w
­ ill say,
this is how it’s g­ oing to be: I w
­ ill push back. You d
­ on’t have to agree.
You have to show me that you understand the material, not that you
agree with me, or that you consider yourself to be an Afro-pessimist.
That’s all you need to do to get your PhD and have me sign off on it.
But what I w
­ on’t do is blurb your book when you publish your dissertation. I d
­ on’t want your reputation intertwined with mine beyond our
professor-­student relationship. I have work to do in the world (beyond
the acad­emy); work which does not include you.

TK

That makes me think about what I should be investing in as I work
with non-­Black students. I cannot make my supervision of non-­Black
students about their transformation into being a non anti-­Black person. That ­will take much longer than the two years I have with them
or the seven or so years you might spend with a doctoral student. Why
burden myself with that commitment? Your insight about our paradigmatic relationship as slaves having to answer to our masters (as

students) makes me think more deeply about where the push back
comes from when a student says, “this is what I want.” It r­ eally is, as
you say, a demand that “you need to make it happen.” It is not just
about the intellectual or po­liti­cal differences that emerge between
Black professors and students but the power relations between master
and slave. As Afro-­pessimism becomes sexy and not “ours” anymore,
­these are ­things to think about.
FW

In your recent article, you critique Deleuzian scholars who desire
posthumanity ­because they have a humanity that depends upon Black
and Indigenous genocide. How did you come to write that?

TK

I wrote the article, “­Humans Involved: Lurking in the Lines of Post
­Humanist Flight,” in response to what I still see as an uncritical and
celebratory reception of Deleuzian and Guattarian nonrepre­sen­ta­
tional theory by white folks.5 I think its ability to escape white embodiment and, more specifically, white vio­lence while claiming to have
in­ven­ted a “new” way of encountering the ­human and nonhuman material world as fundamentally interconnected is only pos­si­ble through
the murder of Indigenous and Black ­people. More specifically, what
enrages me is the way that nonrepre­sen­ta­tional and posthumanist discourse disavows Indigenous worldviews that ­don’t (and for centuries
did not) rely on the western bound­aries between h
­ uman and ­things in
order to discover t­ hese white “new materialisms” as if they had not existed before. It is precisely b
­ ecause white conquistadors and colonizers
wiped out t­ hese Indigenous worldviews that they can be rediscovered
as new and novel. White p
­ eople should pay attention to this genocidal
pro­cess of disavowal in their own epistemic systems. That’s a proj­ect.

TK

I had an opportunity to meet Saidiya Hartman recently. However, I
was not able to talk about her 2003 conversation with you.6 This might
be my projection, but your exchange with her in “The Position of the
Untought” made me think about my recent experiences with abolitionist politics and activism. I remember that in that interview, you
had some concerns about it, specifically who the leadership was, who
is participating, and how it was becoming vis­i­ble. Can you say more
about your feelings about the prison abolition movement as it currently
exists and how ­people are conceiving of conceptualizing abolition?

FW

I ­don’t know much about it in the pre­sent. But in 2002, Jared Sexton,
Zakiyyah Jackson, and I ­were involved in dif­fer­ent kinds of abolition

spaces in Berkeley at the time. We w
­ ere involved in trying to get po­
liti­cal prisoners released. We ­were also involved in the first launch of
Critical Re­sis­tance while we w
­ ere in gradu­ate school. What I felt was
happening was that the Critical Re­sis­tance p
­ eople in general ­were
thinking captivity as a common paradigm for all ­people and not understanding the rise of the prison industrial complex. They ­were construing the rising rates of incarceration of Latino and Asian men, and
more Latina and Asian ­women, as of a parallel universe to the captivity
of Black p
­ eople. Incarceration and captivity for Latinos, Asians, and
Muslims is a function of a historic experience; but captivity is a constituent ele­ment of Black life. If we read Saidiya Hartman’s Scenes of
Subjection as an allegory of the pre­sent, then we can begin to see how
consent cannot figure into the adjudication of Black injury, b
­ ecause
Black p
­ eople are not endowed with consent—to be ­either solicited or
­violated. Specifically, she is talking about how the rape of Black female
slaves cannot be considered a violation (which ­causes the pro­cess of
adjudication to cave in on itself) b
­ ecause she has no consent that can
be abrogated by way of sexual violation. (Yes, her examples are from
the nineteenth c­ entury, but they are paradigmatically applicable t­ oday.
The end of chattel slavery does not mark the end of slavery.) But it also
means that the word “injury” is a word that gains no coherence when
it comes to Black p
­ eople. I felt that if we w
­ ere to read Hartman’s work,
not as a historical document, but as an allegory of the pre­sent, that
we can see that the legibility of other p
­ eople’s historical experience
[of captivity] is dependent upon Black ­people’s ubiquitous and trans­
historical paradigm of captivity. Jared makes this point in his article
[in this volume] that abolition as a politics is never about resurgence,
recovery, or recuperation. It would be okay if Black ­peoples could be
in co­ali­tion to provide the scaffolding for recovery, resurgence, and
­recuperation. But we also know that we have Black ­people in the room,
and so it’s about something dif­fer­ent. The abolition movement w
­ asn’t
willing to do that; I ­don’t think any movement is willing to do that. As
Hartman says, no one wants to be as f­ree as Black p
­ eople w
­ ill make
them, b
­ ecause they w
­ ill be ­free of their own cultural coordinates, not
just ­free of their oppressive dynamics. Let’s work from ­there. What
Sexton is talking about in abolition through Blackness is degeneration,
decline, and dissolution. An uprooting of the notion of presenting any
order of determination from taking root; a politics without claim or
even demand; a politics whose demand is too radical to be formulated

in advance of its deeds. That’s what makes Black bodies so exciting to
­people at one level and so terrifying at another register. What I saw is
that what Critical Re­sis­tance r­ eally wanted was the affect, the energy
that comes from the demand of Blackness, a politics without a claim,
but it wanted to contain that within a very coherent and purposeful
vision of resurgence, recovery, and recuperation. That is what I mean
about Blackness as the refugee of other ­peoples’ movements.
Hartman was at Berkeley at the time and her book, Scenes of Subjection, blew me away.7 I used to be a post-­Gramscian and worked
with the Communist Party in South Africa. But when folks like [Michael] Hardt talk about the lack of consent, they mean that now with
globalization, the command modality of capitalism imposes its w
­ ill
ubiquitously across the globe; ­there is no longer the space and time
of respite once vouchsafed by hegemony and civil society. But Hartman shows that Black ­peoples never operated through consent. For us,
­there’s nothing temporal about the loss of consent; one cannot narrate
this loss this way. Subalterns can, but Blacks cannot. ­There’s nothing
temporal (or historical) about the loss of something one never possessed. So why ­can’t we think abolition through that. The abolition
movement is the place for white joy and excitement, but it’s not about
abolition as it could be.
TK

Even though ­you’re reflecting back on this dynamic in your past experiences, you are speaking about dynamics that exist in the current moment. This year, I went to a training that was or­ga­nized by a co­ali­tion
of multiracial social justice activists in the city of Atlanta with the goal
of introducing folks to the concept of abolition. I showed up, expecting to see the usual folks from the Black social justice community, and
80 ­percent of the p
­ eople w
­ ere white. It was also being facilitated by
a white presenting person—­they may have identified as a person of
color—to my dismay. I de­cided this w
­ asn’t the place for me, as ­people
­were talking about “reforming the prison away” or becoming excited
by the idea that as a Marxist a part of the work of abolition was “abolishing the notion that cops ­were workers” to make themselves feel
better. This was not the conversation I wanted to have. The energy of
Blackness was animating the room but Black ­people ­were not ­there.
Abolition now has this currency in activist movements, and its momentum is certainly animated by Black strug­gle but not necessarily
Black ­people.

On another note, Frank, I definitely see the influence of Hartman
on your work. I’m now thinking about and concerned about how we
engage and cite her work within the Afro-­pessimistic tradition. I and
a few other Black ­women are noticing and talking about how they see
­people invoke your work and Jared’s work, but they ­don’t even cite
or know Hartman’s work. How can we address some of the sexism in
the acad­emy that avoids taking Hartman seriously? How do we take
misogyny seriously within the Black intramural?
FW

I am so in agreement with you. Critical theory has been a masculinist
space. I am upset about the lack of citational practice. Are you talking
about Afro-­pessimism specifically?

TK	­Those who use an Afro-­pessimistic frame. ­People ­will cite you and

Jared, but when asked if they have read Saidiya Hartman, they d
­ on’t
know her work. And no one wants to take this on in terms of this par­
tic­u­lar kind of erasure. How do we interrupt this masculinist tendency
to just cite Black men in Black critical theory?

FW

I ­don’t have a programmatic answer to that. The moniker “Say Her
Name” is something we can think of with this. Afro-­pessimism is an
outgrowth of Black feminist theory; particularly the work of Spillers
and Hartman have helped us think about structure and relationality.
The term comes from the 2002 interview and it’s Hartman’s word; it’s
not my word. This is the prob­lem of Afro-­pessimism, as you have pointed
out, and Black studies in general. Scholars cite Black men more than
Black ­women. We should see how the lessons in Hartman’s book provide a spotlight on the intramural as it relates to gender. She writes
about how a Black w
­ oman was raped by her master, and then kills
him and goes on trial. The l­awyer adjudicated the case by highlighting the injury to the Black man’s pride rather than the Black w
­ oman’s
body. The point is that in the libidinal economy, the value of masculine
violation is so high as to erase the ­actual real bodily trauma of Black
females. The only way Black injury could be i­magined to have a voice
is through the Black male defendant. This dynamic is carried over into
po­liti­cal organ­izing as well as in Afro-­pessimism. Intuitively, t­here is
the centering of the Black male voice with the Black female voice being
unthought. Hopefully this can be highlighted ­because this erasure is
the very ­thing that Afro-­pessimism is talking about.

TK

How do we take up gender within an Afro-­pessimistic frame?

FW

I ­don’t like to be prescriptive. But what I find is necessary is the way
in which vio­lence is thought and mediated on through sexuality. Vio­
lence happens through Blackness without an endgame. That impinges
upon ­every area of Black life. Vio­lence is constitutive of sexuality in
Blackness in a way that it is not constitutive in other subjects. One has
to move through the categories even if they d
­ on’t apply structurally.
The vio­lence that produces the slave cannot be consented to by the
slave ­because the slave cannot provide consent. That makes you a very
dif­fer­ent kind of sexual being than a person who can consent. [Judith]
Butler, brilliant as she is, has not been able to theorize a vio­lence that
happens prior signification (meaning prior to instantiation as a subject) in the way Hartman has. And it is this regime of vio­lence which
actually forecloses the possibility of Black ­people being positioned as
­Human subjects (and, again, makes ­Human subjects legible as subjects
in contradistinction to the Slave).

TK

And Spillers. I tell students to pay attention to what Spillers says at the
end of “Mama’s Baby, Papa’s Maybe.” If t­hese categories d
­ on’t cohere
at the level of flesh, we are ­people who ­don’t have anything to prove,
right? ­There’s no way you are g­ oing to fulfill the mandates of heteronormativity, or even queerness, right? It’s not ­going to work for you.
Thank you for taking both of them so seriously in your work. Now,
I want to spend this last bit of time we have asking about what you are
working on? I know that you used to be in a theater department. How
is that experience and training informing your current work?

FW

Writing can be very anxiety-­producing. Or at least it is for me. What
we are dealing with as Black critical thinkers is painful stuff. The cost
of an Afro-­pessimistic book is higher than a Deleuzian book. Can one
actually write Afro-­pessimistic books? ­There’s a lot of interest in Afro-­
pessimism, and that is not always a good t­ hing. It’s akin to the deployment of black bodies in theater departments at universities. I used to
work in such a department. It ­wasn’t a fun ­thing to watch.
­There is so much pornotroping of Black men and w
­ omen in t­ hese
departments when they stage plays. I had to fight ­these ­battles, so I
had to transfer my line. One of the members of the department (who
did not want to go on the rec­ord) told me that a white ­woman in that
department had had the nerve to say, “­We’re all over ­here suffering
from post-­traumatic Frank syndrome.” When I was just speaking up

for Black p
­ eople, telling them, “Stop staging your fantasies through
our bodies.” But somehow they are the victims.
TK

I have no words for that, I ­don’t. You just gave me an awareness when
you talked about pornotroping of why I ­can’t talk to white ­people about
how much they appreciate the film Moonlight and the work of Tarell
McCraney. I’m afraid about where the conversation w
­ ill go. How am I
­going to do it?

FW

This is what kills us, ­because it hurts you in your chest.

TK

I think my own anxiety as it concerns my own writing is that my academic and therefore writing work is something I cannot escape. For
my academic colleagues and, to some extent, if I am honest about how
I experience my work in the context of the acad­emy, my anxiety can
at times stem from ­whether I feel like I am appreciated enough. And
­we’re always ­doing a self-­assessment in terms of our marketability. I
­didn’t have to do this in the other kind of work I did before I became
an academic.

FW

It’s like we are never not working. Thanks for that, it spoke to something that was gnawing at me.

Part 2

When Frank and I spoke again ­later, it was in order to finish a conversation that
I felt was unfinished. I felt that very early on, I rerouted our conversation away
from the territory of Native subjectivity. My own apprehension surfaced and
prevented a full fleshing out of some of the more difficult terrain of Black
and Indigenous relations.
TK

Frank, thank you so much for being willing to speak with me again.
I ­really felt like I had to continue this conversation with you to ­really
allow you—­and me—­the opportunity to finish or rather open up some
­things. I am also putting my cards on the ­table, about how I come to
this conversation and where we left off last time. I think that in my
own work, I have tried to hold hope that Native and Black folks can
speak to each other. What I thought I found was an opening in Red,
White & Black. I was compelled by your idea of Black flesh and Indian
flesh—­Black flesh created out of slavery and Indian flesh created out
of genocide. And that Indigenous ­people in the genocidal mode could

talk to Black ­peoples as fungible, accumulable ­things. And when you
started to talk about Jared’s work, particularly, the “Vel of Slavery” [in
this collection] early in our first conversation as a corrective to your
work, I started to think, maybe I have to change my mind if Frank
changed his mind.8 I also have to be clear that I am currently in the
pro­cess of writing a book [The Black Shoals] that looks for ­these moments of discursive exchange or where we “hear” each other. I think
that trepidation made me stop the conversation prematurely. I prevented you and us from talking about how you have r­ eally sat with and
thought about Native studies and Native philosophies, Native cosmology and Native thought. So I wanted you to be able to think through
that this time.
FW

I want to say I share your anxiety at the level of emotion and the level
of intent. I also shared it theoretically when I wrote Red, White &
Black. Jared’s work had already been generative and formative for me.
He holds t­ hings very unflinchingly. He does not link an analy­sis of a
prob­lem with a prescription for how to solve the prob­lem. That’s the
heat that Afro-­pessimism gets b
­ ecause few p
­ eople are able or willing
to theorize like that. Matthew Arnold said in Culture and Anarchy that
the workers can and should become more enfranchised than the British aristocracy is willing to allow, and they and their ­children should
have f­ree access to education; but they should not be taught a mode
of thinking that could lead to a French Revolution in E
­ ngland. Arnold
wanted to keep both the working class and the aristocracy in check.
He was saying, “If we keep ­going down this road, the aristocracy, it’s
­going to drive E
­ ngland into the ground. We need a m
­ iddle ground but
it ­can’t be revolutionary.” And he thought educating the working class
while clipping the wings of the aristocracy would achieve this; but the
working class needed a pedagogy that shackled prob­lems to solutions
(description must always come with prescription); other­wise, they
would find the solutions in the streets—­and ­those solutions would
not contribute to the rise of capital and the ­middle class. “Sweetness
and light” must prevail over anarchy (from below and from above).
­Afro-pessimism does not come with a prescriptive component. No
answer to ­either Arnolds or Lenin’s, for that ­matter, question, “What is
to be done?” Black folks ­will figure that out when ­we’re on the move.
I was in gradu­ate school with Jared, and we ­were dealing with vari­ous
campaigns. One was a campaign to stop a proposition that would send

youth to state prisons. P
­ eople would say, if you are for prison abolition
as the long-­term goal on the path of the reformist campaign, how are
we ­going to stop crime? And I remember at one of t­ hese debates, Jared
said, I ­won’t talk to you about crime and punishment. I ­will only talk to
you about crime. At a l­ ater time, I w
­ ill talk about punishment. To have
that conversation together is to have a conversation about the solution.
Theoretically, we believe Black embodiment is a prob­lem that does
not have a coherent solution. (­We’re not simply being recalcitrant and
difficult.) One of the claims Sexton is making in the “Vel of Slavery,”
thanks to Native scholars, is that ­there is a distinction between colonialism and settler colonialism. It’s a power­ful intervention. But ­you’re
still talking the politics of a claim, the politics of redress, the politics
of dispossession. And that very conversation itself crowds out Black
suffering. I’ve come over to that b
­ ecause I think that even though in
2010 I theorized should Indigenous theorization of suffering jettison
sovereignty as an essential dynamic and stay in the ele­ments of genocide, I have found t­ here is just not enthusiasm among First P
­ eoples in
Canada and Native ­peoples in the US to follow that path. So just on the
level of on-­the-­ground activism, I just get hammered by ­people who
tell me to focus on the historical concrete t­ hing of Indian ­people having
lost land. So w
­ e’re not ­going to have a conversation of the abjection
of Blackness with the partial abjection of Nativeness. Th
­ ere is just no
desire. The book ­you’re ­doing could be a new chapter in that. I think
this structure of feeling is hegemonic, that no ­matter how good the
argument is, folks refuse to be authorized by a Black ensemble of questions. I ­don’t think it’s a calculated t­ hing. I just think that’s how Native
­peoples are like white ­people in the libidinal economy. I ­don’t have
time for ­these p
­ eople, that’s my attitude. Does that mean I d
­ on’t champion the release of Leonard Peltier? Does that mean I ­don’t champion
the destruction of the United States and the honoring of treaties and
more so that land is returned to Indians? No, I want ­those t­ hings. But
I also fundamentally ­don’t believe Black ­peoples have any co­ali­tion
partners—­not even with Native Americans or First Nations ­Peoples
in Canada. And this marks a shift in my thinking since Red, White
& Black. Even Native Americans, when in co­ali­tion with Blacks, are
­going to crowd out discussion of our grammar of suffering (and often
go so far as to lump us in with the settlers). H
­ ere’s another component
of this. Jared makes the point that what you get out of Blackness is a
politics without claim. And no one seems to be taking that on. Saidiya

Hartman said to me when I wrote my dissertation that I was ­going to
get all this flak ­because it (my critique of Indigenous ontology) is not
camouflaged. And she was right. Afro-­pessimism is not just an analy­
sis of the preconscious suffering that civil society imposes upon Black
­people—­the withholding of rights. It’s also about the collective unconscious and how the mind works creating Blackness as a necessary
object of abjection, through primary pro­cesses of articulation, not just
secondary processes—­how conscious speech belies primary desires.
You ­can’t control your unconsciousness. Jared has come along and
shown me that we embody an essential antagonism b
­ ecause you cannot articulate what would make Black p
­ eople w
­ hole. And that makes
every­one anxious. Let’s say we look up in the perfect world where Native p
­ eoples engage Afro-­pessimism. Blackness is the absence of subjectivity and that’s so power­ful. That’s why p
­ eople want Black p
­ eoples
in their movement. Why ­don’t Native ­people, instead of articulating
sovereignty as the key ­thing, why ­don’t they see that their grammar of
suffering, as horrifying as it is, is not as bad as the Black grammar of
suffering. Why do we have to be, in the face of the evidence, the number one subject of suffering? I d
­ on’t want to be the number one subject
of suffering, I would much rather be a disposed colonial subject than a
slave for whom ­there is no story of dispossession.
TK

Are you saying, why is it that in the face of Black suffering, the Native
person ­can’t say, wow, that’s not what I experience? And I d
­ on’t necessarily have to experience it. Is that what you are saying? You want Native ­people to be able to say, my suffering is horrible, but in the face of
Black suffering, and its politics without a claim or a demand, that is a
­whole dif­fer­ent order of existence that I am unfamiliar with?

FW

Id
­ on’t understand the question.

TK

I just wanted to be sure I heard you. You w
­ ere helping me think of the
anecdotes I use when I hold out this hope. I think I shared with you I
­ ere was this moment
used to be part of the incite chapter in Toronto. Th
when we as Black and Indigenous p
­ eople got each other. Th
­ ere ­were three
Black ­women that w
­ ere part of incite, and we sat with an Anishinaabe
­woman for two years trying to work this out. We ­were having deep
conversations about the prob­lems of sovereignty with our Anishinaabe
­sister. We w
­ ere saying, even this idea of getting rid of the Canadian state,
getting rid of the US, creating a new subjectivity, creating new language

systems, how do you account for Native p
­ eoples’ anti-­Blackness. And
one s­ ister asked the Anishinaabe ­sister directly, how can you guarantee
that Native p
­ eople ­won’t incarcerate and kill us like white p
­ eople do?
And the Anishinaabe ­woman sat back and was completely crestfallen,
and said, I never considered that in my understanding of sovereignty.
She said that she would have to shift. Her idea about sovereignty would
have to be about Black survival. We would have to undo the prison system in order to f­ ree the land. So we are back to the land.
So I have to check myself ­here, ­because I’m sure I d
­ on’t have a full
understanding about what Native p
­ eoples mean by land. I think in
Black studies we tend to be reductive about land. But what I hear Jared
say is that Native ­peoples ­will still ground themselves in a kind of coherence. So even if she says I ­will rethink or undo sovereignty, she
still has land to fall back on, which has a par­tic­u­lar kind of coherence
with the h
­ uman and the self, particularly for white folks. As you w
­ ere
talking, it helped me think about t­ hose experiences I had with INCITE.
­Because ­there we ­were with Black and Native flesh. We ­weren’t where
Jared is, but we ­were willing to move in light of Black suffering. Again,
you said ­people often come to us with emotional, experiential examples. It makes me consider w
­ hether t­ hese experiences can lead to long-­
term transformation? In the end, we de­cided to put our work together
on hold. We w
­ ere at an impasse. We still want to hold one another and
Black and Indigenous ­people but do not know how to move forward.
FW

I agree with every­thing you are saying, you said it all.

TK

But let us get back to what you ­didn’t get a chance to talk about. Why
did you choose to think with Ward Churchill, Vine Deloria, Leslie
Marmon Silko, ­etc., in your book? Was ­there something about what
they ­were saying that allowed you a point of entry?

FW

First, let me say I am not someone who cares about ­whether Churchill
is a properly registered Cherokee, and hence would say he is not worth
listening to, like this Hawaiian scholar, J. Kēhaulani Kauanui, was saying to me at this talk.

TK

I just saw a chronicling of your and Kauanui’s exchange in a recent
American Quarterly article.9

FW

Look, in general, when I travel it’s to connect with other Black p
­ eople
and have a space to think about Black suffering. I d

can be taught to accept the essential dynamic of Black suffering. I
simply believe the psyche has pro­cesses that are contradictory and
hypocritical. I think Blackness necessarily remains in the realm of
the imaginary. I believe ­there is a structural imposition that prevents
bringing Blackness into subjectivity. I used to try to work with that.
Now I try to have a way of talking that is a meta­phorical m
­ iddle fin­
ger. That energy makes Black ­people feel good about my talk. I feel
good about centering ­peoples who have been genocided at the level of
analy­sis. Can you restate the question again?
TK

No, I like where we ­were g­ oing. I was reading that article a few days
ago, and I had a lot of prob­lems with it. First, I found J. Kēhualani
Kauanui uncritical of Patrick Wolfe. Secondly, she said that you said
“­we’re not ­going to agree.” Which is true. But I felt like we ­were not
­going to get anywhere in the article. But her beef is in­ter­est­ing. In her
argument she uses Bacon’s Rebellion to argue that ­people who ­were
in the pro­cess of becoming Black, but not in the way we know Blackness ­today, chose to participate in Native genocide. She dismisses your
question of why are you so focused on Black p
­ eople’s role in the assault on Native ­people? She just says Black ­peoples have subjectivity
and can do vio­lence to Native folks. Now she brought this up, but it
makes me think of the unconscious, and how it might be working in
terms of her focus. In the article, she says the Occoneechees sold out
the Susquehannock as they sought a strategic alliance with the participants of the rebellion. So my question is, why d
­ oesn’t she have an issue
with the Occoneechees who w
­ ere also complicit in the genocide of the
Susquehannock? Why are you only concerned about Black folks’ (who
­were not yet Black in the way we know) complicity and not about how
one nation of Indigenous p
­ eople participated in the genocide of another nation?

FW

Exactly, she was one of ­those p
­ eople who said Churchill ­isn’t even Native as a way to dismiss my argument. She ­didn’t know how the libidinal
economy is subtended by vio­lence. How the collective unconsciousness works with structural vio­lence. You know what, in 1997, I d
­ idn’t
­either. I had to go through psychoanalysis. Then I had to go through
how psychoanalysis is as anti-­Black as is Marxism. This is the drive of
Black liberation, which is dif­fer­ent than the drive of Indigenous liberation. What I was arguing in my books is that world-­making is an
anti-­Black proj­ect. I ­don’t like that statement. It gives me a lot of pain.

However, my pain is not a c­ ounter argument. If anything, it gives the
(painful) argument more validity. But she was arguing several layers
below the level of abstraction at which I was speaking. She was saying
this is how our world was destroyed and this is how Black ­people participated in the destruction of our world. And my argument is that you
first talk to me about how the world is made? How is space transposed
into place and how does paradigmatic vio­lence play into that? And
Black ­people are always making place out of space and making event out
of duration. But the structure of gratuitous vio­lence acts as an injunction
against anyone e­ lse accepting Black place names or Black timed events.
Native p
­ eoples are told that their world is incompatible with the Eu­ro­
pean world. But ­we’re told we have no right to make or inhabit worlds
at all (­whether Native or Eu­ro­pean). I realized that her unconscious
anti-­Blackness was not giving me any authority at the level of theory;
not b
­ ecause she disagreed with me but b
­ ecause she had nothing to say
about the ­actual Afro-pessimist argument; and every­thing to say about
the historical facticity of Black participation in Native subjugation. She
was keeping herself from being able to understand that I was not saying
that Black p
­ eople have never committed horrible crimes against Native
­peoples. But I was saying that I dealt with that in my discussion of Vine
Deloria complaining about Black Buffalo Soldiers and Black p
­ eople becoming Christians. Vine Deloria did not understand that slavery is not
about Black ­people picking cotton and being in chains: that’s the historical facticity of some experiences of slavery, not a paradigmatic explanation of slavery. Slavery is a dynamic in which subjectivity cannot cohere.
She could have said, “Hey buddy your meta-­critique of relationality is
wrong and h
­ ere is how relationality is not anti-­Black; I’ll explain how
Indigenous world making is not anti-­Black.” That would have been a
genuine response to my talk. But she ­didn’t meet me ­there. She stayed
at her level of scholarship, and the historical dynamic. That’s a trap. One
which I simply refuse to fall into. And that’s what happened. Some Black
­people came up, and said, “That’s what I was thinking but ­didn’t know if
I could say it.” And that’s all I care about. Not ­because I’m a jerk, ­because
I am a jerk, but b
­ ecause she ­didn’t actually engage what my book said or
what I said in my lecture.
Now coming to back to the original question, what I realized was
that the Native writers ­were reluctant to have a sustained engagement with vio­lence. But Black writers ­were not reluctant. But Silko,
Churchill, and [Haunani-­Kay] Trask had the sustained engagement

with vio­lence, even though the tools they ­were using ­were from the
social sciences. I wanted to see if ­there ­were Native ­peoples talking
about vio­lence compared to culture.
TK

I am trying to have conversations with Native studies scholars about
my more recent analytical shifts. I’m ready to talk about conquest,
but not about settler colonialism. I c­ an’t ­really have this conversation
about language, culture, spiritual laws, and land. But I can talk about
the brutal ways conquest created the h
­ uman through Black and Indigenous death. Some folks can hear it and some cannot. Some ­can’t hear
my beef with Patrick Wolfe. Like OK, ­we’ve traveled with his idea that
settlement and invasion are a “structure and not an event,” but we c­ an’t
keep ­going ­there ­because eventually y­ ou’re ­going to be talking about
the ­human space, ­labor, and work. Something—­a discourse—­within
which Black ­people cannot be heard. Some Indigenous p
­ eoples ­don’t
want to have a conversation on Black terms.

FW

I have a tendency to be flippant. I’m still willing to have the conversation. I’ve spent my teens in the ’70s when I was an internationalist, and
my twenties and thirties in South Africa, and the forties in grad school,
­really wanting this embrace between Black and Native p
­ eoples. I would
like that. I still think ­there is an injunction against it. But I want it.

TK

I ­don’t think you are being flippant. You have put the time into that.
You ­were sharing that you grew up in Minnesota and knew p
­ eople in
aim. For most of my po­liti­cal life, I have only worked with Black folks,
and ­didn’t come into any consciousness about Indigenous genocide
­until my thirties. So when I was in Toronto in 2006 I was hit with
it. A consciousness about Indigenous genocide is much more present there than on the East Coast in the US. I mean it’s in the atmosphere. You can feel it. The very presence of Native activists in the
streets of ­Toronto representing for the Six Nations encampment and
blockade in Caledonia was right in my face. I was also confronting
this issue with my Anishinaabe friend who was working with Native
youth whose rates of suicide were astonishingly high at the time. She
was constantly trying to prevent the death of Native youth and working with the Murdered and Missing Indigenous ­women movement. So
I was horrified about genocide and that she was working with Native
death ­every day, but also about my ignorance of it. I felt guilty, and so
I am still invested in kind of letting the real­ity of genocide hit me and

work through it. So I know I’m in a dif­fer­ent place than where you are,
where you are—­you are, exhausted—­you’ve been arguing with folks for
de­cades that still h
­ aven’t moved. So I ­don’t think y­ ou’re being flip.
FW

I ­don’t want to in any way belittle the tactile suffering of Native ­peoples.
I’ve spoken twice in Toronto and once in London [Ontario]—an hour
from ­there. What I felt in the room, Native p
­ eople ­were guilt-­tripping
Black p
­ eoples into not being enough into Native issues. But the biggest example was when I was with Jared and the now deceased Joel
Olson, who does whiteness studies. Th
­ ere was this radical whiteness
conference in Denver. They brought us to speak and aim ­people to
speak. I suggested to them that Zakiyyah Jackson speak since they
­didn’t have any Black ­women speaking. The first year, the organizers
­were ­really into the analytic framework that Ward Churchill was offering, which was very power­ful at the time. One reason I got fired
from UC Santa Cruz was trying to get him to speak t­ here. The second
year (in Denver)—­and this is the danger of the white gaze—­the white
organizers would read more work by Black intellectuals than Native
intellectuals. The work we w
­ ere ­doing was showing how vio­lence was
part of the libidinal economy. The Native ­people w
­ ere ­really upset. Zakiyyah was the next to the last speaker and Ward Churchill was the last
speaker. I worshipped him as a theorist at the time, but he did not sit
through any of the Black talks. And, ­toward the end of the conference,
he and his entourage ­were very abusive to Zakiyyah Jackson while she
was at the podium. He came in with his uniformed bodyguards (aim
paramilitary gear), four of them, and he sends his uniformed bodyguards on the stage while she was talking; and they ran ­behind her,
again, while she was speaking, and said it was a security check. (In
other words, this pageantry was, putatively, about a Secret Service–­like
security check—­never mind the fact that a Black w
­ oman was speaking on the stage that they needed to secure—­before Churchill spoke,
to prevent assassination attempts). ­After that, I was just through with
him. Why did they do it? They w
­ ere tired of her talk bleeding through
the time he thought he should be speaking. We (Churchill and I) got
into a heated repartee on what had happened. On top of that, unlike
Jackson, Churchill ­didn’t even come prepared. He spoke extemporaneously. I just left. He told the organizers that he wanted to meet me
to talk about what happened. (I guess some kind of rapprochement
with me, not Jackson; he made no overtures t­oward her, nor did his

­ eople.) His ­people told me he wanted the two of us to meet up the
p
next day. And I d
­ idn’t do that. I’m through with him as a politico. I’m
not through with him as a theoretician. And the reason I’m done with
him as a politico has nothing to do with ­whether he has the proper
papers from the Cherokee Nation. That’s just a moment of madness
like so many ­others.
TK

So when ­you’re talking about your travels in Canada, this anxiety that
Black p
­ eople have about not being down with Indigenous p
­ eoples is
deep to me. Black p
­ eople in Canada are always thinking about Indigenous genocide, even in a context where t­ here are no Black studies programs. But I ­don’t know how many Indigenous folks have showed up to
get Black studies in Canadian universities. That kind of anxiety has always been weird to me given the kind of leverage Indigenous p
­ eoples actually do have in Canada. In a 2006 conference, ­there was discussion on
Blackness, Indigeneity, and diaspora. Then in a moment of frustration, a
Mi’kmaq scholar called Black ­peoples settlers. Then the white ­people in
the audience ­were laughing and saying she was right. I thought, how is
this even pos­si­ble? What have you been reading that Black p
­ eople could
ever share the same ontological position as white settlers?

FW

When it comes down to it, we as Black ­peoples have the generosity
to understand the grammar of suffering of o
­ thers, but ­there’s no generosity coming back to us. It’s always what we have to be taught, and
not what we can teach ­others. That lack of engagement works at ­every
level of abstraction—at the level of the interpersonal, the institutional,
­etc., and the level of the imaginary of Native society once liberated. In
some way, in dif­fer­ent modalities, every­one is like Abraham Lincoln
who said Blacks should be ­free but I ­can’t imagine them living with us.

TK

Thank you so much for your time, Frank.

FW

I’m glad you are d
­ oing this work. I d
­ on’t think the work you, Jared, or
I are ­doing ­will change Native p
­ eoples’ minds. But I think it w
­ ill give
Black ­people permission to speak the unspeakable. And that’s what is
impor­tant.
