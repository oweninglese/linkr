ABSTRACT. In 1905 and 1906, the Cree of the southwestern James Bay region signed Treaty No. 9 whereby they relinquished

to the Canadian government their claim to the lands south of the Albany River (the northern boundary of the province of
Ontario at the time). The official text of Treaty No. 9 made no mention of land submerged below water cover, and thus the Cree
did not relinquish such regions at that time. By contrast, the Cree of the northwestern James Bay and southwestern Hudson Bay

region who signed the 1929-30 Adhesions to Treaty No. 9 relinquished their claims to "land covered by water" for the area
bounded on the south by the northerly limit of Treaty No. 9, as this clause was specifically included in the text of the adhesion.

The issue of "land covered by water" is significant because the western James Bay region has been, and will continue to be,
subject to sea level changes associated with ongoing adjustments due to the last ice age and modern global warming signals.

In the absence of detailed maps, we used models of these processes, constrained by available geophysical and geodetic data
sets, to retrodict shoreline changes and the rate of land emergence over the last two centuries within the boundaries specified

by Treaty No. 9. We also project shoreline migration to the end of the 21st century within the same region. The rate of land

emergence since 1905 in the area south of the Albany River is estimated as -3.0 km2/yr. Over the next century, land will

continue to emerge in this region at a mean rate of -1.4 km2/yr. This emergent land should be a subject of consideration within

any comprehensive land claim put forward by the Cree; in this regard, it will be interesting to see how the Canadian judicial
system and the Comprehensive Claims Branch handle the novel issue of emergent land.

RÉSUMÉ. En 1905 et 1906, les Cris du sud-ouest de la région de la baie James ont signé le Traité n° 9, par le biais duquel ils
ont cédé au gouvernement du Canada leur droit de revendication des terres au sud de la rivière Albany (la limite nord de la
province de l'Ontario à l'époque). Le texte officiel du Traité n° 9 ne faisait aucune mention des terres submergées sous l'eau,

si bien que les Cris n'ont pas renoncé à ces régions à ce moment-là. En revanche, les Cris du nord-ouest de la baie James et
du sud-ouest de la baie d'Hudson qui ont signé les adhésions au Traité n° 9 (1929-1930) ont renoncé à leurs revendications

aux « terres recouvertes d'eau » dans la zone délimitée au sud par la limite nord du Traité n° 9, puisque cette clause était
expressément incluse dans le texte de l'adhésion. La question des « terres recouvertes d'eau » est importante parce que l'ouest

de la région de la baie James a été et continuera d'être assujettie aux variations du niveau de la mer liées aux ajustements
continus découlant de la dernière période glaciaire et des récents signes de réchauffement planétaire. En l'absence de cartes
détaillées, nous avons utilisé des modèles de ces processus, limités par les ensembles de données géophysiques et géodésiques
disponibles, pour déterminer de façon rétrospective les changements du littoral et le taux d'émergence des terres au cours
des deux derniers siècles dans les limites précisées dans le Traité n° 9. Nous faisons également une projection de la migration

du littoral jusqu'à la fin du XXIe siècle dans cette même région. Le taux d'émergence des terres depuis 1905 dans la région
au sud de la rivière Albany est estimé à -3,0 km2/année. Au cours du prochain siècle, les terres continueront d'émerger dans

cette région au taux moyen de -1,4 km2/année. Ces terres émergées devraient être prises en compte dans toute revendication

territoriale globale présentée par les Cris. À cet égard, il sera intéressant de voir comment le système judiciaire canadien et la
Direction générale des revendications globales traiteront cette nouvelle question des terres émergées.

INTRODUCTION

A "blanket" land clause that was standard procedure for
most of the previous numbered treaties (e.g., Treaty No. 4,
1874; Treaty No. 8, 1899) was also included in Treaty No. 9.

At confederation in 1867, the Province of Canada was
divided into the provinces of Ontario and Quebec; these This land clause read as follows:

The earth is currently in an interglacial period, yet the

Specifically, this region, which was once covered by an ice

rebound of the solid crust at rates of approximately 1 cm/yr

(Mitrovica et al., 2000). This postglacial rebound gives rise
to a land emergence, or alternatively a sea level fall, that
is accompanied by shoreline migration. This migration has
been active since the region became ice-free and is responsible for the raised late Holocene beach terraces that perof f HUDSON y

this period (Church and White, 2011), but this sea level
