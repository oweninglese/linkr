ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES: Aboriginal peoples affected by a nutrition transition and living at high latitudes are among the ethnic groups most at risk of vitamin D
deficiency. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of meeting predefined cut-off concentrations of vitamin D and to examine
associated factors among James Bay Cree aged ≥15 years.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between the months of May and September from 2005 to 2009. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D) concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Anthropometrics were measured and additional information on socio-demographic
characteristics, lifestyle and dietary habits was obtained using questionnaires. A logistic regression model predicting vitamin D insufficiency (<50 nmol/L)
included known covariates.
RESULTS: Data were obtained from 944 Cree (406 men (43%); mean age 37.4 years), with an effective participation rate of 49% among women and
41% among men. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations (nmol/L) by gender were 52.9 (95% CI 51.4-54.5) in men and 47.5 (95% CI 46.2-48.9) in
women, and by age group were 46.0 (95% CI 44.9-48.9) in those 15-39 years and 59.6 (95% CI 57.9-61.4) in those ≥40 years of age. Overall, 5.8%,
42.6%, 40.0%, and 11.7% of the participants had 25(OH)D concentrations <30, 30-49.9, 50-74.9 and ≥75 nmol/L, respectively. Female gender,
obesity, younger age, spring, low fish and milk intake, and low vigorous physical activity predicted vitamin D insufficiency (all p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: The vitamin D status in Eastern James Bay Cree is suboptimal with nearly half of the population having insufficient concentrations for
optimum bone health.

lthough there is currently much debate over optimal vitamin D concentrations for overall health, the Institute of
Medicine (2011) report established reference levels for bone
health, as follows: risk of deficiency defined as a serum concentration below 30 nmol/L and insufficiency for bone health as below
50 nmol/L.1 Very little is known about the vitamin D status of
Indigenous peoples,2-4 including the Cree of Eastern James Bay. A
small Canadian study (n=356) reported lower mean serum
25(OH)D concentrations and a higher prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in rural and urban Aboriginal women living in Manitoba
(49°-50° N) compared to non-Aboriginal women.5 Moreover, the
prevalence of vitamin D concentrations <37.5 nmol/L was previously reported to be 20% in James Bay (mean latitude 51º N) Cree
≥18 years of age without diabetes.6
Vitamin D exists in two forms: vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) found
in plants and fungi, and vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) from the sun.7
The cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 depends on environmental
factors (geographic location/latitude, atmospheric conditions, and
season), behavioural factors (time spent outdoors, clothing, and
use of sunscreen) as well as physiologic factors (age and skin
type).3,8,9 Exogenous vitamin D can be obtained from supplements,
fatty fish, and fortified foods such as milk and margarine.10 Plasma
concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is the best available clinical indicator of vitamin D status reflecting diet, supplements and sun exposure.9,11,12

The Cree of Eastern James Bay live among nine communities located between the 49th and the 55th parallel, where we would expect minimal or no vitamin D cutaneous synthesis for five to six months of the
year.13,14 Historically known as subsistence hunters, the Cree have
adapted their traditional diet to Euro-American culture.15,16 We
hypothesized that the James Bay Cree affected by a nutrition transition and living at high latitudes have a high risk of vitamin D insufficiency. The purpose of this study was to examine 25(OH)D
concentrations and factors known to influence their vitamin D status.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS
Data for these analyses are from the Nituuchischaayihtitaau Aschii:
A Multi-Community Environment and Health Longitudinal Study
in James Bay Cree communities. The rationale and methods of this
study have been previously reported.6,17 Ethics approval was
obtained from participating universities. Study participants provided informed written consent in Cree or in English.
The data were collected between May and September of each year
from 2005 to 2009. Eligible participants were aged ≥15 years and
lived in 7 of the 9 Eastern James Bay Cree communities (49º-55º N)
at the time of the study. Questionnaires to assess dietary patterns
and lifestyle habits were administered by trained bilingual local
interviewers. Intake of vitamin D from diet and from supplements
was obtained from a 24-hour recall. Data from direct measurement
of height (stadiometer), body weight and body fat mass (Tanita TBF300) were recorded. Plasma samples taken by a research nurse were
collected under fasting conditions and used to measure a variety
of biological parameters, including 25(OH)D. Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were determined by competitive radioimmunoassay
using the IDS RIA kit (Medicorp Inc., Montreal). The samples kept
in a freezer at ≤-80°C were run at different times and by community.

Sampling plan
The study population originated from sampling of community beneficiary lists. Stratified sampling, with proportional allocation to
stratum size, was considered to ensure adequate representation for

each age-stratum group. In order to account for complex survey
design, we calculated weights based on the probability of selection
within the age-stratum of interest (15-39 and ≥40), the nonresponse rate and the post-stratification adjustments by age group
and sex to adjust the sample to the Cree population.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.2. We measured the proportion of the population meeting
predefined cut-points of serum 25(OH)D concentrations:12 deficiency, <30 nmol/L; insufficiency, <50.0 nmol/L; and optimal,
≥75.0 nmol/L. Confidence intervals were calculated around weighted prevalence estimates. Serum 25(OH)D was not normally distributed and geometric means were reported. Student t-tests were
performed to test geometric mean differences of serum 25(OH)D
by levels of covariates. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Multiple logistic regression investigated predictors of vitamin D
insufficiency (serum 25(OH)D <50 nmol/L). Covariates included
age, gender, body mass index (BMI), frequency of fish intake weekly, frequency of milk intake daily, physical activity, smoking history, season, education, alcohol consumption, and vitamin D intake.
Menopausal status and breastfeeding status were also considered
for women. Tests for interactions of season on physical activity and
on fish intake were performed. We excluded participants with missing values for covariates in regression analyses. The goodness-of-fit
of a model was assessed using the Hosmer-and-Lemeshow test.

* Factors that were not predictive of vitamin D insufficiency included education level, vitamin D intake from 24-hour recall, physical activity (walking), alcohol

Goodness-of-fit according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test: full model: p=0.435; 15-39 years: p=0.956; ≥40 years: p=0.659.
† h/d = hour per day.

RESULTS
Of the 1,405 participants, baseline information and serum 25(OH)D
concentrations were available for 944 eligible Cree aged 15 to 91
years (43% men). The effective participation rate, taking into
account participation in the survey and the proportion of the survey participants who had the serum 25(OH)D test, was 49% among
women and 41% among men. The prevalence of obesity (BMI≥30)
in this sample was 67.1%.
Weighted geometric mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations by gender were 52.9 nmol/L (95% CI 51.4-54.5) in men and 47.5 nmol/L
(95% CI 46.2-48.9) in women, and by age group were 46.0 nmol/L
(95% CI 44.9-48.9) in those aged 15 to 39 years and 59.6 (95% CI
57.9-61.4) in those aged ≥40 years (Table 1). Mean serum 25(OH)D
concentrations also differed (p<0.05) by BMI classification, smoking history, frequency of fish consumption, vigorous physical activity level, education level, type of community (inland vs. coastal)
and by month of blood collection (Table 1).
Overall, the estimated prevalence of vitamin D deficiency
(<30 nmol/L) was 5.7% (Table 2). In women, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 20.0% in adolescents aged 15 to 19 years and
progressively decreased in older age groups. In men, 8.9% of adolescents 15 to 19 years and 1.7% of young adults 20-39 years were
vitamin D deficient. No cases of deficiency were observed in the
≥40 age-stratum for men and in the ≥60 age-stratum for women.
(Supplementary Figures 1-3 illustrate the weighted prevalence esti-

mates (and 95% CIs) of the study population meeting selected vitamin D cut-off, by age group and gender.)
The proportion of the Cree population with sufficient vitamin
D concentrations (≥50 nmol/L) was 51.6%, leaving nearly half with
concentrations inadequate for bone health (vitamin D insufficiency <50 nmol/L). The prevalence of insufficiency was highest in
those aged 15 to 19 years in both women and men (78.7% and
65.1%, respectively) and decreased progressively in the 20-39 year
age group (66.8% and 44.6, respectively) and in the 40-59 year age
group (36.0% and 20.4%, respectively). Older individuals
(≥60 years) had the lowest prevalence of insufficiency in both
women and men (20.4% and 14.8%, respectively).
Only 11.7% of Cree aged 15 to 91 years had circulating 25(OH)D
concentrations equal to or above the 75 nmol/L proposed cut-off
for optimal health and prevention of disease. In those aged 15 to
39 years, optimal levels were observed in 6.3% of the sample, as
compared to 22.4% in those ≥40 years.
Significant predictors of vitamin D insufficiency are summarized
in Table 3. In the full model, female gender (OR 1.75, CI 1.28-2.38),
younger age (OR 0.94, CI 0.92-0.95), and being obese (BMI≥30)
(OR 1.80, CI 1.29-2.49) were associated with an increase in the odds of
having serum 25(OH)D concentration <50.0 nmol/L (insufficiency). Also, samples collected in summer (OR 0.42, CI 0.30-0.58), eating fish once a week or more (OR 0.54, CI 0.36-0.80), drinking milk

VITAMIN D STATUS OF CANADIAN ABORIGINALS

>1 hour/day of vigorous physical activity (OR 0.49, CI 0.34-0.71)
were independently associated with a decrease in the odds of vitamin D insufficiency. Vitamin D intake from 24-hour recall, education level, physical activity (walking), alcohol consumption, type of
community, and smoking status were not predictive of vitamin D
insufficiency.
The effect of age was weaker in those aged 40 years and over as
compared to younger individuals. Physical activity and frequency
of fish and milk intake were significant determinants of vitamin D
sufficiency in the 15 to 39 year age group only. Also, being obese
had a larger negative effect on vitamin D status in those aged
40 years and over than in the younger Cree.

DISCUSSION
We investigated the vitamin D status and associated factors in the
Cree of Eastern James Bay, including age, BMI, milk and fish consumption, and physical activity. A cross-sectional analysis using
data from the largest comprehensive Aboriginal health survey to
date to assess serum 25(OH)D, and the first focused on the Cree of
Eastern James Bay, showed that mean concentrations measured
from May to September were relatively low.
The mean 25(OH)D concentrations observed in Eastern James
Bay Cree are generally lower than what is reported in the literature.
The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) reported mean
25(OH)D from April to October of 70.0 nmol/L, which is considerably higher than that reported in our study. The CHMS survey
assessed the vitamin D status in a nationally representative sample
of 5,306 Canadians (43°-52° N) aged 6-79 years.4 Smaller studies
found mixed results. A cross-sectional study of 153 Caucasian
women of reproductive age (latitude 45° N) revealed mean concentrations of 88.4 nmol/L between May and July.18 Similarly,
Genuis et al. reported mean concentrations of 68.3 nmol/L in
1,433 patients living in Edmonton, Canada (approx. 53° N), including
First Nations. Of the study participants, they found that First
Nations and those with darker skin were most likely to have low
25(OH)D concentrations.19 In contrast, Weiler et al. compared rural
and urban Aboriginal women living in Manitoba (approx. 50° N)
and reported concentrations of 41.8 and 53.8 nmol/L, respectively, thus suggesting that Aboriginal women, especially those living
in rural areas, have lower blood concentrations of vitamin D than
non-Aboriginals.5
Concentrations below 30 nmol/L are considered to be associated with increased risk of osteomalacia/osteoporosis in adulthood.
Our findings suggest that vitamin D deficiency is relatively rare in
middle-aged/senior individuals who participated in this study.
However, the proportion of female adolescents (20%) and young
adult women (10.8%) at risk of vitamin D deficiency is considerably
higher than what is reported in Canada (approximately 4% for
women aged 6 to 79 years).14 Similarly, only 51.6% of Quebec Cree
met the 50 nmol/L cut-off for sufficiency, where concentrations of
serum 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L are considered to be insufficient
for bone health by the IOM standards.1 Our results are consistent
with other studies performed in northern countries that found a
high prevalence of serum 25(OH)D below 50 nmol/L.5,19-21
The high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency in Cree (49.4%)
is of concern. Comparable findings from the general Canadian population report prevalence between 20% and 35%.14 As suggested by
our results, Cree participants aged 15 to 39 years were most at risk

of both a vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, especially among
women. Because studies have previously reported that maternal
vitamin D insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of
gestational diabetes and short- and long-term consequences for the
offspring,22-25 consideration of vitamin D supplementation is warranted in Cree women of reproductive age.
The decrease in the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 as age
increases is well documented.26,27 In contrast, our results show that
Cree aged ≥40 years had an improved vitamin D status, with very
few deficient cases, a lower prevalence of insufficiency, and a higher prevalence of optimal concentrations. Using the same age groupings as the CHMS, we also observed a progressive increase in the
prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency, where those aged 15 to 19
years are at the higher risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency as compared to their older counterparts. Published findings
on the effects of age on serum 25(OH)D concentrations are mixed.
We observed that regardless of fish intake, milk intake, gender, BMI
and month of blood collection, increasing age was consistently
associated with higher levels of 25(OH)D. Langlois et al. reported a
U-shaped relationship; while children aged 6 to 11 years and seniors aged 60 to 79 years were most likely to be above the adequacy
cut-offs, lowest concentrations were observed at ages 20 to 39
years.4 In relation to age, our findings may in part be explained by
the complex nutrition transition affecting Aboriginal peoples of
Canada. It has been reported that Cree children consume less traditional food than adults, who in turn consume less traditional
food than elders.28 Accordingly, data obtained from a food frequency questionnaire adapted to reflect consumption of traditional foods indicated that fish intake varied according to the age
group. Fish intake among subjects 60 years and over was more than
five times that of the 15-39 year and over twice that of the 40-59
year age group. In addition to traditional food consumption, it is
suspected that traditional lifestyle, including more outdoor activities, may also vary with age and affect the vitamin D status of the
older population. We also noted that physical activity and dietary
patterns of vitamin D rich foods had a greater impact on vitamin
D status among the younger population. Thus, it is possible then
that traditional lifestyle, via higher fish intake and increased physical activity, represents a cultural adaptation of this people with
respect to vitamin D. This is especially evident in the results stratified by age-groupings, where older Cree – known to consume more
fish and take part in more traditional activities (hunting, fishing,
and gathering) – have much higher vitamin D levels.
There are mixed findings from published studies regarding a gender effect on 25(OH)D concentrations. In our study, women were
at much greater risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency than
men. In contrast, Whiting et al. reported a lower prevalence of
25(OH)D concentrations below 30 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L in nonWhite women as compared to non-White men, suggesting that
men are more at risk of a deficiency/insufficiency. We also explored
whether breastfeeding and post-menopausal status could influence
our results. In participating women who reported that they were
breastfeeding, the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency was comparable to the prevalence reported here. Similarly, the vitamin D
status was not affected by menopausal status. Further, we noted
that two out of three Cree participants were obese according to
standard BMI classification. Cross-sectional and evaluative studies
have previously reported evidence to support the hypothesis that

higher fat stores sequester vitamin D in adipose tissue, thus decreasing bioavailability.29-31 In this study and in a previous study based
on a subset of these data, serum 25(OH)D concentrations decreased
with increasing BMI, although the strength of the association was
less elsewhere in the literature.6,29
One important limitation of our study was the lack of data on
sun exposure (outdoor activities, use of protective clothing and sunscreen) which is believed to contribute to a large proportion of the
25(OH)D concentrations in the blood. Also, although the 24-hour
dietary recall assessment provided an estimate of vitamin D supplement use, the usual intakes of supplements would have been
better assessed through a question on the food frequency questionnaire. Moreover, although 25(OH)D is fairly representative of
vitamin D status, a single measure does not reflect long-term serum
25(OH)D and weakens our ability to interpret the results.32
Measurement errors may have been introduced by acute exposure
(travel south, supplementation and season) and these can be prevented by multiple sampling (e.g., sampling at different seasons)
of 25(OH)D and associated factors. Further, there is a possibility for
additional and residual confounding, most notably from the
dichotomization of many variables and from the assessment of
physical activity and dietary intake from self-reports. Finally,
because Eastern James Bay Cree are an ethnic minority, our findings
may have limited generalizability to the general population of
Canada. The generalizability of results is further compromised by
the 49% and 41% participation rate in women and men, respectively.

CONCLUSION
While vitamin D deficiency was low in the northern Quebec Cree
population, vitamin D insufficiency was common, especially
among women of reproductive age. Given that vitamin D insufficiency has been associated with an increasing number of conditions, including gestational diabetes,33 preeclampsia,34 osteoporosis
and cancer,35 it is essential that health professionals be informed
in order to provide the necessary dietary counselling or other interventions at the population level to prevent the nutrition transition. Regarding the young to middle-aged Cree, these findings
especially support the potential benefits of such interventions,
including those to promote physical activity and traditional and
high-quality non-traditional food choices.

VITAMIN D STATUS OF CANADIAN ABORIGINALS

RÉSUMÉ
OBJECTIFS : Les Autochtones en transition nutritionnelle qui vivent sous
les latitudes élevées sont parmi les groupes ethniques les plus à risque de
carences en vitamine D. Nous avons voulu déterminer la prévalence du
respect des concentrations-limites prédéfinies en vitamine D et examiner
les facteurs associés chez les Cris de la baie James âgés de ≥15 ans.
MÉTHODE : Nous avons mené une étude transversale entre les mois de
mai et de septembre de 2005 à 2009. Les concentrations sériques de 25hydroxyvitamine D (25-OH-D) ont été mesurées par radio-immuno-essai.
Nous avons pris des mesures anthropométriques et obtenu de
l’information supplémentaire sur les caractéristiques
sociodémographiques, le mode de vie et les habitudes alimentaires à
l’aide de questionnaires. Un modèle de régression logistique prédisant
l’insuffisance en vitamine D (<50 nmol/L) englobait les covariables
connues.
RÉSULTATS : Nous avons recueilli des données auprès de 944 Cris
(406 hommes (43 %); âge moyen de 37,4 ans) avec un taux de
participation réel de 49 % chez les femmes et de 41 % chez les hommes.
Les concentrations sériques moyennes de 25-OH-D (nmol/L) selon le sexe
étaient de 52,9 (IC de 95 % 51,4-54,5) chez les hommes et de 47,5
(IC de 95 % 46,2-48,9) chez les femmes; par groupe d’âge, elles étaient
de 46,0 (IC de 95 % 44,9-48,9) chez les 15-39 ans et de 59,6 (IC de 95 %
57,9-61,4) chez les ≥40 ans. Globalement, 5,8 %, 42,6 %, 40,0 % et
11,7 % des participants avaient des concentrations de 25-OH-D <30,
30-49,9, 50-74,9 et ≥75 nmol/L, respectivement. Le sexe féminin,
l’obésité, la jeunesse, le printemps, les faibles apports en poisson et en lait
et les faibles taux d’activité physique vigoureuse étaient des prédicteurs
de carence en vitamine D (p<0,05 dans tous les cas).
CONCLUSIONS : Le statut en vitamine D des Cris de l’Est de la baie
James est sous-optimal; près de la moitié de la population en possède des
concentrations insuffisantes à une santé osseuse optimale.
MOTS CLÉS : vitamine D; carence en vitamine D; prévalence; population
d’origine amérindienne
