CW: Sexual Assault, Murder, Ethnic Conflict
 
Since November, Ethiopian federal and allied military forces have carried out a 
genocidal campaign of political repression in the Tigray region. Indiscriminate 
bombings, mass executions, rape as a tool of war. Food supplies devastated 
adding starvation to the arsenal. Refugees are prevented from fleeing these 
horrors. Communications and outside aid have been cut off.

news, despite the information blackout. 
 
Outside the region, Tigrayan people have faced escalating discrimination and 
violence due to their ethnicity. They have lost jobs and had passports canceled.
Social media is filled with a cocktail of propaganda standard for modern 
genocidal regimes: open government hate propaganda mixes cleanly with legions of
unquestioning supporters and puppet account networks.
 
Responding to calls from Tigrayans and other groups facing violent repression 
from the Ethiopian state, a decentralized, global effort is underway to stop 
this genocidal conflict. This means building real solidarity, beyond borders and
nations.
 
We must also dismantle the Ethiopian state’s ability to wage this war. One way 
is to cut into the state’s biggest source of direct funding and foreign currency
revenue: coffee. A major buyer around the globe is Starbucks. The corporation 
regularly engages in direct negotiations with the Ethiopian state, whose direct 
control of trademark licensing and access to markets puts millions into the 
government’s coffers. Those in solidarity around the world must take action to 
cut off this flow while the genocide continues.

A History of Empire
 
Tigrayan people are not the first to face intense repression within Ethiopia’s 
empire. The borders of modern Ethiopia are home to dozens of indigenous groups. 
The formation of central states over thousands of years has brought conflict as 
the Empires dominant groups have sought to impose their culture more widely. The
Ethiopian Empire which resisted most European colonial encroachment in the 19th 
and 20th century was itself dominated by an ethnic Amharic elite.
 
The last Emperor Haile Selassie oversaw sometimes brutal attempts to forge an 
Ethiopian nationalism based on Amharic culture. When he was overthrown in the 
1970s, these policies continued and reached new horrors under the following 
Marxist-Leninist military Derg government.

National Liberation oriented parties and military organizations based in Tigray,
Eritrea, Oromia and other regions united to overthrew the Derg by 1991 and 
established a system of “ethnic federalism.”
 
Nine states were established on the basis of ethnic self-determination. But a 
degree of greater equality between ethnic groups did not end ethnic conflict. 
The inability to represent the messy and overlapping geography of various 
groups, as well as the numerous groups too small to receive their own region, 
provided fuel for further conflict. Ethnic conflict became intimately 
intertwined with political disputes.
 
The Oromo, the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia, have faced systemic 
discrimination for decades. An Oromo-based party central to overthrowing the 
Derg was pushed out of the new governing coalition early on. Despite some new 
autonomy within the ethnic federalist system, discrimination remains widespread,
and massive protests have been met with violent reprisals as recently as last 
year. Many politicized Oromo are today advocate ending the Ethiopian Empire 
altogether.

Recently, a new governing coalition was formed when the largest Tigrayan party 
(TPLF) exited the government. The rest of the former coalition merged to form 
the new Prosperity Party under Abiy Ahmed. The present government seeks to 
dismantle “ethnic federalism” in favor of a centralized state promoting a 
unified “Ethiopian” identity. Powerful ethnic-based political parties are a 
significant obstacle to this goal. To secure victory in its political agenda, 
Abiy’s government has made all Tigrayan people synonymous with the TPLF 
political party in the view of the country’s mass media and war machine, 
launching an all-out struggle against both.
 
Abiy’s construction of a nationalist base at home has been complimented by his 
efforts to secure support abroad. In a piece of bitter irony, he was given the 
Nobel Peace Prize for bringing a decades long conflict with the totalitarian 
government of neighboring Eritrea to an end. Violent struggle had simmered since
Eritrea’s secession from Ethiopia following the collapse of the Derg. The 
presence of Eritrean political refugees in Tigray and ongoing resentment over 
the previous war made Abiy’s peace partners an ideal collaborator in genocide. 
Eritrean ground forces have been responsible for some of the most horrific 
massacres, plundering, and destruction of the countryside.

Coffee Grows Empire
 
Any present-day empire building project in Ethiopia needs a fervent nationalist 
base. Yet in the modern global system, Ethiopia’s empire is but a small and 
sometimes exploited player. Projecting necessitates extensive foreign capital 
and support. Drones bombing civilian towns, bullets digging mass graves, media 
infrastructure to justify it all. This requires cash.
 
Some of this may come in the form of foreign aid, or the loans neocolonial 
institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund are currently 
trying to approve. For the Ethiopian state, though, much of their cash comes 
from commodity export. King of Ethiopia’s exports is a crop it originated: 
coffee. A billion US dollars, 30% of the country’s total exports, sent to eighty
countries around the world.

The central state has a heavy, lucrative hand in the trade. It manages commodity
exchange markets. It carries out direct diplomacy and negotiations with major 
buyers. The Ethiopian state even holds several international trademarks on the 
names of notable Ethiopian coffee. Companies selling specialty coffee using 
these names must pay the government a licensing fee.
 
Securing this funding pipeline is vital to the Ethiopian state’s functioning.
 
Take Action
 
Campaigners against the ongoing genocide in Tigray have called for a boycott of 
Ethiopian coffee in order to cut into Abiy Ahmed’s war chest. Among the largest 
and most visible buyers globally is Starbucks. The company purchases tens of 
millions USD of Ethiopian coffee annually, only a fraction of which makes it 
directly to farmers. During an ongoing genocide, this money fuels death.
 
We are calling for a global week of action against Starbucks to demand they 
cease purchase of Ethiopian coffee while the military occupation of Tigray 
continues.
 
From May 1 to May 7 we encourage solidarity in the form of a diversity of 
tactics from comrades around the world. 
 
What can you do to spread the message about stopping the genocide in Tigray and 
take direct action against Starbucks?
 
  * Get a few friends to do some flyering, wheatpasting, graffiti, and/or banner
  drops.
  * Hold picket lines of stores, perhaps collaborating with workers.
  * Can you organize a large march locally, or small autonomous action against a
  Starbucks store at night.
  * Is your city home to an Ethiopian or Eritrean embassy or consulate? Consider
  whether you might include it in your action.
 
If you live in one of many areas around the world with Tigray, Oromo, and other 
diaspora communities, please reach out. Many major cities have a local community
center and have been holding their own protests against the current government’s
actions. Look for these events, often on social media, and join in solidarity.
