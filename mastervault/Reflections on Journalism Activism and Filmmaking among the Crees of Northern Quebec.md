Jasmin Habib, Interviewer University of Waterloo
Introduction

Β'

oyce Richardson has had a long history of engage

1 ment with the James Bay Cree of Νorthern Quebec.
:

The citation for the Order of Canada in 2002 reads in part:

"he has used his creativity to draw public attention to
social issues, engendering compassion through mutual
understanding and giving voice to the concerns of his
subjects."
In this interview, conducted in his Ottawa home in the

autumn of 2009, Boyce Richardson reflects on his experi

ences as a journalist, researcher, author, and filmmaker.
After reading Strangers Devour the Land (1974/2008),
I approached Boyce Richardson for a discussion about
the role of advisors, consultants and other allies in the

course of my research on "Ethnography and Indigenous
Co-Authorship: Multi-vocal texts and a monograph on
James Bay Cree visions and practices of relational co

governance" (with Harvey Feit). In Strangers Devour

the Land, Boyce Richardson offers a much-cited account
of the court proceedings that led to the James Bay and
Northern Quebec Cree Agreement (JBNQA) in 1975. A
brief summary is provided here to offer the reader both a
context for understanding his engagement with the Crees
in that moment, as well as for some of his comments below.
