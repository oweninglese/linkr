“Her life mattered. She was valued. She was important. She was loved.”
 
R. v. Barton [2019] S.C.J. No. 33.
 
 
Cindy Gladue was an Indigenous woman originally from Alberta, where she grew up 
with her four siblings and extended family. She was also the mother to three 
daughters and her family described her as both a loving mother and caring 
auntie. She had close friends and always dreamed about being the first in her 
family to go to university. Cindy Gladue loved and was loved. She did not 
deserve her violent death in 2011 nor the indignity done to her body after. 
 
 
She is now one of the many thousands of murdered and missing Indigenous women 
and girls in Canada — a growing crisis that represents grave human rights 
violations. The trial of the man who admittedly committed this act of violence 
against Cindy is an example of how defective Canada’s justice system is when it 
comes to Indigenous women victims and how negligent Canada has been in ensuring 
the basic human rights of Indigenous women and girls are met.
 
 
In this column, there will be no details about Cindy’s appearance, what she wore
the night she was killed, where she was killed, whether she knew her killer, her
level of education, her health status, or what she did for a living — because 
none of the facts is relevant to her death. Cindy is not to blame for her death.
Cindy did not kill herself. Cindy did not engage in a dangerous knife fight or 
try to kill someone.
 
 
Regardless of which version of the story is accepted by the next trial judge — 
that she was killed by a male trucker who violently cut an 11-cm gash in her 
vagina, or that she died from a tear from his violent, but unarmed interaction 
with her — she still died as a result. According to the SCC quoting from 
evidence at trial, the trucker then tried to hide evidence, change the crime 
scene and lie about his involvement. His name doesn’t deserve to be said aloud, 
nor does he get to hide behind any of the racist or sexist excuses he used at 
trial to defend himself. None of the evidence referred to at trial or the SCC 
indicates that he should be believed. Cindy’s life story does not get to be 
narrated by the man who admits to committing this violence against her.
 
 
Sexualized violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada has been 
allowed to continue in plain sight by government officials, police officers, 
lawyers and judges who have treated Indigenous women and girls as though they 
are less worthy of life. In fact, were it not for the lengthy and persistent 
advocacy of Indigenous women and their allies, Canadians would still be unaware 
of the crisis.
 
 
However, awareness of the crisis only gets us so far. The court proceedings 
which followed Cindy’s death show just how deeply engrained racism and sexism 
against Indigenous women still is in Canadian society, especially the justice 
system. In R. v. Barton [2019] S.C.J. No. 33, Justice Michael Moldaver, writing 
for the majority, allowed the accused’s appeal in part and sent the matter back 
to trial, but only on the charge of the unlawful act of manslaughter. The 
dissent would have dismissed the accused’s appeal entirely. Justices Rosalie 
Silberman Abella and Andromache Karakatsanis writing for the dissent (Chief 
Justice Richard Wagner concurring) agreed with the Alberta Court of Appeal that 
the matter be ordered back for retrial on both charges of first-degree murder 
and manslaughter. 
 
 
The majority made some important points about the extent to which racism is 
still widespread in the justice system. At para.199, the majority explained: 
“Furthermore, this Court has acknowledged on several occasions the detrimental 
effects of widespread racism against Indigenous people within our criminal 
justice system. For example, in Williams, this Court recognized that Indigenous 
people are the target of hurtful biases, stereotypes, and assumptions, including
stereotypes about credibility, worthiness, and criminal propensity, to name just
a few. … In short, when it comes to truth and reconciliation from a criminal 
justice system perspective, much-needed work remains to be done.”
 
 
They went on to say that the criminal justice system and all of its participants
must take reasonable steps to address these biases — especially against 
Indigenous women. To this end, they directed that, on a go forward basis, trial 
judges ought to provide express instruction to juries to counter the well-known 
prejudice against Indigenous women. While there is no set text, trial judges 
should instruct juries about Indigenous women and girls having been subjected to
a long history of colonization and systemic racism and then dispel myths about 
Indigenous women and those who are exploited for sex. These stereotypes were 
outlined in para. 202:
 
 
- Are not entitled to legal protections;
 
- Not deserving of respect, humanity and dignity;
 
- Are sexual objects for male gratification;
 
- Are available for the taking and no consent needed;
 
- Assume any risks associated with “sex work”;
 
- Are less credible than other people.
 
 
The majority further stressed that, as a matter of respect, both the Crown and 
the defence counsel should have referred to her as Ms. Gladue instead of “Native
girl” during the trial. These are important points and the SCC made many 
important clarifications in the case in relation to the many problems 
surrounding sexual assault cases.
 
 
However, there is a downside to the majority’s decision. Their logic and 
reasoning around the impact of racism and bias in this case did not follow 
through to their ultimate finding. The majority allowed the accused’s appeal in 
part, by limiting the charge for which the killer could be retried — 
manslaughter only. The dissent pointed out that racism doesn’t work that way and
can’t be so easily compartmentalized. They explained that there was no “filter” 
on the victim’s prior sexual history and no warning by the judge to the jury to 
avoid making stereotypical assumptions about Indigenous women.
 
 
They also argued that this created an image of Cindy “that was unfair and would 
have permeated the whole trial and the jury’s deliberations on both murder and 
manslaughter” (para. 214). The dissent further emphasized, “He [trial judge] 
provided no specific instructions crafted to confront the operative social and 
racial biases potentially at work. This rendered the whole trial unfair” (para. 
215). 
 
 
While the dissent did go further than the majority, they too missed an important
opportunity to speak to the indignity committed against Cindy’s body after her 
death when segments of her vagina were brought into court as an exhibit. Cindy 
was a life-giving mother of three girls. Her body and her life-giving parts had 
already suffered a gross violation which led to her death. There was no 
necessity — in an effort to prosecute her killer — to remove her life-giving 
parts and put them on display in a courtroom. They could have used the coroner’s
testimony, animated illustrations of the extent of the cut or tear, and 
worst-case scenario, pictures. Putting her life-giving parts on display served 
to further dehumanize her before the judge and jury. 
 
 
Even though the SCC made some important findings in this case, their caution 
that the justice system has a lot more work to do applies equally to them. We 
need more than the “important step forward” they commended themselves for — we 
need a wholescale change. That won’t happen if the highest court in the land 
cannot call out and end the kind of indignity committed against Cindy — which 
represents the many indignities committed against Indigenous women and girls 
since contact.
