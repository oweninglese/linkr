Early in 1839 a group of “coloured inhabitants” in Upper Canada gathered to  
draft a petition to the home government in London.^1 The memorial requested that  
the British government protect self-emancipated people from cross-border pursuit  
by United States authorities and ensure their social and intellectual advancement  
in Canada; and it did so on the grounds that the refugees were “subjects of the  
British Monarch.”^2 The letter was entrusted to Thomas Rolph, a white surgeon  
from England, who then asked the governor general of British North America to  
forward it to the colonial secretary in London. To the petitioners’ dismay, no reply  
came. Suspecting that the governor general failed to act on Rolph’s request, they  
turned to George Arthur, lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, who delivered the  
letter in May 1839.^3 After crossing the Atlantic, the memorial circulated through  
the metropolitan administrative sphere, leaving the colonial secretary’s hands for  
the legal advisors to the Crown.  
During the late 1830s and early 1840s, seeking to enjoy the full benefits of  
British freedom, formerly enslaved African Americans from the United States  
developed communications linking Canada and the metropole and sought to incor-  
porate themselves into the empire through those networks. Expressions of British  
identity by black runaways are not particularly novel stories in the field of African  
American history; affiliation with Britain and its freedom is known to have been  
an appealing and strategic choice for escaping U.S. African Americans not only  
for its symbolic power as the antithesis to U.S. slavery, but also for what histori-  
an Van Gosse called Britain’s extensive presence as “an imperial totality.”^4  
Contextualizing U.S. African Americans’ recourse to the Crown within Britain’s  
increasing assumption of abolitionist moral superiority to regain its imperial influ-  
ence after 1783, Gosse described how the empire’s new post-Revolution agenda  
provided African Americans in and outside the United States with a transatlantic  
apparatus within which to fight slavery through the empire’s economic, military,

cultural, and diplomatic channels. Canada was the most prominent “site for con-  
crete solidarity” where metropolitan and Canadian abolitionists successfully lob-  
bied administrators on behalf of cross-border runaways to prevent fugitive extra-  
ditions to the United States.^5  
What has been absent from this narrative of British–African American alliance  
is that Britain’s moral and political imperative toward the self-emancipated did not  
become a matter of course. During the late 1830s and early 1840s, black refugees  
themselves had to actively solicit the metropole’s support by fashioning themselves  
as British emancipated subjects deserving of the empire’s protection and tutelage.  
Setting foot on British territory did not automatically lead to a recognition of  
British subjecthood; African Americans who settled in Canada wrote letters, sub-  
mitted petitions, and held public meetings to appeal to metropolitan whites’ self-  
image as benevolent emancipators. With their undeterred efforts, formerly enslaved  
U.S. African Americans convinced British abolitionists to treat the protection and  
advancement of their freedom as part of the imperial agenda, and to work for the  
successful circumvention of a bilateral extradition law with the United States.  
In foregrounding cross-border runaways’ reconstitution of self in their new  
environment in British North America, I draw on work that highlights protean and  
contextual identity performances among mobile individuals in the African  
Diaspora. Moving away from the traditional model that places diasporic subjects  
on a linear progression toward identity formation, these studies pay attention to  
shifting identifications articulated by those who traveled itinerantly over the  
course of their lifetimes and to their strategic self-fashioning within the cultural  
milieu of their immediate location.^6 Focus on the flexibility of identification  
adapted to “constantly shifting sets of sociopolitical demands” holds a particular  
resonance in the examination of formerly enslaved African Americans who recog-  
nized the need to secure freedom and make progress within the social and politi-  
cal bounds of the British Empire.^7  
Their pursuit of imperial membership, I further argue, took place along racial  
lines, that is, through black diasporic affiliation. Self-emancipated African  
Americans advanced their integration by identifying with West Indian freedpeo-  
ple—the legitimate and authentic beneficiaries of British emancipation. While  
metropolitan abolitionists sometimes lumped them with East Indians under the  
category of British emancipated “blacks,” the refugees in Canada primarily equat-  
ed themselves with their fellow “British Negroes” in the West Indies and contin-  
ued to do so in the 1850s, prompting participation of a black Jamaican in this inter-  
colonial racial identification. In this sense, their diasporic identity formations  
reveal the potency of what historian Michael A. Gomez calls “a single status, a  
lone condition, that of blackness, of descent of Africa” as well as the powerful  
symbolic value of West Indians in British freedom discourse.^8

While articulating a sense of black collective advancement in the empire, such  
diasporic identifications took shape within constricted institutional and discursive  
spheres delineated by inequitable racial structures of the post-emancipation empire.  
The limitations and promises of British identity in “an empire founded on race”  
have been central themes in historical scholarship on “the black experience of  
Empire.”^9 Putting their diasporic politics in this light, this essay shows how propo-  
nents of British black identity had to navigate the straits of labor and cultural sys-  
tems of emancipation that were racially exploitative and denigrating. Because of  
their reliance on and genuine belief in Britain’s abolitionist authority, these African-  
descended people were compelled to constitute their British identities within the  
ideologies and institutions of the burgeoning regime of freedom, but never fully  
conformed to its hierarchical structures of racial governance. “British Negroes”  
thus negotiated their place in the empire as they walked a delicate line between  
ambivalently reinforcing and subtly subverting its racial inequities.  
For cross-border runaways, black imperial identity was a double-edged sword:  
it connected them to Britain’s anti-slavery movement, but also to its asymmetrical  
orders of freedom. Within this narrow field of self-constitution and identity perform-  
ance, U.S.-origin refugees made the most of what was available to them as they real-  
ized the disturbing flexibility of the border between American slavery and British  
freedom. Seeking protection and assistance from the metropole, they wrote and  
spoke as British subjects. What follows is an exploration of an African American  
politics that emerged within a nexus of British empire and African Diaspora. Above  
all, it is a testament to self-emancipated people’s unflinching pursuit of freedom.

ENTERING THE EMPIRE
```

In the eyes of U.S. African American refugees, Canada was far from a land of  
complete freedom. The fragility of their free status was instituted by the Upper  
Canadian legislature in February 1833 with an act that provided for the extradition  
of “Fugitive Offenders from Foreign Countries,” under which individuals charged  
with “Murder, Forgery, Larceny, or other crime” could be returned to their origi-  
nal places of the alleged crime.^10 The law stipulated that the governor and the  
executive council could decide whether to surrender the charged person. While the  
fugitives might well have counted on the provincial authorities for compassion,  
historian Jason Silverman notes that the act “obviously threatened the freedom of  
all runaway slaves from the United States: first, because many slaves indeed com-  
mitted such crimes in the process of escaping; second, because slave owners might  
bring false charges in order to regain their property.”^11  
The petitioners in the opening example denounced extradition as a breach of  
imperial sovereignty, whereby “Her subjects” have “but too often been inveigled

and forced back into all the horrors of slavery” by “their former owners whose  
cupidity and thirst for power...will not consent to give up their supposed right  
over them, even though living under the protection of the British flag.”^12 The  
memorial recounted an arrest of an escaped individual from authorities in  
Kentucky who hunted him down to Upper Canada on charges of stealing a horse.  
The extradition was aborted only because “a body of his coloured brethren who  
like himself had escaped from the galling yoke of slavery” set the wanted man  
free.^13 These fugitives from the U.S. slave regime, “who were determined to per-  
ish to a man, rather than behold their brother surrendered up to the merciless feroc-  
ity of his former master,” lost two of their compatriots during the rescue. With the  
memory of the arrest and deaths fresh in their minds, the petitioners ardently dis-  
played loyalty to the British Empire so as to “be regarded and considered as nat-  
uralized subjects of Great Britain, to be alike protected by as well as rendered  
amenable to British law.”^14  
In addition to governmental protection against extraditions, the memorial  
requested the promotion of schools for African American children on the grounds  
that governmental funds had been expended on the education of freedpeople in the  
British West Indies. Casting their appeal in a nationalist light and linking it to their  
willingness to “become good Christians, good subjects, and enlightened members  
of the community,” the petitioners cited “the liberal and munificent donations  
bestowed on their brethren in the West Indies by Her Majesty’s Government, for  
the purpose of promoting their moral and religious instruction.”^15 By identifying  
themselves as the Canadian counterpart of the West Indian emancipated people,  
the memorialists justified their hope that “some aid \[would\] be extended to the  
colored population of Upper Canada.”^16  
The “donations” given to the West Indians included the “Negro Education  
Grant,” a subsidy from the imperial government initiated in 1835 for the educa-  
tion of the formerly enslaved population.^17 This policy emerged against the back-  
drop of the home government’s broader endeavor to institute a “structure of labor  
control” designed to ensure the freedpeople’s productivity under the new princi-  
ples of wage labor.^18 Embedded in the tenets of bourgeois political economy, this  
state-initiated effort went beyond economic concerns and aimed at changing the  
overall structure of the former slave colonies into “the right sort of society and cul-  
ture.”^19 In that model, according to Thomas C. Holt, freedpeople would act in pur-  
suit of “personal accumulation and \[in\] deference to proper authority” within a  
gendered social order divided into the masculinized terrain of wage work and the  
feminized domestic realm of reproduction and consumption.^20 The educational  
effort was thus a bid to transform emancipated West Indians into colonial free  
laborers with the proper intellect, piety, industry, and material desires deemed nec-  
essary to ensure stable agricultural production.

**_Self-Emancipated People in Canada and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire_** **223**

This new principle of free labor, however, contradicted both the reality of the  
plantations and freedpeople’s own economic and social objectives. Emancipated  
people in Jamaica, for example, sought to manage their labor at their own discre-  
tion as they combined plantation work and small-scale cultivation for self-suffi-  
ciency and local market exchange.^21 Also, if some women withdrew from estate  
labor, it was not because they complied with bourgeois gender ideology; rather,  
they sought protection from grueling physical drudgery and assurance of the sur-  
vival of their domestic and communal life independent of the planter class.^22 In  
accordance with these alternative ethics, freedmen and women carved out a social,  
familial, and economic life that conflicted with the maximization of profits from  
wage-based estate production.  
Likewise, the petitioners in Canada showed no sign of perceiving themselves  
as wage laborers as they appropriated the powerful national banner of post-eman-  
cipation “reform.” Their aspirations for intellectual and moral improvement were  
divorced from the capitalist principle of labor efficiency. Their vision was to repli-  
cate in Canada institutions of emancipation devoid of liberal economic functions  
and to use them to create a self-sustaining population of self-emancipated people.  
The imperial government’s response to the 1839 petition boded poorly for the  
security of the freedom of fugitives from U.S. slavery. The return dispatch from  
London mentioned the Queen’s “satisfaction at the sentiments of ardent attach-  
ment to Her Person and Government” expressed by the petitioners, but exhibited  
the British government’s passive stance on fugitive slave extradition. It cited a  
report of the Law Officers of the Crown that “under the existing law of Upper  
Canada no difference was made between colored and white men—between fugi-  
tive slaves and other individuals arriving in Canada from the United States—and  
that it would not be lawful to deliver up a fugitive slave in any circumstances in  
which a white man would not also be delivered up.”^23 In sum, the report conclud-  
ed that cross-border runaways would not be subjected to a higher chance of extra-  
dition than would white individuals, but that neither would there be any special  
legal shield for the former. The dispatch stated that this principle, if implemented  
properly, was “amply sufficient for the protection of the petitioners” and that  
beyond the equal application of the law “Her Majesty has no power to advance,  
nor to grant to one class of Her Subjects privileges or immunities not enjoyed by  
others.”^24 With regard to the promotion of educational facilities, the secretary  
directed the petitioners to appeal to the provincial legislature.  
It should be noted, however, that while the home government promised no  
special protection or educational opportunities for U.S. African Americans fleeing  
to Canada, the correspondence suggests a certain degree of success in introducing  
them into official imperial discourse as one group of black British subjects. To  
begin, the lieutenant governor of Upper Canada found the petition by “Her

Majesty’s coloured subjects,” as he called them, legitimate enough to place it in  
the imperial administrative network.^25 The officials in London then defined the  
home government’s approach toward the protection of the refugees’ freedom.  
While the decision was not to implement any concrete measures, the reason for the  
inaction—that “Her Majesty has no power to advance, nor to grant to one class of  
Her Subjects privileges or immunities not enjoyed by others”—implies recogni-  
tion that these formerly enslaved U.S. African Americans were indeed “Her  
Subjects.”^26  
This limited victory did not immediately change the grim reality facing self-  
emancipated people. The officials viewed fugitive slave extradition as a legitimate  
bilateral system, not an aggression on state sovereignty that the memorial made it  
out to be. To black refugees from the United States the absence of slavery in  
Canada was a British condition that should be maintained within its colonial  
boundaries. Thus, any exertion of U.S. jurisdiction in Canada signified an infiltra-  
tion of the border between British freedom and American slavery. This rigid sep-  
aration of free and unfree spaces did not win the hearts of British officials, who  
were well aware of the role of diplomatic relations in shaping the operation of the  
U.S.-Canadian border.  
Outside official imperial networks, inter-colonial diasporic identities flour-  
ished in various cultural venues in Canada. An 1839 prospectus for the periodical  
_The British American Journal of Liberty_ was a case in point. In solidifying the  
identity of the black newcomers as “Her Majesty’s Coloured subjects in Upper  
Canada,” the editors Peter Gallego and E. L. De St. Remy looked southward to  
another group of emancipated people for political and racial association. The two  
men promised to report on “the progress of our fellow subjects in the West Indies,”  
a promise reflective of their diasporic identity as well as their referential use of the  
West Indians to gauge the prospects and possibilities available for the emancipat-  
ed African-descended people in the empire.^27  
The practice of inter-colonial identification very likely developed out of the  
annual imperial emancipation celebrations that originated in the West Indies to pub-  
licly display and nurture loyal sentiments around the British abolition of slavery.^28  
The patriotic function of these rituals differed from the much-discussed politics of  
West Indian emancipation in the United States that championed the event as a rally-  
ing point to oppose U.S. slavery.^29 Rather in Canada, British emancipation became  
a symbol around which self-emancipated people forged commonality with those in  
the West Indies as subject beneficiaries of that policy. An 1841 imperial emancipa-  
tion celebration illustrates this point. In Chatham, Canada, one of the Detroit River  
border towns, formerly enslaved U.S. African Americans explicitly cast themselves  
as one group of emancipated subjects who were enjoying the blessings of the 1833  
act, and they “celebrated the important event of their emancipation throughout the

British dominions—in a manner, too, that showed the value and consequence  
attached by them to the boon of freedom.”^30 The celebrations included a procession  
that “paraded through the streets for some time, to the number of about one hundred”  
and a festive dinner in the evening, after which “they figured away in the merry  
dance until a late hour.”^31 Similarly, three years later, at a meeting of black refugees  
in the same town, they expressed their gratitude for “what \[Britain had\] done and  
thanked “her noble statesmen” for “break\[ing\] the fetters of the Slave.”^32 Here the  
“Slave” referred to the formerly enslaved African Americans in Canada (many  
refugees from the United States) and “our brethren in the West Indies,” both  
“Coloured Subjects of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria.”^33  
These sentiments and performances of British identity circulated in print  
through newspapers and eventually reached London. In 1840 their voice also  
entered metropolitan abolitionist circles through the medium of the same Thomas  
Rolph. This time, Rolph used as his platform the World Anti-Slavery Convention  
of June 1840, convened by the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS),  
a fledgling London-based abolitionist organization. Self-emancipated people’s  
call for help resonated well at the convention conceived to present new directions  
for British abolitionism in the post-emancipation era.  
At this international forum, U.S. African American runaways constituted the  
convention’s agenda under the category “Condition of the Emancipated,” which  
also included important information on African-descended peoples in Haiti, South  
America, and the British West Indies.^34 As the primary messenger on behalf of  
black refugees, Rolph not only presented to the metropolitan audience their capac-  
ities to be ideal colonial subjects, but also conveyed their own ideas of British  
freedom and identity.^35  
The highlight of Rolph’s presentation was an excerpt of a meeting of  
“Coloured People at Ancaster,” Canada, convened earlier to draft appeals to the  
imperial and provincial governments, with the intent of sharing them at the World  
Anti-Slavery Convention.^36 In a tone similar to the 1839 memorial, the partici-  
pants announced that they “emigrate to this and other British colonies to enjoy that  
liberty and protection which alone is afforded by the British Government and law”  
and asked the provincial legislature and the Crown to enact a law providing for a  
trial by jury for an alleged fugitive before he or she “shall be handed over to the  
authorities of the United States.”^37 After the address, Rolph and five abolitionists  
from different cities in the British Isles founded a committee, which recommend-  
ed that the convention press the issue with colonial administrators in Canada.^38  
With the increasing outcry from Canada, metropolitan abolitionists began to  
discuss self-emancipated people along with other groups of the British emancipat-  
ed. There is evidence that black refugees in Canada were associated with recently  
emancipated black West Indians within the context of a distinctly imperial govern-

ing structure: the itinerant appointment of administrative officers to different colo-  
nial posts. In 1843 Thomas Clarkson, the driving force behind British emancipa-  
tion, appealed to Charles Metcalf, the governor of Canada who once governed  
Jamaica as well, for the protection of African American escapees in his province.  
In his communication Clarkson painted a picture of runaways becoming “produc-  
tive of great good to _the mother country_ ” as they were “a _quiet_ and _orderly_ peo-  
ple” who gave “no trouble to the government.”^39 What is notable is that Clarkson  
founded the plausibility of this blueprint upon “the _spirit of independency_ , the  
_industry_ and the _prodigious execution_ of the _free \[N\]egro_ in Jamaica,” which,  
Clarkson claimed, “No one knows better than Your Excellency.”^40  
In expressing his confidence that Metcalf would “protect the unhappy fugi-  
tives against the claims of an enraged master,” Clarkson posited a paternalistic  
image of the governor as a colonial administrator who routinely presided over dif-  
ferent groups of freedpeople living throughout the empire. “When he left his  
Government at Jamaica,” Clarkson declared, “ten thousand emancipated slaves  
followed him to the water’s edge with tears, to take their leave of him. He is the  
same benevolent man in Canada, as he was in Jamaica as favors the poor \[N\]egro  
is concerned.”^41 The cultural figure of the benevolent British governor with inter-  
colonial mobility went hand in hand with a vision of separately located emanci-  
pated peoples contributing to imperial prosperity under an itinerant administrator.  
The system of rotating colonial governorship thus helped link distant emancipat-  
ed subjects within the white imperial imagination.  
More importantly, African ancestry was not the exclusive register of common-  
ality for metropolitan abolitionists. They went beyond Canada and the West Indies  
in their mapping of the British emancipated to include East Indians in Malabar  
who had been freed by the East India Company in 1836. In 1846, three years after  
Clarkson’s correspondence with Metcalf, abolitionist William T. Blair made the  
connection between the self-emancipated people in Canada and freedpeople in the  
coastal region of southwestern India.^42 The abolitionist from Bath asked the  
BFASS leadership to publish his letter, which stressed the British government’s  
duty of “elevating the slaves to a real state of freedom” and the need for quick  
implementation of governmental systems of education.^43 The areas of concern  
were two British colonial spaces—Canada and East India:

```
The government ought to provide funds for schools, and authorize their offices in the provinces
of Canada and Malabar to appropriate government lands and to afford every facility to their
instruction and amelioration. At present nothing is done but by sufferance. The government
do[es] not actually impede, but the next thing to it,—what is required is a positive order to this
government to forward the education, and the amelioration of the classes in every possible way,
and to countenance and assist every population for the freedom secured to them by British law.^44

**_Self-Emancipated People in Canada and the Antebellum Politics of Diaspora and Empire_** **227**

In Blair’s mind, both East Indians and formerly enslaved U.S. African Americans  
in Canada were British emancipated subjects and their successful transition to  
freedom represented the triumph of the imperial move to abolition.  
The coupling of the two groups made sense given the history of racial group-  
ing in the metropole. By the late 18th century, East Indian seamen, or lascars,  
became a visible presence in English seaport cities. Called “Asiatic blacks” by  
metropolitan whites, South Asians constituted the “blacks,” along with people of  
Sub-Saharan African descent. In 1786 they became an object of a private (and later  
government-funded) relief effort aimed at the “black poor” in London, a designa-  
tion covering both East Indian and West Indian “blacks” in London, often identi-  
fied by their impoverished condition and need of British benevolence. Criminal  
records and Parliamentary Papers reveal that this situation for the black poor con-  
tinued well into the 19th century.^45 Within this cultural milieu William Blair artic-  
ulated the association between emancipated “blacks” in Malabar and Canada and  
the need to establish imperial policy appropriate for both.  
Despite abolitionists’ growing recognition of formerly enslaved U.S. African  
Americans in Canada as emancipated British subjects, the imperial government  
allowed an extradition back to the United States in 1842, which was in some ways  
not surprising given the reaction to the 1839 petition from Canada. The protago-  
nist, Nelson Hackett, was a runaway and fugitive from Arkansas who succeeded  
in crossing the Detroit River sometime in September 1841. He was tracked down  
and arrested by two slave catchers from Arkansas and charged with stealing a  
beaver overcoat, a gold watch, a saddle, and a horse from his master and others.  
The Washington County Grand Jury of Arkansas had indicted Hackett for grand  
larceny, and Arkansas Governor Archibald Yell requested that the Canadian gov-  
ernment surrender Hackett as a “criminal” fugitive. In January 1842, the governor  
general of Canada, Charles Bagot, ordered that Hackett be turned over to  
Arkansas. In response, BFASS secretary John Scoble labored to find ways to  
block the extradition, contacting diverse parties in the United States and England,  
including American Lewis Tappen and the British Colonial Office. Unfortunately,  
the group’s efforts did not bear fruit and the extradition took place later in 1842.^46  
On the heels of Nelson Hackett’s surrender to U.S. slave catchers came a new  
challenge to the freedom of African Americans escaping to Canada: the Webster-  
Ashburton Treaty, a new U.S.-British bilateral agreement under negotiation in

1842. The specific issue was Article 10 of the treaty that provided for the mutual  
      surrender of fugitive “criminals” and thus placed in jeopardy the freedom of black  
      refugees living in Canada. Fearing that the article would be applied specifically to  
      fugitive “slaves” in Canada and other British territories, the BFASS campaigned  
      for their exemption, petitioning the Parliament; the Foreign Secretary, George

Hamilton-Gordon, the Fourth Earl of Aberdeen; and Alexander Baring, the First  
Baron of Ashburton, who authored the treaty.^47  
The BFASS’s campaign could not have occurred without the untiring appeals  
from escaped African Americans themselves who managed to persuade the aboli-  
tionists that the refugees were entitled to freedom as British subjects. Such recog-  
nition also influenced the way the self-emancipated were constructed in the  
BFASS’s annual reports. The June 1843 report covered the period of the Hackett  
extradition and the Webster-Ashburton Treaty; the issue of “fugitive slaves”  
appeared in the “Home Operations” section pertaining to slavery and post-eman-  
cipation conditions in the British colonies, not in “Foreign Operations,” which  
covered individuals the society considered “non-British subjects” such as the  
enslaved populations in the United States and Brazil.^48 “Fugitive Slaves within the  
British Dominions” was also added to the group’s agenda, and was listed with  
concerns about post-emancipation conditions in the British West Indies, antislav-  
ery campaigns in British East India and British settlements in Southeast Asia, and  
enslaved “British subjects” in the Spanish and Dutch colonies.^48 Further illustrat-  
ing the society’s interests, the “Home Operations” section of the BFASS’s fourth  
annual report concluded with an exhortation that the extradition issue required  
“the best attention of British abolitionists.”^50  
The British government soon backed away from the enforcement of Webster-  
Ashburton’s Article 10 on fugitive slave extraditions. This was triggered in 1844  
when seven enslaved workers from Florida escaped to Nassau in the Bahamas;  
they faced a risk of extradition on charges of murder in the United States. The  
British government, having adopted a policy of preventing extraditions on the  
basis of procedural technicalities, successfully argued that the documents submit-  
ted were insufficient to prove the fugitives’ crime.^51 Britain’s stance was further  
consolidated when Foreign Secretary Aberdeen refused to concede to the U.S.  
government’s request for the invocation of Article 10 in fugitive slave cases.^52 By  
1845 British abolitionists concluded British soil to be safe from the voracious  
force of the U.S. authorities. With their persistent assertions of free British identi-  
ty, self-emancipated people successfully elicited support and protection from met-  
ropolitan abolitionists and British officials.

### ARTICULATIONS OF “THE BRITISH NEGRO”

Acutely aware that the West Indian freedpeople constituted a primary symbol  
of British emancipation and progress, formerly enslaved U.S. African Americans  
living in Canada continued to forge a common identity with their Caribbean coun-  
terparts. After the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law, which led to a substan-  
tial increase in the number of cross-border black migrants, identification with

Afro-West Indians proliferated in African American public discourse inside and  
outside Canada. Samuel Ringgold Ward, a seasoned African American abolition-  
ist from New York, spearheaded this identification. In many ways Ward was not a  
typical runaway, for he had escaped from slavery at the age of three with his par-  
ents and had lived as a free person in New York State until he fled to Canada.  
Although with no personal memory of enslavement, he saw himself as a fugitive  
from U.S. slavery, but for a slightly different reason. In October 1851 Ward and  
other members of the Syracuse Vigilance Committee rescued runaway Jerry  
McHenry from federal authorities and helped him escape to Kingston, Canada.  
Ward and Jermain Loguen, the vice chairman of the vigilance committee, soon  
afterward left for Canada themselves, fearing arrest for obstructing the Fugitive  
Slave Law.^53 Equating his escape from arrest with escaping workers’ flight from  
re-enslavement, both fleeing the pro-slavery regime, Ward declared to fugitive  
Henry Bibb, “I am, like yourself, a refugee.”^54

Samuel Ward constructed an idealized black West Indian figure by articulat-  
ing visions of freedom and belonging for his oppressed people. He built a com-  
mon black British identity upon both differences and commonalities between “this  
large and growing class of Her Majesty’s subjects” in Canada and “the descen-

dants of Africa, in other parts of the empire.”^55 Noting that “the blacks in the West  
Indies, now among the wealthiest, most learned and most influential of Her  
Majesty’s colonial subjects, were, a century ago, poor and as illiterate as we are  
now \[due to what\] Slavery did to them.” Ward proclaimed to his fellow refugees,  
“What they are, we must be. We must become such by our own efforts, as did they.  
We cannot begin too soon.”^56 In explaining his decision to found a black newspa-  
per in Canada, Ward defined it as an advocate for the social, economic, and polit-  
ical advancement of formerly enslaved people and to raise them “to the proud  
position of the blacks in other parts of our glorious empire.”^57 In his blueprint for  
the future within the British Empire, the West Indian freedpeople served as a  
model of progress for recent arrivals from the United States.  
Ward also intended this inter-colonial affiliation to help him solicit assistance  
from the metropolitan public since he was fully aware of the utility of the West  
Indian freedpeople—the most prominent symbol of British benevolent paternal-  
ism—in appealing to white Britons’ pride as benefactors of emancipation and  
progress. During his tour around the British Isles to raise funds on former slaves’  
behalf, Ward categorized emancipated black West Indians and Canadians, and  
self-emancipated U.S. African Americans in Canada as the “British Negro,”  
ascribing to them devotion to imperial prosperity and to Christian faith.^58  
In his speeches throughout the United Kingdom, Ward emphasized the contri-  
bution of African-descended subjects to the affluence of the empire, categorizing  
black West Indians and Canadians as one distinct group of colonial laborers.  
“Indeed to the British people,” he claimed at a public meeting, “was committed a  
very large proportion of the \[N\]egro race.”^59 “How many of that race,” he contin-  
ued, “were labouring for the welfare of Great Britain in the West Indies and in  
Canada? What did the Almighty mean by this, but that sympathies should be  
awakened in the minds of the British people, and be practically realised, for the  
future welfare of the oppressed and the down-trodden.”^60  
Indeed, Ward’s invocation of the two groups’ status as black colonial laborers  
was both reinforcing and transgressing what historian Seymour Drescher calls the  
“racialization of labor and migration in the British political imagination” in the  
mid-19th century.^61 On the one hand, his appeal grounded black West Indians’  
imperial belonging in their tropical labor, which ambivalently locked them in a  
racially exploitative relationship to the empire. On the other hand, self-emancipat-  
ed people unsettled the racial boundaries of Canadian settler colonialism, which  
by this time was manifested in anti-black protests by white colonists who assert-  
ed exclusive ownership of Canadian land by “thousands of our countrymen of our  
own color.”^62 In light of the racially unsettling nature of black presence in a white  
settler colony, Ward’s definition of black belonging can be seen as a radical act in  
its disruption of the racialized structures of the free labor empire.

COLONIAL MISSIONARIES AND RACIAL STRUCTURES
```

In addition to labor, Ward invoked religious piety—a characteristic believed  
to reside in an ideal colonial subject and thus cited by diverse “black” groups with-  
in the empire as a marker of their British identity.^63 In 1854 Ward proudly  
announced that “the preaching of the gospel was attended with great success  
amongst them \[the self-emancipated in Canada\], and that they were as loyal as any  
of her Majesty’s subjects. The same might be said of the West Indies.”^64 Framing  
the two peoples as equally devout populations despite their past enslavement,  
Ward lent legitimacy to his claim for metropolitan aid.  
Such inter-colonial diasporic identification was further fostered by black West  
Indians within a racially structured colonial missionary apparatus. Rev. Robert  
Gordon, a preacher from Jamaica, forged a common black identity informed by  
the past diasporic experience of enslavement and the current freedom in the  
British Empire as he worked for a mission to the self-emancipated African  
Americans in Canada. The mission, operated by the Colonial Church and School  
Society, was first proposed at a committee meeting in April 1853 and became  
known as the “Fugitive Slave Mission” by 1856. The religious venture had two  
goals: abolition of U.S. slavery and the social uplift of black colonial subjects.^65  
The Fugitive Slave Mission was devised with the hopes that “the spectacle of a  
large body of the \[N\]egro race, elevated in social and religious condition, and  
walking like Christian men in the light of the Gospel” would help effect abolition-  
ist campaigns in the United States.^66 At the same time, the mission was considered  
an endeavor to advance the religious training of fellow British subjects. “Our  
attention,” the society declared, “has been called to the miserable condition of the  
fugitive colored population in our own colony of Canada,” who “as our fellow  
subjects, have a special claim on our regard.”^67  
The Colonial Church and School Society, with many branches dominated by  
women, offered an institutional and ideological frame—albeit a narrow one—for  
developing a common racial identity among African-descended colonial subjects  
in the empire. In the annual report of the year 1856–1857, the period during which  
its West Indian missions went into operation, religious instruction for self-eman-  
cipated people in Canada and “the emancipated \[N\]egroes of the West Indies”  
were identified as two branches of one larger project of “civilizing the African  
race” within the empire.^68 The report set the two groups side by side, pleading for  
“the sympathies of British Christians of the beautiful and now impoverished West  
India islands, where such openings are being made for the labors of the Society;  
of the fugitive slaves also, who are annually seeking the protection of the British  
empire on Canadian soil.”^69  
The society’s mission in Jamaica inspired Gordon to develop an interest in its

Fugitive Slave Mission. He acquainted himself with the society’s officers sta-  
tioned in Jamaica, who may well have informed Rev. Gordon that there was anoth-  
er emancipated population under the instruction of the society. Also, missionary  
publications very likely reached Jamaica and piqued Gordon’s interest in the proj-  
ect, generating in him a sense of common destiny with his fellow subjects in  
Canada. Eventually, Gordon applied for a position in the Fugitive Slave Mission  
and, after successfully passing an interview with the society, he was recommend-  
ed to the Bishop of Huron as a catechist.^70

Rev. Gordon’s identification with self-emancipated people in Canada devel-  
oped within the unequal race relations of the colonial missions. The appointment of  
Gordon to Canada was in accordance with metropolitan whites’ understanding that  
the Fugitive Slave Mission required expertise in “the characteristics of the African  
race” that mostly took on negative connotations, evident in the officers’ statement  
that former slaves were in “the lowest state of ignorance of religion, and even of  
secular knowledge.”^71 Indeed, the society had already appointed white missionar-  
ies with experience in the West Indies and hired women of African descent. Those  
appointed, Rev. M. M. Dillon and a lay missionary named Ballantine, had worked  
in Dominica, the former as rector and the latter as teacher for the Mico Charity in  
charge of instructing “the colored boys.”^72 At Dillon’s request, the positions of

infant school teachers were filled by “two young colored females named Titre,” sis-  
ters who had accompanied Ballantine from Dominica and were then studying at the  
Home and Colonial Institution, the society’s school for the training of missionaries  
to be sent across the empire.^73 Rev. Gordon’s work was set within this doubly hier-  
archical structure of colonial missionary operations, where whites’ sense of  
supremacy over emancipated populations underlined their evangelizing projects;  
and where relocated black subjects worked in a subordinate position to white mis-  
sionaries.

Gordon’s interstitial position was revealed in the remaining records that docu-  
mented his racial identification as well as the inequitable colonial governance. On the  
first day of August 1859, Rev. Gordon delivered a sermon to the “colored citizens of  
London, Canada, and several other places” who gathered at St. Paul’s Cathedral on  
the “the 21st Anniversary of the Emancipation of the black and colored slaves of the  
British West Indies.”^74 Following the tradition of British emancipation celebrations in  
Canada, Gordon urged his audience to celebrate the occasion as fellow beneficiaries  
of freedom along with those in the West Indies, concluding that “it well becomes the  
colored people to consider this day as a Festival; since enjoying here, as they can do  
wherever the British Banner is unfurled, as indicative of territorial possession, the  
blessed privilege of sitting unmolested under their own vine and fig tree, protected as  
well as their white brethren by laws which are impartially administered.”^75

From his perspective as a missionary, the enjoyment of freedom under the  
British flag meant the acceptance of educational and religious instruction at the  
mission, through which his understanding of a common diasporic identity was  
articulated. “I would specially address my colored brethren,” Rev. Gordon exhort-  
ed, “on the necessity of their practically exhibiting their appreciation of, and grat-  
itude for, the efforts which that most estimable Institution, the Colonial Church  
and School Society, are making for their moral, social, and religious advancement,  
through the male and female agents sent to them.”^76 Although expressing a unified  
racial identity with his “colored brethren,” his attachment to the colonial mission-  
ary hierarchy led Gordon to reiterate its racial tenets, patronizingly instructing  
black Canadians to appreciate white evangelists, who “benevolently hold out their  
hands to you,” and to depend on them for moral education because black parents  
were “generally...incapable of religiously instructing \[their\] children.”^77  
As passionate a worker as he was, less than four months after the sermon, the  
society discharged Rev. Gordon from his position due to the “indiscretion” he  
committed, namely collecting funds for a new church building without permission  
from the white missionary officers in Canada and London.^78 Rev. Gordon left  
Canada for the West Indies in late January 1860 and on the eve of his return, he  
penned a letter to the committee in England “pray\[ing\] for the prosperity of the  
Society.”^79  
Censured for bypassing white authorities, Gordon’s departure illustrated the  
asymmetrical power relations on which he hoped to forge a united British identi-  
ty among African diasporic populations. Since black colonial subjecthood was  
embedded in the racial hierarchies of empire, diasporic identities that emerged  
within them consequently faced narrow and constrained realms of formation and  
development. Not only regulated discursively by colonial racial paradigms,  
Gordon’s aspirations for collective improvement were quickly shattered once he  
overstepped the boundaries of colonial missionary rule.

### CONCLUSION

The post-emancipation British Empire enabled diasporic mappings by dis-  
persed freedpeople for political use. Metropolitan abolitionists formulated geogra-  
phies of empire that located formerly enslaved people in Canada along with  
“black” subjects in other regions, ranging from the West Indies to East India. More  
importantly, self-emancipated people from the United States living in Canada  
identified with emancipated West Indians in articulating their “belonging” as  
British colonial subjects. This conceptual connection suggests the significance of  
African diasporic identity for formerly enslaved U.S. African Americans’ forma-  
tion of self. The powerful symbolism of West Indian emancipation in British polit-

ical discourse further enhanced its usefulness as a discursive tool.  
Black refugees’ association with emancipated West Indians should be contex-  
tualized within the complex layers of political and diplomatic relations that shaped  
the mid-19th-century Atlantic World. This era saw an increased divergence of state  
policies regarding slavery, which inspired many African Americans in bondage to  
view enslavement as contingent upon the state or nation in which they resided,  
resulting in flights to “free” territory, in this case Upper Canada. However, mov-  
ing to a “free” space did not guarantee one’s protection from legal proceedings ini-  
tiated from across the border to regain lost “property.” Self-emancipated people’s  
fashioning of a British identity was meant not only to express their appreciation of  
freedom on British soil, but also to secure their tenuous freedom from the inter-  
loping U.S. slave power. In this sense the fugitives’ British identity did not signal  
a complete break from enslavement in the United States, but instead reflected their  
closeness to it, conditioned by a bilateral treaty system that inherently unsettled  
the national border between freedom and slavery.  
In such precarious conditions of freedom, the presence of already emancipat-  
ed African-descended people evoked particular diasporic politics, leading to the  
creation of the “British Negro.” This identity signified government-secured  
freedom and social and political advancement as free subjects. Self-emancipated  
people’s diasporic strategy represented an effort to exploit the British Empire’s  
redefined relationship to slavery and its reframed self-image as a white ruler and  
protector of “freed” darker peoples, a dynamic that was racially inequitable in its  
own distinctive ways. Seeking to make the most of what British freedom could  
offer, self-emancipated African Americans from the United States physically and  
intellectually maneuvered their way through the new political and economic geog-  
raphies of the Atlantic World.

(^42) While the East Indian Company had emancipated its slaves in Malabar in 1836, the Abolition of Slavery Act V  
enacted in 1843 probably heightened abolitionists’ attention to East Indians during this time. On the Abolition of  
Slavery Act, see Nancy Gardner Cassels, “Social Legislation under the Company Raj: The Abolition of Slavery  
Act V 1843,” _South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies_ 11 (July 1988): 59–87.

slavery career as lecturer for the Michigan Liberty Party and later expanded to national lecture circuits. He mar-  
ried Mary Miles in 1848 and a year later published a book-length slave narrative, _The Narrative of the Life and  
Adventures of Henry Bibb, An American Slave_. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, the couple
