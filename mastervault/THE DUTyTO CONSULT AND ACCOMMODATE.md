Realizing Indigenous Rights in International Environmental Law: A Canadian Perspective

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Crown has a duty to consult Aboriginal peoples when
it has either real or constructive knowledge of an Aboriginal
right and title and is contemplating action that might affect
either the right or title. To date, the majority of Canadian
Aboriginal case law has focused on applying the duty to
consult to statutory decisions that could interfere with
domestic Aboriginal or treaty rights. Aboriginal peoples
have an opportunity to transform international decision
making if Canada determines there is a legal requirement to
include indigenous voices when negotiating and ratifying
international agreements, especially those pertaining to
the environment.
Formal legal consultation with indigenous peoples on a
country’s international negotiating position for agreements
that have the potential to impact indigenous rights will be
a significant governance and policy shift. Even though
the Federal Court of Appeal in Hupacasath First Nation v
Canada (Minister of Foreign Affairs) rejected consultation
requirements for the ratification of an international
investment treaty, the negotiation of environmental
agreements has much clearer links to Aboriginal rights. As
well, the Canadian government’s promise to implement
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples (UNDRIP) also has the potential to influence future
court decisions. This proposed legal change is not without
challenges. Given that there are more than 600 recognized
First Nations bands in Canada and many non-status and
urban indigenous populations, as well as Metis and Inuit
peoples, a workable solution for legal consultation for
legislation and other administrative matters should be a
focus of indigenous political organizations as they prepare
for the implementation of UNDRIP in Canada.

INTRODUCTION
Indigenous peoples have faced challenges participating
in the negotiation and development of international law
agreements, which has been demonstrated in Canada in
a recent claim, brought by the Hupacasath First Nation
(HFN). The HFN was attempting to push the consultation
envelope as the First Nation sought to provide indigenous
peoples in Canada with the ability to shape international
policy on matters that may impact their rights. Hupacasath
First Nation v Canada (Minister of Foreign Affairs) was the
first case in Canada where a court was asked to determine
whether there was a constitutional obligation to consult
prior to ratification of an international investment treaty.1
The Federal Court of Appeal determined that there is no
duty on the government to consult a particular First Nations
community prior to the ratification of an international
investment treaty that Canada had negotiated with China,
as the potential adverse impacts on Aboriginal rights was

deemed speculative. This decision can be seen as a narrow
precedent, as it only concerns one international agreement
and the potential impacts of this agreement on the rights of
a particular First Nations community. Hupacasath FC was
a difficult test case to expand consultation rights, given
the uncertainties of linking impacts from future unknown
foreign investments to adverse impacts to the specific
Aboriginal and treaty rights of a particular First Nation.
While the impacts of an international investment
agreement may be determined speculative by a Canadian
court, a stronger precedent-setting case may involve
challenging the lack of consultation when Canada
negotiates environmental agreements, such as those
regarding climate change, where a lack of negotiated
stringent targets has the potential to impact the ability to
hunt, fish and gather, activities that are clearly protected
in the many treaties that blanket Canada. As well, formal
consultation with indigenous peoples prior to acceding
to biodiversity protocols, which aim to provide a process
for access to and benefit sharing of traditional knowledge,
would seem to be a prudent government action. Unlike
the court’s decision in Hupacasath FC, a future court may
not be able to easily dismiss a claim that consultation was
owed prior to the accession to or ratification of agreements
such as the Paris Agreement on climate change or the
Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity,
as there are clearer causal connections between these
international environmental agreements and Aboriginal
rights and interests. Governments, such as Canada,
that are considering the policy and legal implications
of implementing UNDRIP2 should be informed on
the breadth of the declaration’s potential impacts for
international decision making. UNDRIP implementation
would build a stronger case that indigenous participation
in the development of international agreements may be
required, both in Canada, through its unique constitutional
requirements, and internationally.

THE DUTY TO CONSULT AND
ACCOMMODATE
The relationship between the Crown (federal and provincial
governments of Canada) and Aboriginal3 peoples has
rapidly changed over the past decade, due in part to the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in Haida
Nation,4 which applied the constitutional protections set

CIGI Papers no. 109 — October 2016
out in section 35 of Canada’s Constitution5 in a procedural
duty to consult. The duty to consult is triggered “when the
Crown has knowledge, real or constructive, of the potential
existence of an Aboriginal right or title and contemplates
conduct that might adversely affect it.”6 In Haida Nation,
the SCC clarified that the source of “the government’s
duty to consult with Aboriginal peoples and accommodate
their interests is grounded in the honour of the Crown. The
honour of the Crown is always at stake in its dealings with
Aboriginal peoples.”7 Known as a three-part test, the duty
is applied when the following are present:
• there is knowledge by the Crown of an established or
asserted Aboriginal or treaty right;
• Crown conduct is contemplated; and
• there is the potential for an adverse effect of the
proposed Crown conduct on an established or
asserted Aboriginal or treaty right.
The majority of Canadian Aboriginal case law has focused
on applying the duty to consult to statutory decisions
that could interfere with Aboriginal and/or treaty rights.
Examples of statutory decisions that have been examined
by the courts for adequacy of consultation include the
issuance of approvals for mineral, oil and gas extraction or
forest management undertakings. There is still debate over
whether the duty extends more broadly to law making.
Although the SCC has not yet ruled on whether the duty
to consult applies to legislation, there is a lower court
decision that recognized that the duty can be triggered
by the introduction of a bill into Parliament, such as
introduction of an omnibus bill that changed federal
environmental assessment laws.8 The SCC’s decision in Rio
Tinto Alcan Inc. v Carrier Sekani Tribal Council did provide
some guidance as to whether the duty to consult extends
beyond individual resource extraction projects that impact
Aboriginal territory. According to the SCC, “government
action is not confined to decisions or conduct which have
an immediate impact on lands and resources. A potential
for adverse impact suffices. Thus, the duty to consult
extends to ‘strategic, higher level decisions’ that may have
an impact on Aboriginal claims and rights.”9
The decision in Rio Tinto leads to the question: are
international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement,

“strategic high-level decisions” that impact Aboriginal
rights? Canada has acknowledged in its duty to consult
guidelines that the duty may be triggered by international
agreements.10 As well, there are provisions in numerous
modern treaties that require consultation before Canada
consents to be bound by a new international treaty that
would give rise to new international legal obligations that
may adversely affect a right of a First Nation.11

HUPACASATH FIRST NATION v CANADA
Similar to the transformative role Canada’s Aboriginal
peoples have carved out to shape resource development on
traditional territories, there is an opportunity to influence
international decision making if it is determined that there
is a legal requirement to include indigenous voices when
negotiating and ratifying international environmental
agreements. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, the first
case that sought to have these procedural rights applied to
the international sphere was not in the area of environment.
In their memorandum of fact and law, the HFN set out some
of their asserted Aboriginal rights, including Aboriginal
title. The HFN claimed that their ability to exercise these
rights would be impacted because their self-government
powers would be constrained if the investment treaty with
China was ratified. All the rights enumerated in the HFN’s
memorandum were tied to land use, conservation and
protection of resources:
• the right to harvest, manage, protect and use fish,
wildlife, and other resources in HFN’s traditional
territory in priority to all other users, subject only to
conservation;
• the right to have access to exclusive and preferred
areas to harvest or to use fish, wildlife and other
resources in their traditional territory;
• the right to protect the habitats that sustain fish,
wildlife and other resources which the Hupacasath
have a right to harvest; and

10 “Officials should assess whether provisions in land claim agreements
or self-government agreements require that consultation take place in
relation to legally binding international instruments. Second, officials
must determine whether legislation requires Canada to consult on
international instruments. Officials should seek legal advice, which
will support the broader departmental or agency assessments and
decision-making processes.“ Canada, Minister of the Department of
