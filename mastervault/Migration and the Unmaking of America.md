Migration and the

?/wmaking of America
PHIL BELLFY
ANY DISCUSSION of the "Making of North America" must include
some discussion of how the existing "North America" was unmade?it
must be explained how "free land" became available to new immigrants

from Europe. In 1492, the Native people of the Western Hemisphere
had a multitude of thriving civilizations, and in the north, a trading

network that stretched from at least central Mexico to the Great Lakes.

Thousands of autonomous, distinct political nations were extant, and
people spoke hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages. Tzvetlan
Todorov, in his book, The Conquest of America, relates the story of the
Unmaking of Meso-America quite eloquently, most often in the words
of Columbus, Cortez, and others, so that story need not be retold here.1
Also, the depredations of the early New Englanders and the shameful
removal of the southeast tribes are histories that are also relatively easy
to reconstruct.

THE ANISHNABEG
A much less well known history is the subject of this paper?the
unsuccessful unmaking of the indigenous civilizations of the Great Lakes

region, specifically, those people we usually refer to as the Chippewa
(or Ojibway), the Ottawa^ and the Potawatomi. Less often, these three
tribes are collectively referred to as The Three Fires Confederacy. In
their language, they refer to themselves as the Anishnabeg (with variant

spellings and dialect differences) which is the term I will use in this
essay. While meanings in English vary, most definitions of the word
encompass the concepts of "Original Man" or simply "The People," as
is true of great numbers of self-named indigenous tribes.2

As is the case with most Indigenous peoples, the land was not sepa
rable from who they were, in both the cultural and the physical sense.

True to this imperative, the Anishnabeg viewed the land as part of
them?and they as part of it. The Biblical precepts of "Be fruitful, and

multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it," were, and are, as

foreign to them as were the concepts of monotheism and a vengeful
deity. This is not to say that the Native people of the region had no
concepts of what we might now call private ownership; but certainly the
concept of ownership did not extend to the natural resources of the area.

The Anishnabeg did authorize families to access the resources of
certain delimited winter hunting grounds, and there certainly were inter

tribal wars fought over overlapping claims to territory. But in these
cases, the key was access, not ownership, and the decisions governing
mira-tribal access were arrived at through consensus. It was very much
a part of the ethos to grant access to others based on their need and the
bounty of the area. We will see how this philosophy is later applied to

the Europeans.
At the time of post-1492 contact, the Anishnabeg occupied much of
the northern Great Lakes from what is now eastern Ontario to Lake

Winnipeg and south into Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.3 By
1776, they had expanded their territory south into what is now northern
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, occupying land which completely surrounded

all of the Great Lakes with the exception of the areas south of Lake
Ontario (occupied by the Iroquois Confederacy). Many contact-era tribes
of the region were as decimated by disease and warfare as their tradi
tional ways of life were threatened by the arrival of Europeans and the
fur trade regime's erosion of their self-sufficiency. While they too suf
fered, the Anishnabeg managed to expand into territories abandoned by
others or gained through warfare (notably pushing the Iroquois back to
the shores of Lake Ontario and taking control of those areas the Iroquois
conquered during their campaigns to control the area's fur trade).

PONTIAC'S "WAR"
As the waning Iroquois influence in the western Great Lakes was
taken up by the Anishnabeg, and the French trading regime gave way to
British interests in 1760, the Anishnabeg were faced with another threat
to their homelands and sovereignty. The trading regime of the French

was much more generous than that of the British, and soon after the
British took over the Great Lakes trade, the Ottawa chief Pontiac and his

allies set out to confront British power and trade practices in the Spring

of 1763. Often mislabeled as a rebellion or a conspiracy, Pontiac's
action should be more honestly referred to as "a vigorous defense of the

homeland." While the history books refer to Pontiac's "War" as a fail
ure, from the perspective of the Anishnabeg, the campaign was a success.

Pontiac built on an earlier "Pan-Indian" alliance formed under the
Iroquois, which was active from the early 1700s to mid-century. It was

successful in bringing together an impressive array of tribes which?
despite the failure to continue the siege of Detroit?forced the British to
reestablish the more liberal trade policies of the French. Pontiac and his
allies essentially forced the British to recognize that the area's Native
people were very much in control of their homelands and had the power
to pretty much dictate the terms of trade.

While the French were quite liberal in their trade policy and rather
inclined to integrate themselves into the aboriginal way of life, the Brit
ish saw the Native people as only as the source of the fur trade wealth
that the area still held in the late eighteenth century. The British recog
nized that maintaining the indigenous people in their homelands meant
that the fur trade regime would continue, at least until the fur-bearing

animals were trapped to scarcity. (The policy of the French seemed to
be more toward sustainability and integration.) The British attempts to
maintain the fur trade by keeping the expansionist Colonial settlers on

the Atlantic side of the Appalachian range?one of the "long train of
abuses and usurpations"?led to the American Revolution.4
Despite Pontiac's success and British recognition of the area's Indig
enous power base, the threat of settler expansion soon focused the
Anishnabeg's attention once again on the defense of their homelands.
While not really trusting the British to defend their interests, they saw
the "Americans" as the much greater threat. "Pontiac's Rebellion" had
eliminated the worst of the British threat and at the onset of the Revolu

tionary War, the area's Native people joined with their former British
enemies to counter what they perceived as a much greater threat?the
Americans and their lust for land. The French integrated; the British
accommodated; but the Americans seemed determined to take their land,

killing any who stood in their way. The Anishnabeg readily understood
that American colonial expansion meant a loss of their homelands and a
way of life that had become inexorably tied to the fur trade.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
At the onset of the Revolutionary War, Native people once again
launched a vigorous defense of their homeland. While it is true that
many tribes decided that this was a "fight among brothers" and re
mained neutral, the overwhelming majority of Native people who chose

to fight did so on the side of the British. Many Anishnabeg, former

allies of Pontiac, fought the American colonists in battles far to the east
of their homelands. And while the British did surrender to the colonists,

the Anishnabeg were never defeated. In fact, in a tacit recognition of
United States weakness after the war, the British continued to occupy
their posts in the western Great Lakes, although ostensibly on land
"ceded" to the United States. This "cession" was not recognized by the
area's Native people. In fact, some have claimed that the British were
forced to maintain their posts as a hedge against an "Indian uprising,"
threatened in retaliation for the British capitulation and abandonment of

their Native allies in the 1783 Treaty of Paris.5 Although the British
proposal to establish the Northwest Territories as an "Indian Buffer
State" between the Americans in the east and the British-claimed terri

tory west of the Mississippi was soundly rejected by the Americans, the

Native people of the area viewed the proposal as a treacherous sell-out
of their interests.6

From the perspective of the Americans, the Native people of the
western Great Lakes were still loyal British subjects. Of course, they
were nothing of the sort?at the end of the Revolutionary War, they still
held the balance of power in the region and both the United States and
Great Britain fought over their loyalty. The disastrous defeats by Native
defenders of Harmar in 1790 and Saint Clair in 1791, showed the fierce
resistance which met the American military forays into the Great Lakes.
And, as the British gave only minimal and grudging military aid to their

former allies during this period, the Anishnabeg can be seen as essen
tially autonomous actors, living in, and defending their homeland.
The 1795 Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation was an attempt
by the British and American governments to resolve their differences in

the western Great Lakes region. (The Treaty is usually referred to as
Jay's Treaty, or the Jay Treaty, named after its chief United States
negotiator, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Jay.) For the pur

poses of this essay, Article III of the Jay Treaty is significant. The
Article sets out the terms whereby "His Majesty's subjects ... citizens
of the United States, and . . . Indians dwelling on either side of the said
boundary" can freely carry out "cross-border" trade without the imposi
tion of import duties (the British, while agreeing to abandon their posts
in territory claimed by the United States, still hoped to profit from the
area's fur trade activity). By delineating the three major actors of the

area?the British, the Americans, and the "Indians"?Jay's Treaty rec
ognized the power and distinct character of the area's Native people
without a regard for the border separating the two European powers.

Also embedded in the wording is a tacit recognition of the control over
the territory that Native people exercised, putting them on a par with the

other (British and American) interests in the area?Native people still
held the balance of power. It is also significant that the United States
dealt with Native people by signing treaties with them?an international
diplomatic necessity when the signatories are sovereign nations, not
fellow citizens.
Jay's Treaty, while at least temporarily keeping the peace between the
United States and Great Britain, did little to alleviate the Native people's
fear of American aggression. In fact, Jay's Treaty was being negotiated
as the United States Army, under "Mad" Anthony Wayne, was engaging

Native warriors at the Battle of the Fallen Timbers. This minor battle
served as the impetus to the controversial 1795 Treaty of Greenville,
which (at least in the eyes of the United States government) ceded a
small portion of "Indian Country" in Ohio and opened the door to fur
ther expansion and land cessions. Of course, the majority of Native
people rejected the authority of the Greenville chiefs to sign any land
cession, holding to the prevailing agreement that any land cession re
quired a consensus from all area tribes, a condition well nigh impossible
to meet, which was, of course, its intent.
One of those who did not accept the cessions of the Treaty of Greenville

was the Shawnee chief Tecumseh who steadfastly maintained that any
decision to cede land must be arrived at by consensus. The War of 1812

was in large part "Tecumseh's War" and the Native people of the area
vigorously supported Tecumseh's efforts and his efforts to re-forge a
Pan-Indian alliance to resist the encroachments of the American colo
nists moving into the Ohio River Valley, traditional Shawnee territory.
Native people from the entire Northwest Territories were with Tecumseh's
brother Tenskwatawa at Prophetstown, including a considerable number

of Ottawa, Chippewa, and Potawatomi.7

THE WAR OF 1812
The Native people were engaged in the War of 1812 for the express
purpose of defending their homeland from a settler invasion which would
obviously alter their way of life and overrun their territories. A British

military official put it this way: "The Great Spirit smiles on our just
cause, but frowns on that of the deceitful Americans because they have

cruelly oppressed you [and if they win] you will be gradually driven
beyond the setting sun.8

When Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in 1814,
several Anishnabeg warriors from as far away as Sault Ste Marie fell
with him, and with his death, the War was essentially over. Again, the
British and the Americans forged a peace, and despite assurances by the
British to the contrary, the Native people of the area were pretty much
abandoned by them. Instead of supporting their resistance, the British
told the Native people to "be on good terms with our neighbors, the Big
Knives" and treat the American traders with respect.9
As was the case after the American Revolution, and despite the Brit
ish capitulation, the Native people of the upper Great Lakes were not

defeated by United States forces and indeed both United States and
British forces recognized that Native people still held the balance of
power in the region. Consequently, both sides established a regime of
giving "presents" to the Native people of the region in efforts to wrest
the Native's loyalty from one side to cement it firmly to the other. The

efforts were not to the advantage of either side. The Native people
simply took advantage of the rivalry of the United States and Britain by
collecting presents from both sides while continuing to complain to the
British that the Americans were all?as they feared?overrunning their

homelands.10

REMOVAL AND THE 1836 TREATY OF DETROIT
After the War of 1812, the Native people of the entire eastern Ameri
can territory faced another serious threat?that of Removal. Although
ruled to be illegal by the United States Supreme Court, President Jack
son defied the Court and began the removal of the Native people from

the Southeast in 1836, an event forever remembered as the Trail of
Tears. Other removals took place throughout the territory east of the
Mississippi and the peoples of the Old Northwest were not exempted
form this brutal process. The United States did not gain control over the
upper Great Lakes until well after the War of 1812, a process begun in
Sault Ste Marie in 1820. It should be noted that although the 1820 Sault

Treaty was with the United States government, Native people who re

sided on the British side of the international border were instrumental in

the treaty process, notably the "British Chief, Shinwauk," who signed
the United States treaty with his English pseudonym, "Augustin Bart."
This 1820 Treaty did not put an end to the Native people's animosity
toward the Americans, however, and they continued to harass American

surveyors until at least 1825.11 And, it should be noted, the British

continued to give presents to all Native people whose tribes supported
the British during the Revolutionary war and the War of 1812, an action
condemned by the Americans as they too gave presents to all area
Native people without ascertaining whether they lived on purported Ca
nadian or American soil.12 In fact, residency in the Upper Saint Mary's
River area (near Sault Ste Marie) was made even more problematic by
the inability of the United States and Great Britain to agree on the
border through the area.13

During this entire period the Native people of the area continued to
adhere to the pre-war precept of ceding land only through consensus, as
scrutiny of the signatories to the land cession treaties confirms. Major
land cession treaties were signed by a very large number of representa
tives from virtually all area tribes. And treaties of importance to the
Anishnabeg of the Lake Huron borderlands were also signed by at least
fifty Native leaders from both sides of the international border.14 This
supra-national approach to treaty signing only bolsters the argument that

the area's Native people were acting in a manner befitting sovereign

people.

Yet despite the obvious solidarity, the power of the American govern

ment was growing and the support (and presents) given to the area's
Native people by the British diminished in proportion. By the early
1830s it was evident to both United States and British authorities that

the military power of the Anishnabeg was no longer a threat. In other

words, the British recognized that American power in the region had
grown to such a point that even a combined Native/British force was no
longer a match for the Americans. It is at this point that the British
began a slow retreat from policies that were objectionable to the Ameri

cans, and the Americans began to impose on the Anishnabeg the re
moval policies that were enacted in 1830.
As settlers from the east continued rushing into the upper Great Lakes,
the lives of the Native people?based on hunting, fishing, trapping, and
gathering?became severely disrupted. The pressure to cede land rose in
the same proportion. It was President Monroe (in 1825) who suggested

that the Native people of the upper Great Lakes be removed to lands
west of the Mississippi to "shield them from impending doom [and]
promote their welfare and happiness."15 The first part of this statement
was certainly quite evident to the area's indigenous population, although
the second part was, no doubt, met with increasing skepticism.

Due to geography and history, the Anishnabeg were not faced with
the choice of starvation or removal?they had a third option; moving to

the "British" side of the border. As we have already seen in the pattern
of treaty signings, the Native people of the area viewed the border as an
issue between the Americans and the British; the border itself was of no
concern to them. Mass movement of Native peoples to areas north of the

border was scarcely new. Even before the Revolution, Native people
from the Northeast fled to the protection of the authorities north of what
were the original thirteen colonies.16 Following the Revolutionary War,

the Mohawk leader Joseph Brant led a sizable portion of his Iroquois
people to a large reserve on both sides of the Grand River in southern
Ontario. Many other tribal groups left for Canada as well, including
some Ojibway, Ottawa, Potawatomi, Munsee, Delaware (Lenni Lenap?),
and Wyandot peoples from the Great Lakes area.17
Part of the impetus for moving to Canada was the changing British
policy of presents distribution after the American Revolution. The Brit
ish recognized two separate categories of "Indians": those "resident" in
Canada and those who were "visiting" from the United States. As the
cost of supplying the "visiting Indians" rose, the British began to en
courage these Native people to establish themselves in Canada perma
nently in order to continue receiving their "presents."18 It should be
noted that the distribution of presents was not one-sided; Native people
continued to supply the British with food and with furs. Still it is true
that Native people had become more and more dependent upon Euro
pean goods long before the Revolution.
By the 1830s complex pushes and pulls affected the movement of
Native people throughout the Great Lakes?the push of United States
Removal policies and the pull of British "presents." As the United States
pressed its removal policy, the British in Canada adopted a less severe
policy of establishing model villages in areas where the Native people
lived, with the cost of establishing these villages paid for through sale of
lands ceded to the Crown.19 The result in Canada was not the wholesale

removal of Native people as was seen in the United States, but the
Native people of Canada were nonetheless dispossessed of their land as

well.

So while in the United States we see a rather small number of large
reservations, Canada established a very large number of generally much
smaller reservations. Taking Ontario and Michigan as examples, we see
that Ontario has 134 small reserves while Michigan has 11 reservations.

There was one notable exception to this general policy in the Upper
Great Lakes. In 1836, the British authorities proposed movement to
Manitoulin Island in the north Georgian Bay as a kind of "Canadian

Oklahoma."20 The plan was abandoned as white settlers continued to
press for the farmlands of Manitoulin Island to be turned over to them.
The language of the 1862 land cession treaty tells the tale: "it has been
deemed expedient... to assign to the Indians now upon the island cer
tain specified portions ... and to sell the other portions thereof fit for
cultivation to settlers."21

Back on the American side of the border, the settlers continued to
press for the removal of the Great Lakes Anishnabeg. One example
from Michigan is instructive in this regard. Before the Michigan Terri
tory could be considered for statehood, it understandably had to secure a

large cession of land from the Native people. The result of this land
grab was the 1836 Treaty of Washington, through which area Anishnabeg
ceded what came to be the northwestern two-thirds of the Lower Penin

sula and the eastern third of the Upper Peninsula?a sizable portion of
the resulting State. This 1836 Treaty was not negotiated as a "removal"
treaty even though the 1830 Removal Act was still the law of the land
(quite literally).

As is the case of all treaties, after they are negotiated, the United
States Senate must ratify them. The Senate strongly supported removal,
so they amended the treaty to allow for occupancy of the reservations
set aside by the treaty to be only for a period of five years "unless the
United States shall grant them permission to remain on said lands for a
longer period."22 The amended treaty further stipulated that at any time

during that five-year period "as soon as the said Indians desire it, a
deputation shall be sent to the southwest of the Missouri River, there to
select a suitable place for the final settlement of said Indians.. .. When
the Indians wish it, the United States shall remove them."23

The Anishnabeg of this 1836 treaty area were outraged that their
treaty had been so amended without their consultation or agreement, but
it passed the Senate with the amendments intact, and thus became (as is
true of all treaties) the Supreme Law of the Land. But the Anishnabeg

recognized several ways to resist removal within the context of the
amended Treaty language. The first was the provision that allowed the

government to grant the Native people "permission to remain on said
lands for a longer period," permission which they immediately sought.

Other resistance centered around the two phrases "as soon as the said
Indians desire it" and "when the Indians wish it." Simply said, the
"Indians" vowed to never "desire" to travel to Kansas to select their
"new homelands" nor did they ever "wish" to remove.

THE END OF REMOVAL AND THE 1855 TREATY

OF WASHINGTON

This is not to say that all Native people from Michigan successfully
resisted removal, but of the approximate 8,000 people who were "en
couraged" to move, only about 650 were actually removed to lands west
of the Mississippi (most of these were Potawatomi from southern Michi
gan).24 And so, due to Anishnabeg resistance, the government was con
tinually obliged to grant them permission to remain in Michigan for a
series of five-year periods. This resistance lasted until 1855, when a new
treaty with the area Anishnabeg was signed. This 1855 Treaty finally,
and formally, reversed the government's removal policy. Instead, the
1855 Treaty provided for "allotments," presaging the government's 1887
Dawes Act provisions which required individual Native people to select
a portion of reserve lands to be held as "private property" after a twenty

five year period. (The 1855 Treaty "gave" 80 acres to each head of
household, with smaller acreage for other tribal members, and the time
period was only ten years.25) As was true of removal, the Anishnabeg of

Michigan found yet another way to resist this land-grab?they simply
refused to select their parcels, or, when the government assigned them
to parcels, they refused to take possession.
Anishnabeg resistance to white attempts to dispossess them of their
land thus took several forms. The successful military resistance of Pontiac,
Little Turtle, Tecumseh, and others saw to it that the government could
not force the Anishnabeg from their lands; the illegal Removal policy

was also largely unsuccessful, as was the shameful allotment process.
Simple geography also played an important role in the Anishnabeg's
refusal to be dispossessed. Canada was (and is) a potent lure?many
Native people, resisting removal or military threat, simply went across
the border to live until the threat abated, then returned. The value of
their northern lands to settlers also played a role in their resistance. The

lands set aside for them west of the Mississippi were generally more
desirable than the lands they occupied in the Upper Midwest, so as time

passed, the government found that many of the lands to which they
hoped to remove Native people were already occupied by white set
tlers?hence the 1855 treaty. And so, the Native people remained.

MODERN TREATY RIGHTS
There is one last thing to be explored and that is a brief discussion of
treaties generally, and two Upper Great Lakes treaties specifically. The

United States Constitution recognized treaties as the Supreme Law of
the Land, and, in this context it is not often remembered that treaties are

international agreements signed between two sovereign nations. Thus,
the treaties signed by Native people and the United States or Canadian
governments cannot be viewed as simply how the more powerful settler
governments imposed their will on the hapless natives. The treaties
must?as both United States and Canadian courts have affirmed?be
viewed as documents that bind both parties to the provisions as they are
set out in the treaty. Put another way, while most everyone would agree
that these treaties set out the Native people's relationship to the land and
resources of the land, few recognize that these treaties also delineate the
settler government's relationship to the land and restrictions to settler's
access to the resources now shared with the indigenous people.
Jay's Treaty thus recognized three distinct political actors in North

America?Canada, the United States, and the "Indian" Nations. As Na
tive people signed hundreds of other treaties, international law recog
nizes each signer nation as a sovereign power. "Land cession" treaties
are agreements whereby both parties agree on how the land and its
resources are to be shared. This is, of course, the traditional way that
Native people viewed the land and its resources. Both United States and
Canadian Courts have ruled that as the politically weaker and numeri
cally smaller parties to the treaties, the intent and understanding of the
Native signatories must take precedence over the often self-serving in
terpretation by the dominant settler governments. Over the years the

United States Supreme Court upheld virtually all United States/Native
treaties and have indeed recognized the rights of Native people to the
land and/or resources as set out in the treaties?and as Native people
themselves have demonstrated how their long-dead signatories viewed
them. The alternative, of course, is that the treaties are not valid legal
documents and the rights granted to the settler governments are there

fore equally invalid. That is, in the case of so-called land cession trea
ties, the land (and its resources) is still legally "Indian land" and the
settlers have no rights to be there?they are essentially squatters. The
new Canadian Constitution and Charter of Rights (as seen by Canadian
Supreme Court rulings) recognizes the equality of rights enshrined by

both aboriginal people and by the settler governments in treaties and
other agreements.
Many treaties in the Upper Great Lakes were signed by Native people
who represented all affected Native people, whether the treaty was ne
gotiated with the United States or Canadian government, and whether
representatives lived on one side or the other of Canada's border with

the United States. Three treaties?the 1836 Canadian and United States

treaties mentioned above, and the Canadian 1850 Huron-Robinson
Treaty?serve as illustrations. The 1836 Canadian Treaty created a terri
tory much like Oklahoma on Manitoulin Island; the 1836 United States
treaty was the land cession treaty which essentially allowed Michigan to

be admitted to the Union; and the Canadian 1850 treaty ceded a vast
tract of land in northern Ontario. The Native people who negotiated and
signed these treaties were chosen by the Native community with little
regard to whether or not these representatives were "Canadian" or "Ameri
can" Indians?they simply chose the best people from their Nation.

One last comparison is instructive. The 1836 United States/Native
treaty established that "The Indians stipulate for the right of hunting on

the lands ceded, with the other usual privileges of occupancy, until the
time the land is required for settlement."26 The 1850 Huron-Robinson
Treaty likewise established that the government "agrees ... to allow the

said chiefs and their tribes the full and free privilege to hunt over

the territory now ceded by them, and to fish in the waters

thereof... excepting such portions of the said territory as may from
time to time be sold or leased to individuals or companies of individuals
and occupied by them."27
The consequences are unmistakable. In both cases, vast tracts of the

ceded territories have never been "settled" by whites; they are now
designated as State or Federal forests (in the United States) or Crown
lands (in Canada). (It is true, however that timber and other resources

have been stripped from these lands, and in many cases the land re
verted back to the settler governments for failure to pay the property
taxes). Still, in both the United States and in Canada, area Native people
have had their rights to the natural recourses of the land recognized by
the Courts, notably as they relate to fishing rights. While originally a
"fishing rights" case, a recent agreement between the United States, the

State of Michigan, and five tribes organized in the 1836 Treaty area
recognizes not only their right to a share of the fish resources of the
Treaty waters, but a recognition of the Anishnabeg right to "hunt, fish,
and gather" in the ceded territory.28 A recent (September 2000) confer

ence held in Sault Ste Marie, Ontario, organized by those tribes in the
Huron-Robinson Treaty area of northern Ontario, was held to formulate
plans to and solidify support for using treaty rights to access the exten
sive natural resources of northern Ontario.

The Anishnabeg people of the Upper Great Lakes were never de
feated militarily, nor were they passive victims of settler depredations.

They have engaged in active resistance to the usurpations of lawless
immigrant groups (and their "law-abiding" governments) for hundreds

of years. Their survival?and occupancy and use of their traditional
homelands?is a testament to their success. Their continued struggle to
retain their diminished land-base and to exercise their rights to the area's

natural resources is a celebration of their vitality and will to survive.
They may be divided by a border?a line on a map?and they may live
in relatively isolated communities throughout what was once their vast
homeland, but the Anishnabeg were never vanquished, never dispersed.
While it is true that it is a struggle to assert a sense of national unity in
the face of two stronger hegemonic powers, they survive with a strong
sense of unity and a persistent sense of being Anishnabeg despite centu
ries of assault by settler peoples. They refuse to be unmade.
