THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

IN JAMES BAY, CANADA
The Cree Tallymen Speak Out
GAIL WHITEMAN
Koueraam acnooi or Management, nrasmus university

Although there has been a tremendous amount of past and future development in the James

Bay region of northern Canada, there has been very little empirical research that examined

the impact of economic development on Cree tallymen, who are the senior grassroots man

agers of this vulnerable ecosystem. This oversight is particularly important because the
region is currently facing the possibility of additional large-scale hydroelectric develop
ment and there is no existing baseline information on past impacts on Cree tallymen. In
addition, tallymen continue to have important cultural significance to the Cree Nation and
also broader significance to the field of sustainable management. This article attempts to fill

this gap by providing ethnographic research on the impact of past development on Cree tal
lymen from the perspectives of the tallymen themselves. The author also draws implications
for environmental impact assessments in the region and, more broadly, for the future study of

ecologically embedded managers such as the Cree tallymen.

No wonder we want to keep our land and love our land. That's how we survive—from
the land.

—A Cree elder and tallyman

On February 7, 2002, the provincial government of Québec and the Grand
Council of the Crees of James Bay entered into an agreement giving Cree consent

to Hydro-Québec's proposed Eastmain hydroelectric project and the diversion of
the Rupert River in exchange for $3.5 billion in Canadian currency (U.S.$2.27 bil
lion) over 50 years.1 Despite agreement at the Grand Council and local chief level,

there was a significant portion of the local Cree population (31%) and several
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that opposed the project.2 Currently, the
project is at the environmental impact assessment stage, which will be completed
in 2004.

This is not the first economic development project in the region. In the 1970s,

James Bay became famous as the site of one of the world's first mega-dams, the
James Bay Project. Hydroelectric development was quickly followed by economic
development in minerals, forestry, and tourism. But the region is also called Eeyou

Estchee—the people's land—and has been inhabited by the James Bay Cree for at
least 5,000 years (Feit, 1995). Deep cold, followed by a short growing season, are
the dominant environmental factors of this ecosystem (Aber & Melillo, 1991). Un

predictable population dynamics are a common characteristic and inappropriate

resource decisions can result in sudden ecological collapse (Resilience Network,

1997).
Managers in James Bay are not restricted to corporate types. Within this envi
ronment, a number of local Indigenous managers grapple daily with its extreme yet

vulnerable ecosystem. Notably, the Cree have a sustainable cultural approach to
managing their local ecology (Berkes, 1995, 1998, 1999). Cree tallymen—senior
hunters and trappers—are the key grassroots leaders in charge of this sustainable

approach to management (Whiteman & Cooper, 2000). Tallymen are in charge of
traditional pursuits such as hunting, trapping, and fishing within specified areas
called traplines that cover the region.
Although there has been a tremendous amount of past and future development,

there has been very little empirical research that examined the impact of this eco

nomic development on Cree tallymen. This oversight is particularly important
because tallymen continue to have important cultural significance to the Cree and

also broader significance to the field of sustainable management (Whiteman &
Cooper, 2000). This article attempts to fill this gap by providing ethnographic
research on the impact of past development on Cree tallymen from the perspectives

of the tallymen themselves. The proposed expansion of hydroelectric development
also adds practical urgency and relevance to this information because it can provide

important yet missing baseline information for the environmental impact assess
ment process.
My article is organized as follows. First, I provide background information on
the James Bay Cree and economic development in the region, including a review of

the literature that has examined the sociocultural impacts on the Cree in general.
Then, I describe my ethnographic study and present research findings. Next, I dis
cuss implications of these impacts for the Cree tallymen, particularly in light of the

proposed James Bay hydroelectric expansion. Finally, I draw some broader impli
cations for the field of sustainable management.
BACKGROUND:

THE JAMES BAY CREE

James Bay is a beautiful, subarctic region with many lakes and enormous

powerful rivers. It sits at the bottom of the larger Hudson's Bay in Canada's no

ern region. The Cree Nation of eastern James Bay is composed of approximate

12,000 aboriginal people who live in or near nine permanent village communit

The region is divided into 291 traplines, which are designated family huntin

grounds (Cree Trappers' Association [CTA], 1996). Traplines range in size from

approximately 230 to several thousand square kilometers; the average trapline s

is 1,200 square kilometers (Feit, 1985)—larger than many cities in size. A tallym

manages each trapline, although other trappers and hunters (usually family m

bers) also use the trapline, typically after gaining permission from the tallyma

Despite its vulnerability to ecosystem collapse, the Cree have successfully liv
within this vulnerable and harsh ecosystem for at least 5,000 years. As Francis

Morantz (1983) explain, the Cree developed both a technology and social orga
zation that was suited to the demands of land surrounding them. Instead of ch

ing or attempting to control variability in the natural environment, the Cree learn

to adapt successfully despite such extremes (Berkes 1995, 1999). To do so, th

Cree rely extensively on traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) as a cultu

framework for management (Berkes, 1999). TEK has been defined as "a cumu

lative body of knowledge and beliefs, handed down through the generations by c

tural transmission, about the relationship of living beings (including humans) wit

one another and with their environment" (Berkes, 1995, p. 100). TEK is differen

from most Western conceptualizations of management in that it views the earth an

its many entities as alive and interactive, with humans as just one of many ec
system members (Deloria, 1992).

Cree tallymen, the senior hunters who are in charge of each trapline, are th

key grassroots leaders of this management approach. In a previously publishe

ethnographic study of the Cree tallymen, my findings indicated that the tallyman

approach to management was ecologically embedded, a dimension that strongl
guided the sustainability of their management practice (Whiteman & Cooper,

2000). My fieldwork indicated that Cree tallymen were ecologically embedded a

managers in that they personally identified with the land; adhered to beliefs of eco

logical respect, reciprocity, and caretaking; actively gathered firsthand ecologic

information; and were physically located in their local ecosystem for extensiv
periods of time. A key managerial practice of Cree tallymen was described as
"management by walking outside."

Overall, the tallymen's ecologically embedded knowledge, beliefs, and practic

formed the basis for their cultural legitimacy as leaders and decision makers abo

local natural resource management. Although most Cree shared many of the tall

men's ecologically embedded beliefs, few had such ongoing and in-depth know

edge or daily management experience with the local ecology. This was particular

true for Cree who worked in the villages in more "Westernized" jobs at the ban
council or school.

This earlier article also suggested that the Cree tallymen's approach may be an
interesting model for sustainable management by other non-Indigenous business
managers, an area that warranted future empirical study. However, with continued

pressure from economic development, the tallymen's approach may be signifi
cantly compromised.
BACKGROUND:

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN JAMES BAY
James Bay is a place of wilderness. It is also a place of increasingly aggressive
economic development. The first recorded meeting between the Cree and Europe
ans was in 1611 when Henry Hudson wintered in James Bay (Francis & Morantz,
1983). However, the environment was harsh for outsiders and the fur trade did not
start in James Bay until the mid-17th century (Francis & Morantz, 1983). During
this colonialist period, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) laid claim to the region
under royal charter in 1668 (Francis & Morantz, 1983).
There was little external government influence in James Bay until the 1930s and

1940s (Feit, 1995) when Beaver Preserves were established by the HBC and the
Department of Indian Affairs to combat a severe reduction in beaver populations.3

By the mid-1930s, the provincial government had outlawed all killing of beaver.
The federal government also enacted the Indian Act of 1947. At this point in time,

the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs now required one elected chief and
council for each fur trading post. Chiefs and band councils also were given the
authority by the government to act for the band as a whole (Feit, 1985). Previously,

Cree leadership was more egalitarian, with the tallymen playing a more funda
mental role (Feit, 1985).

In the 1970s, large-scale hydroelectric development by Hydro Québec entered
James Bay (McCutcheon, 1991 ). Prior to this period, the land had remained largely

undeveloped (except for the fur trade and subsistence living) and inaccessible, with

outside access restricted to planes and boat transportation (Salisbury, 1986). From
an economic development perspective, the James Bay Project is one of the largest
hydroelectric projects in the world. James Bay I—the initial stage of the Project—

is capable of producing more than 25,000 megawatts of power; the scope and scale

of such hydroelectric production is tremendous. The first phase of James Bay I
came on-line in 1985. The road infrastructure, built to support the original hydro

electric development, also increased the feasibility of additional natural resource
development. By 1997, forestry and mining activities were becoming aggressively
pursued in the James Bay territory.

James Bay II was, for many years, "on hold" following an intense public rela

tions battle orchestrated by Native groups (Cree and Inuit) and environmental
NGOs (see the documentary Power by Isaacson, 1996). Despite this respite, hydro
electric development is again underway. Feasibility studies for the Eastmain 1-A
and Rupert diversion project are currently in progress (Canadian Environmental

Assessment Agency [CEAA], 2003).
According to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA), Hy
dro Québec 's plan for the diversion project outlines the following elements:
the partial diversion of the Rupert River (maximum of 800 m3/s) into the Eastmain

River; the construction of a power plant (maximum of770 MV) on the Eastmain 1
reservoir; and the addition of structures at the Sarcelle site, at the outlet of Opinaca
reservoir.4

NGOs report that the "partial" diversion of the Rupert will actually reduce the
river's flow by 92%.5 In total, the project will consist of four dams, 51 dikes, two
diversion bays (flooding an area of 395 km2), 12,000 m of diversion channels, and
two permanent access roads. Total costs are estimated at $2 billion Cdn. (U.S.$ 1.49

billion), with the diversion to be completed by 2007 and the Eastmain 1-A power

house online by 2010. In exchange for a revenue-sharing agreement, the Grand

Council of the Cree of Quebec (GCCQ) has agreed not to publicly oppose the
project.
Ted Moses, Grand Chief of the GCCQ and a chief negotiator for the Peace of the

Brave Agreement, explained the Grand Council's rationale for accepting future
economic development in the following way:
What are the real alternatives? Where are we going to get jobs? How are we going
to be able to take care of our children? What is going to happen 25 years from now,

when we have 25,000 people looking for work and a place to live?6

Sociocultural Impact of
Economic Development on the Cree
The fur trade resulted in a number of changes in Cree culture and society.
Francis and Morantz (1983) suggest that "the fur trade in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries probably underscored the development of smaller social

groups and more individualized ownership of resources among the Indians"
(p. 97). Although historically it appears that the Cree spent the winter hunting and
trapping in groups up to 50 people, the fur trade tended to reduce group size "since

they required less food resources in a given area and provided a higher per cap

yield of furs" (p. 97). In addition, the fur trade appears to have more concrete

delineated family hunting territories, although the existence of hunting territori

does not appear to be a fur trade invention (Francis & Morantz, 1983). Althoug

historical accounts of the fur trade often position native peoples as passive victims
the fur trade, in many ways, was a partnership of mutual benefit, with the Cree

playing economic independence and shifting trade advantageously between th

HBC and the French traders (Francis & Morantz, 1983). However, this is n

meant to imply that it was an equal partnership and it remains open to colonial
criticisms.

With the advent of the fur trade, Cree summer settlements became located at th

HBC trading posts. Following nomadic hunting patterns, the Cree traditionally h

lived in large groups only when fishing was plentiful in the summer. Prior to 194

the majority of the Cree lived in the bush and village settlements were not inhabit

year-round except by a small minority (Salisbury, 1986). After 1947, howeve

more and more Cree settled into village life. Nevertheless, by 1971, still more th

half resided primarily in the bush, although many had accommodations in the

lage as a secondary residence. Most tallymen continued to primarily reside in t
bush.

There is some debate over the influence of the fur trade on the Cree system of

land management (see Bishop & Morantz, 1986). The word tallyman is English for
the Cree word amiskuchimaaw, which can be translated as Beaver Boss or steward.
The tallymen's name is related to HBC requirements from the 1930s and 1940s that

a bush leader "tally" (count) beaver houses within his hunting area. During the
1930s, a system of "Beaver Preserves" was institutionalized by Western organiza
tions such as the HBC and the provincial government. Under the Beaver Preserve
system, these tallies were then used to assign annual trapping quotas back to the tal

lyman (who distributed them across his hunting group). The tallyman's job was
also to ensure that the quotas were met but not exceeded.
The Beaver Preserve system appears to have been built on a preexisting indige

nous framework (Feit, 1995). Berkes (1995) demonstrates that the management
practices of the tallyman could not have arisen from a Western worldview. Al
though the English designation may come from the HBC, the form of management

is not a White invention (Berkes, 1995). Hudson's Bay Company Archives (1947)
confirm this:
Our organization [of beaver preserves] is based on Indian tradition and custom, it
meets with approval among the limited number of Indians to whom we have been
able to brings its benefits. The main reason for their appreciation is that once the

White man's practices of written leases and agreements are disposed of we revert

to Indian custom, pattern our organization after their sound, well-established
practice and divide our preserves according to the aboriginal plan of land tenure

that from time immemorial has served the Indian population, (p. 689)

That is, although the Hudson's Bay managers "appointed" a tallyman, this person
was usually a recognized leader in an indigenous system of trapline management.

The appointed person, now formally called a tallyman for Hudson's Bay's pur
poses, was a senior, experienced hunter who was already in charge of his family

hunting ground—a role he continued to enact despite the overlay of the HBC
designation.

Although the development of the fur trade meant that the Cree operated und

dual form of economy (i.e., subsistence and market economies), it did not s

Cree culture away from a reliance on subsistence activities or from their beliefs

practices:
The Indians [Cree] still brought in as many pelts as they wanted, not the number

the company would have liked. European technology continued to be used, but

hunting was still (as it is even today) based on age-old methods The political,
social, and religious life of the James Bay people continued outside the direct
influence of the Europeans, though it was not unaffected by occurrences in the

economic sphere. (Francis & Morantz, 1983, p. 170)
Tanner ( 1979) also confirms that the traditional beliefs tended to guide all activities
that occurred in the bush, including those related to the fur trade. In contrast, the

Christian missionaries who arrived at the trading posts in the 19th-century (Feit,

1995; Francis & Morantz, 1983) actively attempted to change Cree ideology by
positioning Cree beliefs as "witchcraft."
However, the Indian Act institutionally changed Cree leadership structures. The
Indian Act of 1947 was problematic, in part, because "this distribution of authority

did not reflect Cree political culture" (Feit, 1985, p. 35). Historically, a chief was
the leader who oversaw the "summer settlement" but did not oversee the band
throughout the rest of the year. Although the chief was granted certain powers and

responsibilities, it was a role that dispersed with the hunters when they separated

into smaller hunting groups, "micro-bands" (Salisbury, 1986), in the fall. At this

point in time, the hunting group leader (later to be called the tallyman) was in
charge most of the year, with the chief exercising influence over a shorter time
period and only over the summer settlement.7 After the Indian Act, which required

a permanent year-round chief and band council, the leadership structure began to
change, with the chiefs and council receiving more authority.

The leadership role of the chief has changed significantly over time. In the
1980s, Salisbury (1986) notes that Cree chiefs and band managers tended to be
younger, more educated, and English-speaking, in comparison with the more
senior hunting group leaders, who typically spoke only Cree (this has changed over
time with many tallymen now speaking English and Cree). In most cases, the chiefs

were respected community members. They were competent at dealing with exter
nal, "White" institutions and organizations and were valued as community leaders.
Although the tallymen had the opportunity to become more involved in community
affairs through the council, their inability to speak English resulted in little ongoing

involvement (Salisbury, 1986).
With increased pressure from economic development, the role of the chief
intensified. Finally, during the James Bay negotiations, it was the young, English

speaking chiefs (the new administrative elite) who rallied together and suc
cessfully led the fight against unapproved hydroelectric development by Hydro
Québec. Their leadership role at this time continued to reflect the Cree respect for

competence—these leaders were extremely competent at negotiating with the
White world. During this time, these young leaders also sought the advice of older

hunters who were competent in the traditional ways (e.g., the tallymen) (Feit,
1985). For the first time, a Cree regional council was born: the Grand Council of the
Cree.

When the Cree discovered that the James Bay Project was going to be built on
their land, they banded together with the Inuit and launched a large legal and public

relations battle against Hydro-Québec. The Cree and Inuit were partially success
ful in their fight against economic development—in a joint legal action, the native

peoples in the region brought Canada, Québec, and Hydro-Québec to the bargain
ing table. Land claim rights were subsequently recognized in the James Bay and

Northern Québec Agreement (JBNQA, 1976) and a large compensation package
was provided. However, these efforts also were unsuccessful in that development

continued to proceed and became institutionalized in a legal agreement that the
Cree have often viewed as questionable (Grand Council of the Crees, of Québec,
GCCQ, 1995). According to the GCCQ (1995), "It is the firm view of the Crees that

the Agreement was negotiated in 1974-75 under circumstances that were clearly
inequitable, highly pressured and, in a number of key respects, unconscionable"

(p. 252).
Billy Diamond, first Grand Chief who negotiated the agreement, explained the

negotiation process in the following way:
Our feeling was that no one can buy a way of life and culture with money... but we

saw the need to limit the damages, seek remedial works and have certain funda
mental rights recognized. We decided to attempt to negotiate a settlement. We
really had no other choice.... Canada made it clear that if we [the Cree] did not

proceed with the agreement process, unilateral legislation would have been
imposed on us in any case. (Diamond, 1990, cited in GCCQ, 1995, pp. 252- 253)

After the JBNQA was signed, Cree regional organizational structures became
legally institutionalized with the GCCQ, the Cree Regional Authority (CRA), and

the Cree Trappers' Association (CTA), among others. In addition to the Grand
Chief, the Grand Council includes the chief and another leader from each com
munity who sit on the Board of Directors, as well as an executive group made up
of four regional leaders (Feit, 1995). After the settlement, each village became rec

ognized as a municipality (Salisbury, 1986) and became the permanent home to
many of the Cree. The chief and community life became a dominant reality. How

ever, for the people who lived in the bush (in some villages, a sizeable minority),
the traditional system of trapline management (with the tallyman as the leader),
continued.

Environmental impacts of the James Bay Project were significant. All told, at
the end of James Bay I, five hydroelectric reservoirs covered more than 11,000

square kilometers, the seasonal flow pattern of the LaGrande River had been
reversed (and the estuary changed from saltwater to fresh), large dead zones had

been created around each reservoir with a significant loss of wetlands and in
creased soil erosion, animal migration routes had been affected (including the
drowning of 10,000 caribou in September 1994), and a serious increase in methyl
mercury levels in fish and human populations (Berkes, 1990). The mighty rivers of

Eastmain, LaGrande, and the Opinaca were changed drastically. For example, the

Eastmain river was diverted with 90% of its natural flow disappearing (Messier
et al., 1987, cited in Berkes, 1990) into the production of hydroelectricity.

432 ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT / December 2004

Yet Salisbury (1986) argues that the Cree were able to positively control much

of their social evolution following the James Bay Project and the JBNQA. Specifi
cally, he notes improvements in cultural unity, transportation access, communica
tion networks, housing, education, access to the wage economy, and the increased

consumption of goods (e.g., snowmobiles, chainsaws, TVs, radio, clothing, etc.).
With a multi-million-dollar compensation package, the Cree were called (by some)

"the Arabs of the North" (MacGregor, 1989, p. 70).
Another positive outcome of the JBNQA was the implementation of the Income

Security Program (ISP), whereby the provincial Québec government provides
basic income to Cree families following a traditional lifestyle.8 This program has
been quite successful and the Cree Regional Authority suggests that more people

are now pursuing traditional pursuits (hunting, trapping, and fishing), following
the implementation of the ISP (W. Iserhoff, personal communication, 1997). Salis
bury (1986) confirms this: By 1981, the traditional activity of hunting was more
important in Cree villages than a decade earlier, primarily due to the success of the

ISP in making subsistence hunting an economically viable occupation. In addition,
in a detailed evaluation of the ISP, Scott and Feit (1992) conclude that the program
responds well to the needs of Cree harvesters. However, the authors note that the

ISP cannot guarantee the maintenance of hunting life; in addition, the Cree must
maintain their traditional physical relationship with the land.

Nevertheless, Niezen (1993) has highlighted other negative sociocultural im
pacts. Following hydroelectric development, there was a rapid movement toward
permanent village residency. This swift cultural and geographic shift resulted in
high frequencies of suicide, neglect of children, vandalism, and drug and alcohol

abuse (Niezen, 1993). He also suggests that this centralization has "decreased the
proportion of people in the traditional economy—a situation which has led to
social instability in the villages" (p. 510). Infrastructure developments, such as the
road network, also increased the availability of drugs and alcohol. In addition, cen
tralization may have increased the need for a cash economy, as motorized transpor

tation became a necessary part of bush life (see Wenzel, 1991, for a discussion of
the same point with respect to the Inuit).

During the construction of the James Bay Project, two main permanent roads
were built along with numerous temporary (winter) roads (Salisbury, 1986). "By
1981a major road traversed Cree territory, and all settlements were negotiating for
their connection to a road to the outside" (Salisbury, 1986, p. 5). By 1999, all but

two Cree communities had a permanent road (excluding Waskaganish and Whap
magoostui). A main highway connecting Nemaska to Chibougamau—the Route
du Nord—also had been completed in the early 1990s. While undoubtedly bring
ing the Cree numerous benefits (e.g., more convenient and cheaper transporta
tion), the road system also opened the territory up to additional development such

as mining, forestry, and sports hunting and fishing, which brought additional
environmental degradation (e.g., clear-cutting, pollution, illegal hunting, etc.).
McCutcheon ( 1991 ) also notes that the improved road access brought problems for

the tallymen because uncontrolled trapping started to occur in areas adjacent to
roads.

Hydro-Québec researchers present a more positive picture in their summary of
the research on the impact of hydroelectric development 15 years after the project

became operational (Guertin, Demers, & Perusse, 1993). This report, however,
focuses on biophysical research on the environment (predominately with support
ive research results). The authors admit that for "various reasons" (not provided),

the follow-up studies on the sociocultural impacts were not as systematic as f

more biophysical impacts. While acknowledging that the LaGrande comp

affected four out of eight villages, and that some traplines were flooded, they
clude that "the evolution of the number of beneficiaries of the income securit

programme for Cree hunters and trappers in the most affected communities is s

lar to unaffected communities" (p. 405). This implies a marginal sociocultur

impact. They also emphasize the success of the ISP in promoting, in effect pre

ing, "a lifestyle which seemed condemned" (p. 406) and highlight the region

Cree infrastructure as a positive outcome of both the Agreement and hydroelectr

development.
Furthermore, these authors focus exclusively on the positive benefits of the road

network for the Cree, that is, the decrease in the prices of products; increased eco

nomic and cultural exchanges with other Cree communities and the south; easier
hunting, fishing, and trapping; and improved, more convenient access to remote
traplines. Negative impacts, such as uncontrolled access (a precursor to the "trag
edy of the commons," see Hardin, 1968), are not identified. Even the increase in
recreational hunting and fishing by non-Natives is also viewed as a positive change

that creates only limited and localized competition with Cree pursuits.

The only negative sociocultural effect identified in this corporate study is a
decrease in employment in the 1980s (and its related social problems) following
"diminished growth in the tertiary sector and construction activities resulting from

the implementation of the agreement" (p. 406). Not surprisingly, the solution
offered by the Hydro-Québec researchers is that "new avenues of development

must be opened up" (pp. 406-407). Thus, the implicit message is that the
sociocultural effects of development have been positive; the only negative effects

(i.e., unemployment) result when development activities are diminished. The pos
sible impacts on Cree tallymen are never researched and therefore mitigation plans

are not identified or addressed. The authors conclude that the James Bay Project is

a project "in accord with its environment" (p. 387).

In another impact assessment, the same imbalance appears. In "The
Chibougamau-Nemiscau Road: Environmental and Social Impact Assessment
Summary" (Cree Construction & Ministere des Transports, Gouvernement du
Québec, 1990), there is again no recognition of the negative sociocultural impacts

(particularly on the role of the tallyman) of the proposed permanent highway.
Whereas "active native campsites" are identified as features of "very high resis
tance" to the road, there is no discussion of how the tallymen and other trappers
(who live on and use these campsites) will be affected by a permanent road. Conse
quently, there is no need for mitigating action.

In summary, previous research on the sociocultural impacts of development
tends to treat the Cree as one large homogeneous group and does not adequately

investigate impacts on Cree tallymen despite their cultural significance and sus
tainable approach to management.
RESEARCH METHOD

When I first arrived in James Bay, I originally began to study the impac

hydroelectric development on the Cree people. More specifically, I hoped to

ine the human experience of living next to one of the world's largest hydroelec

dams, the James Bay Project. This was my "foreshadowed" research questi

(Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995). After my fieldwork began, I realized that d

sions about development inevitably broadened. By 1995, economic development
of the region had expanded into mining, forestry, tourism, as well as hydro-power.

These activities seemed to have cumulative and interrelated effects on both the
Cree culture and the natural environment, at least from the perspective of the Cree.

Anthropological research confirmed that Cree elders viewed the James Bay
Project as just one example of an ongoing relationship with "White men" (Feit,
1985). In addition, discussions about the impact of development tended to be
framed against the "way it used to be," that is, the way the land was traditionally

managed. In time, it dawned on me that I had no real conceptualization of this tra

ditional management approach and that perhaps this was a critical research ques
tion in itself. Eventually, I refocused my Ph.D. dissertation on a description of the

traditional ecologically embedded management practices of the Cree tallymen
(Whiteman, 1999; Whiteman & Cooper, 2000).
However, the impacts of development remained an important research issue
during my fieldwork. This article presents my ethnographic findings on this topic,

specifically from the perspective of Cree tallymen.9 It is based on 18 months of

ethnographic fieldwork over a 2-year period, including a 10-week apprentice
ship to a well-respected tallyman, Freddy Jolly, who acted as my key informant in

this study. Data were collected through participant observation and in-depth
ethnographic interviews (Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995).
In addition to participant observation, I undertook a series of in-depth inter
views (Fontana & Frey, 1994) with Cree trappers, elders, tallymen, and key mem
bers of the local band councils, the CTA, and the Cree Regional Authority. In total,

I conducted 31 interviews. Most interviews were in English but some were in Cree,
with translation provided by my key informant. My key informant, Freddy Jolly,

requested that his real name be used, as has occurred in other anthropological work

with the Cree (e.g., Preston, 1982). Others are quoted anonymously. This article
also relies on document analysis of Web sites and key documents such as the James

Bay and Northern Québec Agreement (JBNQA), among others.
Data analysis was iterative. Rough, broad categorization occurred during my
fieldwork and was refined by further data collection. Emergent themes and dimen

sions were identified through the continual review of notes, interview data, field

journal entries, and comparison with other research. Detailed coding work was
done outside the field site with the qualitative data analysis software program QSR

NU*DIST (Nonnumerical Unstructured Data Indexing Searching and Theoriz
ing). Specifically, all interview data were transcribed and coded using NU*DIST.
Handwritten field notes were not transcribed but were coded by hand with the same

coding system. Data analysis also relied on ongoing respondent validation by a
variety of Cree participants, including Freddy Jolly (Hammersley & Atkinson,

1995).
RESEARCH FINDINGS

Tallymen Talking: "On The Impact of Development"

My field research suggests that cumulative economic development throug

the past 30 years has a direct and far-reaching impact on Cree tallymen. Find

suggest that economic development in the region has resulted in tallymen l

control over resources and management decisions. Furthermore, forestry, mi

and hydroelectric development have resulted in a significant loss of natur

sources and environmental degradation and have negatively affected the tally
men's ability to manage. This appeared to have resulted in a gradual lessening of

respect for this traditional role among community members. These impacts, in
turn, had a strong emotional impact on individual tallymen and to some degree
have caused a schism within Cree culture.
Before presenting emergent themes from my data, I first present an extended

excerpt of an interview I conducted with a well-respected Cree elder and tally
man, who offers an emotional and representative perspective on the impact of
development.
A Tallyman Talks
I'm going to tell about what they're doing to my land now. How the Whiteman
enters our land. Before, in the olden days, there was no Whiteman. It was like the

stories I've told you about. Now ... if you look at my land, our trapline is a huge
size. There were a lot of trees during the time of my story. All kinds of trees, dif

ferent kinds of trees, huge tall trees. Now if you look at my land, it's all flat—
clear-cutting. Even the mountains.
Before they cut the trees we had a meeting with the forestry company and told

them about places not to cut—the moose yards. There's one place that moose used
to hang around, where we used to get our food. That's the main part. That's the part

we didn't want to be clear-cut. They didn't even listen to us. They cut all the trees
and took them. All over the place. There was a favourite spot for hunting and there

were huge mountains but now they're gone. It's all clear-cut. There's only one
small part and that's the only place we can go for moose hunting, that's the last
part where it's not clear-cut.

The other places that are clear-cut we cannot get anything, not even a moose.
Where they were clear-cutting and destroying the ground, taking even what the
beaver eats [the branches]. The mess they make, they pollute the water, the lakes.

It affects the beaver. The lakes are dirty. The damage they do, and the roads, it

affects the animals. Even fish. There's a spot where we used to go fishing. It's
really different now. When the lakes are polluted, it goes through the rivers and
streams. The fish are different. It affects them through the water, everything goes

into the lakes. The beaver too. The beaver moves away, moves out to where it's not
affected.

I'm the tallyman of my trapline. They don't listen to me even though I tell
them What does Wahmschtickoosh [the White man] mean when he says that
[the earth is not alive]? The earth is living. And still today, God is giving us life to
live.

There's one more thing that I want to say to her [the researcher]. Not to believe

in what they [the Whitemen] teach you. Believe in what I believe. (Cree elder and

tallyman, personal communication, March 29, 1997, Mistassini, James Bay)

Although each tallyman's story remains unique, there were a number of com
mon themes that emerged from my research. These are presented in more detail

below, followed by a discussion.
Loss of Control
The tallymen interviewed felt that a key impact of economic development has

been a shift in traditional power and a loss of control over natural resource use.
Document analysis and interviews suggest that as a result of the JBNQA, the tally

man's management and leadership function is shared with, and often eclipsed by,

the Cree regional and community leaders as well as with government and corp
decision makers.

Under the JBNQA, the provincial government of Québec has the right to

eral and forestry development in Category 2 and Category 3 land (the Cree re

full rights to Category 1 land, which is the site of the villages and band cou
Yet, the majority of Cree traplines are located in Category 2 and 3 designated

and each of these is managed by a tallyman. Although the JBNQA may hav

brought about greater regional unity, tallymen felt that it also brought a disrup

and splintering of local control over local resources. Previously, tallymen had
cultural right to make decisions about natural resource management on their

traplines. The JBNQA legally shifted authority from the tallymen toward the c

and Grand Chief, and formal negotiations for natural resource developmen

required consultation with the Grand Council of the Crees and local chiefs bu

not require local negotiations with specific tallymen even when their trapl
would bear the brunt of the impacts.

A tallyman summarized this position as follows:
Both in the Cree society and in non-Native society, I would say that. Yes. In the
past, you know when a tallyman had... he had a piece of land and the tallyman had

the sole responsibility. He had authority over that land. He was able to determine

which people can go there and which places they can go. He can put also, you
know, a limit of what game can be killed. And today, that's almost impossible
because so much development has been focused on the north. You know? No mat
ter what the tallyman tries to do, somehow nobody seems to listen to them and
they just go ahead anyway.

Freddy Jolly, my key informant, stated similar concerns publicly in a letter to

Cree magazine The Nation (1997):
There has been a lot of destruction on our lands. Forestry, mining, roads, the hydro

projects and more, these have all changed our lands and our way of life. As a Cree,
I have cried when they destroyed our lands. As a tallyman, I have tried in so many
ways to stop this but nothing has worked. The development and abuse of our lands

continues, and the tallyman no longer has the power to save his trapline.

Interview data indicated that this concern was widespread among tallymen.

The road infrastructure, built to support economic development, had als

sulted in a loss of control. A past chief of Mistassini provided the following gene

perspective:
Even though the tallyman are there, they give orders, they try the best way they
can, whatever authority was handed down to them to look after that land, they're

trying their best to control it. But because of access roads, and you know, ski

doos—now you can have skidoos leave here and head down at 200 miles [per
hour] and no problem, they can... they're so economical. And you know, they're
all over the place. Nobody car: control them anymore.

Interviews with tallymen along the Route du Nord confirmed that the road (w

convenient) had opened their traplines to outsiders. Although an environmen

and social impact assessment of the Route du Nord was undertaken, docume

Whiteman/CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 437

analysis indicated that it did not identify any possible cultural impacts on the tally

men. Yet my field research indicates that the road infrastructure had directly

affected the tallymen. A tallyman explained his concern, "These days, you've got

access mainly by roads, helicopters, planes, you name it. How is a tallyman able to
control all this?"
On the positive side, in an interview with a member of the CTA, the suggestion

was made that the introduction of the ISP allowed tallymen to maintain some

economic clout because tallymen have control over who lives on the trapline, and
therefore, the tallymen indirectly have control over who receives Income Security.
But tallymen who were interviewed in my study did not raise this as a key benefit.

Loss of Resources
Participant observation and interview data indicated that the loss of natural
resources was a community-wide problem for the Cree Nation. As one tallyman

explained,
They [the development companies] don 't even think about Eenou, how they live in
the bush. They destroy all the things that Eenou has. How will they survive in the

bush when they destroy the land, the animals? They're destroying our money in
our Cree bank in the bush.

Other tallymen agreed that development has brought change to the environment:
Before. Well before for sure it was different from today, that's for sure. Wherever

we went before we were able to notice game quite regularly, wherever we went. At

that time there was no disturbance. Because we were able to leave our hunting ter
ritory in the spring time when we finished hunting and while we were away there

was no disturbance in the territory and when we come back in the fall there's...
because there was no disturbance of any sort, animals roamed around freely and

came near the territories where we were hunting before. That's not possible or
hardly possible nowadays because there's the access road here through the trans
mission line, there's Route du Nord, there's transmission lines ... practically all
the transmission lines except for one right at the end which misses my trapline.
Today, the biggest problems are forestry and mining. The mining I say will be a

big problem because I can see the damage it causes. They won't be able to eat the
fish because of the pollution it's going to face.
Before there were any roads, it was different. It was good hunting. Even there
were lots of birds, geese, ducks, partridge. In some of the areas of the river where
there is shallow water, you would see a lot of ducks in the water before there were
any roads— Just walking along the shores of the river, I killed 46 geese one time.
Where the good spots were, where we used to stay, now they're not there. The spot
is not very far from the road. It's the road that affects this. It erases off everything.

Where the road is, everything has been erased.

Interview data indicated that tallymen were seriously worried about environmental

impacts of roads clear-cutting, mining, and the impact of illegal hunting and fish
ing. Tallymen whose trapline had been affected by hydroelectric development also

were concerned about these environmental impacts. Tallymen also noted that
sports hunting (particularly illegal) brought additional pressure on the natural

environment.

438 ORGANIZATION & ENVIRONMENT / December 2004

Loss of a Management Approach?

When natural resources were changed significantly through economic de
opment, tallymen felt that their ability to practice traditional management

directly affected—their place of work was destroyed or harmed, as was their ab

to teach younger generations. In the face of environmental degradation from

nomic development, Freddy lamented, "They're destroying our classroom!"

similarly, in the wake of a proposed hydro-expansion, Freddy said, "[My trap

will be flooded. All my tools will be under the water." Tools, in this case, bei

housed in the land itself. In many cases, tallymen felt that financial compe

tion could not simply mitigate such impacts. "No wonder we want to keep our

and love our land," an important Cree elder and tallyman said, "That's how
survive—from the land."

Economic development and the JBNQA also appeared to have affected the
tallymen's "walking outside" approach to management, which my earlier research
has found to be key to their sustainable management approach. According to a past

chief and tallyman,
Before the signing [of the JBNQA], the trappers, the hunters that harvested out
there on the land, stayed out there on the land. They walked. They canoed. They
did everything with their own physical bodies. And since the signing of the Agree

ment, there's all kinds of subsidies that came out, financial subsidies for gas and
ground transportation, air transportation. And since then, a lot of the trappers and
the hunters that used to go out there started to, you know, be overweight. We have

problems with diabetes.

While Freddy powerfully talked about how his management knowledge came
from "walking," he recognized that he no longer practiced this as fully as he had in
the past. At the same time, Freddy felt that the TEK from the elders was so powerful

because it stemmed directly from this approach: "So whatever the elders say, it

comes true. Because like I said, they have seen this. They have walked on this
land—it's called James Bay territory."

Nevertheless, participant observation and interviews indicated that tallymen
still spent a great amount of time out on the land "touring" and extensively travers

ing their local ecosystem, more so than most other Cree community and band
council members.
Like me, as a tallyman I travel. I travel all over my trapline in winter and in the
summer and in the fall and in the spring. Cause I know. I see. I have five senses. My

trapline is like an office to me... we never get books, reading the books about ani

mals, all we see is in our land. The tracks of the animals, that's our book.

Loss of Respect
The loss of natural resources, combined with a significantly reduced control
over the remaining resources, appears to have led to a loss of cultural respect for the

tallyman. The following quote presents this impact and it was confirmed by many
others:
Even with our own people, it's the same thing. Today, I see ... it's just a title. It's
just a title. It doesn't have the authority or the respect it had at one time. Although
I'm hoping that by talking about it, and by bringing it to the attention of a lot of

people, which I do a lot of the time, that eventually there will be a recognition
again at a very high level that yes, if anything needs to be done to that land it has to

go through the tallyman. Because it's the tallyman that looks after that land.

Loss of cultural respect in turn further impedes the tallyman's ability to control

access to resources. A past chief discussed the relationship between control,
respect, and economic development:
I'm going to... point my finger at the signing of the James Bay and Northern Qué

bec Agreement. Because ever since then... before signing the Agreement, the tal

lymen were, had a... they had authority. They... they knew how to traverse the
land. They knew all of... the whole territory. And they knew just exactly how
many people they can allow to come in and hunt on their territory without damag
ing or impacting whatever animals that were in that territory. So, they had control,
complete control over that territory in terms of harvesting, nurturing, and looking

after the land basically and promoting respect for that land. And then the Agree

ment was signed and you know people had money... And basically, the authority
of the tallyman started dwindling to the extent that... I think that it would be fair
to say that we're starting to lose respect for the tallyman... within the Cree culture
as well. It's not a fair statement to make but it's a fact.

Emotional and Spiritual Loss
Although the loss of resources affects all Cree, my data suggest that the impact
was magnified for the tallymen who saw themselves as the traditional caretakers of

the land. Without an exception, the Cree tallymen in my study voiced a strong per

sonal identification with their land. Freddy summarized this perspective, "When
you live in the bush all year long, watching over it, the land speaks to you. So when

the tallymen speak, it is the land speaking."

Tallymen perceived the local ecology as a place of work and a place of rest:
"There's healing in the mind in the bush." Environmental degradation thus affected

both their work and their sanctuary. A loss or degradation of resources was per
ceived to be a highly emotional and traumatic event. For example, a tallyman from

Nemaska explained, "[Development] weakened the trapper. He doesn't have the
full strength to go on.... It's like you wounded the man when he sees his land, all
chopped. It's like the tallyman doesn't have any rights." Similar to many tallymen,
Freddy argued that if economic development continued, "There will be a lot of

wounded hunters looking back at where they used to live, what they used to do—
hunt, fish, trap."

According to one tallyman, there was an urgent need to
bring out something to awaken the chiefs to what the tallyman is facing in the
bush. The hurts. I'm sure the tallymen are hurt a lot but they [the chiefs] don't
seem to understand the hurt they're facing because their heart isn't in the bush.

There's a trapper that told me that he has got nothing and they're chopping the
trees in his trapline. The chief said he was negotiating but he hasn't got anything.

It's just words. You have to act upon your faith.

A WOUNDED HUNTER

All his senses will be wounded,
he'll be a wounded hunter.
He'll be looking back to his land where he was born and

raised,
the hills and mountains will be turned into islands.
He will look back to the rivers and lakes where he used to set
his traps and fish nets,
as a wounded hunter.

A wounded hunter will have no more the sound of rapids or
the sound of the ice breaking as it floats down the river.

He'll now look back to his land where he had a good time
hunting and fishing, as a wounded hunter.

Looking back to his land where his joy was.
Looking back to his land where he used to walk.
Looking back, watching his family laughing while roasting
beaver.

A wounded hunter will only have the tears of his past,
a wounded hunter's mind will be different,

he'll be wandering around to a strange land,
a land that is flooded.
A hunter who has been wounded will be wounded the rest
of his life,

until he passes away.
—Freddy Jolly, Cree Tallyman (1992; first appeared in the
Grand Council/Cree Regional Authority report on the

environmental, economic, and social impacts of James Bay II)

A Schism Within Cree Culture

My data suggested that the ongoing economic development has created internal
division within Cree culture. Document analysis of the JBNQA indicated that the
importance of the "formalized" chiefs (and Grand Chief) as negotiators has shifted

spheres of responsibility and significantly affected the traditional leadership con
trol of the tallymen over natural resources. This was a source of great debate within

the Cree Nation during my fieldwork. This shift in decision-making authority
caused difficulties. As a past Grand Youth Chief explained,
Before there was a fight between the Cree and the government. Now there's a fight

between the Cree, the government, and the Cree amongst themselves. So the peo

ple who will win—I don't know who but somebody's going to win. And I feel it
will be the people who want to bring back the role of the tallyman, have ît recog

nized and bring back the laws of the trapline.

A number of tallymen elaborated extensively on this. For instance, according to
Freddy Jolly,
It's different [now]. Like in the olden days, they [the chiefs and tallymen] re
spected each other. They listened to each other. The tallyman. But now, since they

signed the Agreement, there's only the Chiefs. The Chiefs want to control the
land. The Cree land. But like I said, there's 291 traplines, 325 tallymen. When
they signed the [JBNQA] Agreement, they forgot about the tallyman. 'Cause us,

as a tallyman, we watch over our land, like trapline R-21, on my side. So, that's
how the tallyman is. We watch over. Even when the government comes and have

contracts over here or flooding or building the roads or... clear-cutting— When

the government wants to do something, it goes to the Grand Council of the Crees,
like Board of Directors, the chiefs, all the chiefs in nine communities, and even the
counselors, but they forgot about the tallyman. But now, like what they're doing,
it's us, the tallyman, the trappers in our trapline, we're the ones that are affected.

We're the ones who's suppose to decide whatever the government wants to do up
here, up north, 'cause we know our traplines. We walk on our traplines all winter.
We hunt. We fish. We trap. So, it's very hard for them to decide 'cause they only sit
in the office.

That's why I say, whenever they want to do something up north, first they
should talk to the tallymen and their families. They are the ones... they should go
to first before any chiefs decide or counselors decide or even people in Category 1.

'Cause we are in Category 3. When they signed the Agreement, they call it Cate
gory 3 but for me and my family we call it Category 1. That's the Cree land, James
Bay territory. Cause when they signed the Agreement, like I said, they make their

decisions right inside Category 1 [in the village and band council]. But I want it
differently. I want the tallymen to be there. All the tallymen to be there whenever
the contracts, or whenever something's going to come up, or a mine. It's us, the tal

lymen and the trappers, the full-time trappers, it's us—we have to decide if we
want this mine or forestry or road to be built, or NBR, or whatever Hydro-Québec
wants to do up north. It's us, the trappers, the tallymen who should sit on meetings

and talk about this. And that would be equal. And that would be collective, collec

tive voices. But... when they signed the Agreement, and the chiefs want to con
trol the land, they don't see all the Land. They only see in the office and papers.
But us, the tallymen and the trappers, we know. We know our lands. On our lands,
on the ground, that's where we get our food. Under the water, that's where we get
our food.

Other tallymen also discussed this issue in detail. According to one tallyman,
I've always wondered to what extent do the chief and council have authority over
the land, when they talk about the land? Because if you look at the political level,
they look at the categories of land. You know, Category 1 lands under federal juris

diction and most of their funding for government services come from that. But

does it expand beyond that? You know? If there's development in my territory
does the chief have the right to say, "Yes, they can go ahead with that." Or... does

the tallyman? And I question that. And they say, "Well..." They always come
back to the "collective rights." Will this affect the rights of all the Crees in the

James Bay area. No tallyman can go and make a decision or make an agreement
with a company, you know, a development company unless if it's a consensus
reached by all the Cree communities I was there in a meeting where there were
a lot of other tallymen from other Cree communities and they were talking about

the building of the road, the Route du Nord. And I guess the Grand Chief was
there, the Chief, his Chief was there also, and they were all being pressured to
come up with a decision on the road. Of course [the tallyman] was opposing it.
And then of course, the last person ... you know, said, "So, should we go ahead
with this project? All in favour raise your hand."
That's the wrong system that's used in a lot of decision making within the

communities, that's a show of hands. [The tallyman] was saying, "You know, I
watched around and I see one guy look around and put his hand up. And the other
people started looking around and put their hand up." And he asked them, "You're

from Waswanipi. You have a trapline over there. Does it affect you, this road?
What gives you the right to decide what's happening on my territory?" And that
really hit me when he said that, and that's what's been happening a lot. Sometimes

it's the chiefs and the counselors of these communities that pressure other people
within the community to make a decision on somebody else's trapline or territory.

And that's why I was saying we have to get approval from the tallyman. They
know what their responsibilities are. They're not there to just go after money.
Unless they'd be rich by now!

Data indicated that the CTA did attempt to incorporate the tallymen's perspec

through a series of General Assembly meetings where the tallymen can give v

to concerns about trapline management. In addition, the local CTA committ
worked with the community band council and tallymen were able to approach

committee with concerns. However, this type of input was not perceived by

tallymen to be the same as their past decision-making authority and this was see

problematic.
According to a past chief,
Right now there is an organization in place, The Cree Trappers' Association. But,
basically, as far as I know, and a number of people I've talked to, they only look
after the interests of the trappers, the hunter. You know? And they don't single out
the tallyman and put him up here. And that's what they need to do. And if the Cree

Trappers' Association won't do that, then the tallymen themselves have to orga
nize themselves and do that. Because it's difficult right now I mean, I represent
[one of the villages] at the regional government but I don't know if individual tal

lymen accept me to speak on his behalf about what happens in his territory....
[The tallymen's] understanding is that "we're the tallymen and whatever happens

in our territory, our trapline, we should have a say in it. And the council, they
should just stay back and run the community."... Then again, the regional govern

ment, the Grand Council of the Crees, have a mandate to protect the rights and
interests of the territory, so they come in and say, "Listen, you want to talk, discuss

development, you talk to us." So there's nothing in place that really clearly defines

who talks, who has authority over development.

In some cases, my fieldwork indicated that local band officials tried to act as a
bridge between development companies and tallymen. But this was not always
successful because the companies often did not act on the advice of the tallymen,
even when consulted. One tallyman explained,
One time a chief came to me and they were telling me to show [the forestry com

pany] the good spots where you have big trees. Then they gave me a map and I
drew circles where the big trees were. Then they asked me again, where are the
moose yards? Also, where do they go for the mating season? There's only two
things that they asked me about: the trees and the moose. Then they told me the

meeting is finished, and they went. But after, the moose hunters came in. And
then, the forestry company came in and cut down the trees.

In such cases, the local band ran the risk of appearing to represent the interests of

company officials rather than the tallymen. In part, this is because companies are
under no legal obligation to incorporate the tallyman's advice despite band efforts
to gain tallyman input.

Summary
James Bay remains the site of old wounds and much environmental, cultural,
and legal controversy. The results of my research indicate that the economic devel

opment throughout the past 30 years has seriously affected the Cree tallymen.
These findings provide important and new baseline information on impacts from

past development. Perhaps most pressing is the tallymen's loss of control over re
sources, loss of respect as a manager, and conflict within Cree communities. Eco

nomic development and cultural power shifts in Cree society as a result of the
JBNQA have resulted in a significant loss of control and a decline in the tallyman's

traditional managerial role. Tallymen also experienced strong feelings of emo
tional and spiritual loss as a result. Finally, these impacts on the Cree Tallymen also

have resulted in division and conflict within the Cree culture. Notably, a schism
between the tallymen as grassroots local managers and the regional authority of the
chiefs and Grand Chiefs and council was identified.

DISCUSSION/IMPLICATIONS

There are two key implications that arise from this research. First, this rese

has urgent and practical implications for the environmental impact assessmen

Hydro-Québec's proposed hydroelectric expansion, the Eastmain 1-A and R

diversion project. Second, there are broader implications for the study of ec

cally embedded managers such as Cree tallymen.

For the Proposed Expansion Project

Although ignored in most of the research on impacts of economic developm

the Cree tallymen are an important cultural and managerial group to consid

economic development plans continue. Such impacts should not be ignored
cause Cree tallymen have traditional cultural importance for the Cree and

have importance at large to the field of sustainable management (see Whitem

Cooper, 2000).

Last August, the Canadian Environmental Protection Agency (CEAA, 200

released directives to guide the preparation of the impact statement for the

main 1-A and Rupert diversion project. These were approved by the Ministe

Environment and submitted to the Société de'energie de la Baie-James (SEB

subsidiary of Hydro- Québec. A review of these directives indicates that the Cre

general must be consulted on the EIA and that the traditional knowledge of
Cree also must be incorporated into baseline information for the assessment

also to help identify key issues. However, there is currently no explicit provisio

the directives to consult with the tallymen as a group on the proposed project

there is danger that their views may become subsumed under the Cree in gener

On the positive side, project impacts are supposed to be identified as a w

and also "according to each family hunting ground" (p. 9). The EIA directiv

require the proponent to describe the environment in terms of "the land regim

effect and the delimitation of Cree hunting grounds and a description of th

and management of their hunting grounds (current system of Cree hunting

ers)" (p. 23). A description of the social environment, including the transform

throughout the past 30 years, is also required and "this portrait must include

point of views of the Crees, the elderly, adults, youth and women on the dev

ment and on the health, the social and economic benefits and impacts of dev

ment" (p.38). Hydro-Québec "must also describe the changes that have occurr

over the last 30 years, to the traditional use of the hunting grounds" (p. 42).

Consequently, the findings from my study have direct applicability and v

for this aspect of the EIA because it provides important baseline information on

Cree tallymen. These findings are particularly relevant given there is very littl

vious research on the impact of development on the tallymen who are the leaders of

the family hunting grounds (traplines).

After describing the baseline information, the EIA must then describe the im
pacts of the proposed expansion project (including the proposed new roads) on the

Cree land tenure system as well as on their social, economic, and cultural environ
ment. In addition, the Proponent must "identify and evaluate the Project's cumula
tive environmental and social impacts combined with the effects of other existing
works or activities, that have been carried out over the last 30 years, or that are rea

sonably foreseeable over the next decade" (p. 48). Although my findings suggest
that tallymen were still able to actively pursue their traditional management ap

proach, additional economic development and cumulative impacts may seriously
compromise their ability to maintain this role in the future. Certainly, my findings

suggest that the proposed expansion project should anticipate that there may be
additional impacts for the tallymen in terms of a further loss of control, additional
loss of resources (particularly for those traplines most affected), greater loss of cul

tural importance and respect, as well as individual impacts such as emotional and
spiritual losses for Cree tallymen. These impacts may significantly compromise
tallymen's ability to enact their sustainable management role at the local level, un
less properly mitigated.
The EIA directives are important and clearly set the foundation for including an
analysis of the direct and indirect impacts on the Cree tallymen from the proposed

expansion. However, Hydro-Québec's previous research (e.g., Guertin et al.,
1993) has consistently ignored Cree tallymen as an important and distinct group
and instead focused on positive benefits for the Cree as a whole. Yet my findings

strongly indicate that past development has seriously affected the tallymen and
suggest that future development will likely add to these unless proper mitigation
plans are enacted. Without effective mitigation measures, a further loss of control,

resources, and cultural respect will likely cause undue emotional and spiritual
problems for individual tallymen and could irreversibly compromise their ability
to enact in sustainable grassroots local management. These potential impacts must

be effectively identified and addressed in the EIA for a fair and equitable assess
ment of the project to be made.

The Loss of an

Ecologically Embedded Management Model
The value of the Cree tallymen goes far beyond the individual trapline. Their

ecologically embedded approach to management is valuable to other business
managers who are struggling to find their own sustainable pathways. Just as arche

ological sites have cultural value beyond their specific location, so too do the
tallymen.
At a basic level, economic development activities such as mining, forestry, and
hydro and sports hunting impact the natural capital of the trapline. In addition, my

research findings indicate that economic development has resulted in significant
social impacts on the tallymen, particularly with respect to a loss of control over
resources and the loss of cultural respect for their ecologically embedded man

agement role. Such social impacts are likely to have additional environmental
repercussions because the tallymen operate as grassroots environmental stewards

(Whiteman & Cooper, 2000).

Whiteman/CREE TALLYMEN SPEAK OUT 445

In the past, they have accomplished this job successfully (e.g., see Berkes, 1995,

1999). But without the tallyman's organized system of trapline management, the
ecological sustainability of the James Bay region may be questionable. Currently,

tallymen no longer have the authority to determine what happens on their lands—

in many cases, the chiefs and Grand Council now make economic development
decisions that would historically have been under the tallyman's geographic sphere

of control. Without control, sustainable resource management becomes difficult. If

tallymen cannot control access to resources or decisions on natural resource devel
opment, how can they continue to act as environmental stewards?
The situation is complicated by the confusion about who has the right to negoti

ate with development companies—the tallyman, the chiefs, the Grand Council of

the Crees, or some combination? The new Agreement for the expansion project
(and other future economic development), called "Peace of the Brave," does not
resolve this issue. Although the Peace of the Brave recognizes Cree ownership of
natural resources, it does not recognize the tallymen's traditional decision-making

powers, which are superseded by the Grand Council, local chiefs, and the Cree
community at large (across all nine villages). This problem is exacerbated by the
increasingly open access to the traplines provided by the expanded road infrastruc
ture to be used to support hydroelectric expansion. This may result in a further shift

toward "open access," resulting in yet another case of the "tragedy of the com
mons" (Hardin, 1968).
The proposed Eastmain 1-A and Rupert diversion project will directly affect a
number of traplines, and thus directly affect the management practices of the tally

men in charge of these ecologies. This includes trapline R-21, where Freddy Jolly,

my key informant, resides and where I extensively studied the tallyman's ecologi

cally embedded approach to management. This project will seriously affect
Freddy's trapline: If the EIA is approved, the north section of trapline R-21 will be
under the water, flooded by part of the diversion bay. The classroom will be filled,

but not with students. The Rupert River, which runs through the rest of the trapline,

will be reduced to a small flow. The loss is not simply academic. Real-world sus
tainable managers, such as Freddy, are not common. Their practical models of sus

tainable management are extremely useful for learning about social-ecosystem
resilience and the role of the sustainable manager (see Whiteman & Cooper, 2000).

Until a comprehensive EIA (one that includes impacts specifically on or for
tallymen) is undertaken, the extent of the impacts on the management practices of

the tallymen is unclear. However, what is clear is that past impacts have already
compromised the tallymen's ability to enact their ecologically embedded approach
to management. Although historical development, such as the fur trade, had many

impacts on the Cree, the tallymen's ecologically embedded approach was able
to survive, partly because it built on this preexisting Indigenous approach to land
management.

Yet economic development throughout the past 30 years has ignored this pre
existing approach and legally shifted authority away from the tallymen toward less

ecologically embedded decision makers. The costs of this for the Cree, for the
sustainability of James Bay, and for the world at large are not known. Yet, as the

tallymen's approach is lost, so too is the managerial wisdom and practices of this
local sustainable manager. The concrete examples of Cree tallymen provide impor
tant beacons for practical guidance on sustainable management and must be pro
tected because there are so few other examples.

CONCLUSION

When the late Québec Premier Robert Bourassa unveiled his master plan fo

screen (Busby, 1991, p. 8). In his dramatic introduction, Bourassa (like many

nizational and political leaders) demonstrated his ignorance of (and disregar

the préexistence of a natural world—the invisible "other" that came into being

when its landscape became ripe for economic development. And predic

enough, for the inhabitants of this "other" world (plants, wildlife, tallyme

other kind of world did begin that day—and the environmental effects of it

immediate and monumental. The social and cultural impacts have taken more

to be recognized, particularly for the Cree tallymen. My study attempts to fill
gap by providing ethnographic research on the impact of past development on

tallymen from the perspectives of the tallymen themselves.

This research is important because tallymen continue to have important cult

significance to the Cree and also broader significance to the field of sustain
management (Whiteman & Cooper, 2000). Furthermore, findings from this

provide valuable and essential baseline information for the EIA of the pro

Eastmain 1 -A and Rupert diversion project. The ongoing survival of the tally

ecologically embedded management approach has value to the Cree and to

world at large—and a comprehensive approach to EIA must recognize that f

3. The origins of this ecological collapse are not fully clear, although they can be att

uted in part to the influence and aggressive activities of White trappers in the area (F

1995). However, Cree trapping activities were also a factor, which points to the fallibilit

Cree methods. Yet the Cree were in support of the conservation strategy and some commun

ties had already reached a consensus decision to stop trapping prior to the government

actions (Feit, 1995). Furthermore, there is historical evidence that the Cree practiced bea

conservation in the mid-1800s (Francis & Morantz, 1983). One historical strategy utilize
by the Cree was to leave a portion of their lands untrapped. This strategy continues today
