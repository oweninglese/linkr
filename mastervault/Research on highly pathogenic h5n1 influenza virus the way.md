## Research on Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Influenza Virus: The Way

## Forward

**ABSTRACT
The voluntary #moratorium on #gain-of-function research related to the #transmissibility of highly [[pathogenic]] [[H5N1]]
[[influenza]] [[virus]] should continue, pending the resolution of critical policy questions concerning the rationale for performing such
experiments and how best to report their results. The potential #benefits and risks of these experiments must be discussed and
understood by multiple stakeholders, including the general #public, and all decisions regarding such research must be made in a
#transparent manner.**

### The influenza virus research community is to be 
commended for implementing a voluntary moratorium on “[[gain-of-
function]]” experiments related to the #transmissibility of highly
#pathogenic #H5N1 #influenza #virus (1). As a key funder of #influenza
virus #research, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, a component of the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]],
strongly supports the continuation of this #moratorium pending
the resolution of critical #policy #issues related to the rationale for
performing and reporting such experiments. We need to be cer-
tain that the fundamental purposes of this work, together with its
risks and benefits, are understood by multiple #stakeholders, in-
cluding the general #public, and that decisions are made in a trans-
parent manner.
It is clear that the scientists who conducted the experiments
that triggered this debate (2, 3), and who are among those who
voluntarily signed onto the moratorium, have conducted their
research properly and under the safest and most secure condi-
tions. However, the issue that has been intensely debated is
whether knowledge obtained from these experiments could inad-
vertently affect public health in an adverse way, even in nations
multiple [[time zones]] away. Putting aside the specter of bioterror-
ism for the moment, consider this hypothetical scenario: an im-
portant #gain-of-function experiment involving a virus with seri-
ous pandemic potential is performed in a well-regulated, world-
class laboratory by experienced investigators, but the information
from the experiment is then used by another scientist who does
not have the same training and facilities and is not subject to the
same regulations. In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events,
what if that #scientist becomes #infected with the #virus, which leads
to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic? Many ask rea-
sonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario—how-
ever #remote—should the initial #experiments have been performed
and/or published in the first place, and what were the processes
involved in this decision?
### Scientists working in this field might say—as indeed I have said—that the benefits 
of such #experiments and the resulting knowledge #outweigh the #risks.
It is more likely that a #pandemic
would occur in #nature, and the need to stay ahead of such a threat
is a primary reason for performing an experiment that might ap-
pear to be risky. However, we must respect that there are genuine
and legitimate #concerns about this type of research, both domes-
tically and globally. We cannot expect those who have these con-
cerns to simply take us, the scientific community, at our word that
the benefits of this work outweigh the risks, nor can we ignore
their calls for greater #transparency, their concerns about conflicts
of interest, and their efforts to engage in a dialog about whether
these #experiments should have been performed in the first place.
Those of us in the scientific community who believe in the merits
of this work have the #responsibility to address these concerns
thoughtfully and respectfully.
### Granted, the time it takes to engage in such a dialog could
potentially delay or even immobilize the conduct of certain im-
portant experiments and the publication of valuable information
that could move the field forward for the good of public health.
Within the research community, many have expressed concern
that important research progress could come to a halt just because
of the fear that someone, somewhere, might attempt to replicate
these experiments sloppily. This is a valid concern. However, al-
though #influenza [[virus]] scientists are the best-informed individuals
about influenza #virus science, and possibly even about the true
level of risk to public health, the [[influenza virus]] research commu-
nity can no longer be the only player in the discussion of whether
certain experiments should be done. #Public opinion (domestic
and global) and the judgments of independent biosafety and bio-
security experts are also critical. If we want to continue this im-
portant work, we collectively need to do a better job of articulating
the scientific rationale for such experiments well before they are
performed and provide discussion about the potential risk to pub-
lic health, however remote. We must also not rule out the possi-
bility that in the course of these discussions, a broad #consensus
might be reached that certain #experiments actually should not be
conducted or reported.
In this regard, as part of an interagency process, the [[U.S. Gov-
ernment]] is planning to augment current policy guidance related
to life sciences dual-use research of concern (DURC) (4) by devel-
oping a framework for strengthening regular institutional review
and oversight of certain life sciences research with high-
consequence pathogens and toxins in order to identify potential
DURC and mitigate risks where appropriate. This #policy imple-
mentation proposal will go well beyond [[H5N1]] [[influenza virus]] to

include 15 pathogens and likely will be modified to include addi-
tional examples of DURC. It will delineate the procedures for the
oversight of DURC and the responsibilities of investigators, re-
search institutions, and the U.S. Government. Ultimately, there
will also be a companion guide to help institutions identify, assess,
manage, and responsibly communicate to the public about
DURC.
With regard to the specific question of whether certain gain-
of-function experiments related to the transmissibility of highly
pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus should be conducted at all,
which addresses directly the issue of the moratorium, the U.S.
Government is planning to host an international workshop before
the end of 2012 with important input from the National Science
Advisory Board for Biosecurity and with global representation,
including those with biosafety and biosecurity expertise, influenza
virus and non-influenza virus scientists, and representatives of the
domestic and global public. The meeting participants will con-
sider general principles concerning the rationale for and risks and
benefits of such experiments and what lines might be drawn in
their conduct and/or reporting.
The game has changed for influenza virus scientists and the
agencies that support them. As researchers, we must realize that
we are critical players in the process of policy and decision making
related to DURC, but we are not the only players. Before embark-
ing on certain types of research, we must ask ourselves critical


questions about whether there are alternative ways to answer the
research questions at hand. When no reasonable alternatives exist,
we must take the scientific approach to making the argument for
conducting such experiments before they are performed. The vol-
untary moratorium on the controversial issue of gain-of-function
research related to the transmissibility of highly pathogenic H5N
influenza virus is providing us the time and space we all need to
work together and get this right, and it should be continued until
we do so (5).
