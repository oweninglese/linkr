By Eepa
 
We have entered a new age of communications over the past 30 years. Our anarchic
forbearers could have only dreamed of our ability to rapidly communicate with 
like minded anarchic people across the world but it is important to remember 
that effective and historically important international networks of solidarity 
and communication have existed as long as anarchic organizing has. When the 
Haymarket Martyrs were killed, the working people of the world spoke out in 
anger as news spread through communications networks. When Ricardo Flores Magon 
languished in a prison cell in the Yuma Territorial Prison, it was people like 
Mother Jones and Emma Goldman who used their networks to speak out and advocate 
for his release. Communications is a force multiplier for radical struggle. It 
enables us to join efforts and create more trouble for those in power than we 
could do as isolated groups of people.
 
Despite the advances in technology, radical communications has not kept pace. 
Sure, many anarchics are aware of other struggles through communiques, news 
reports, or social media posts, but there is a deep rift between these casual 
interactions and meaningful relation building needed for resilient, effective, 
and meaningful struggle.
 
In this brief article, I hope to outline some basic organizational networks, 
communications methods, and essential skills needed to build deeper relations 
with fellow anarchic people in struggle against colonialism, capitalism, and 
domination. Remember, this is only the suggestions of one person. Building 
relations is a deeply complex and often personal affair (when done well). The 
only way you will learn how to do this is by trying.
 
Regional, Continental, International Networks
 
1. Home Region
 
Home region communications should be the most regular form of communications. 
This involves people of a mutually agreed region coming together with regularity
to share upcoming events, discuss regional issues, strategize on ways to combine
efforts when appropriate, and to socialize as people to build bonds. These can 
follow strict rules for security, with only member selected representatives 
forming sub-groups discussing sensitive items when needed. There are guides out 
there discussing methods of organizing sensitive conversations to minimize the 
risk of damage from leaks or informants. Broader social events should minimize 
the sensitivity of the topics to be discussed and should work towards building 
relationships through shared activities (some might want a regional skype 
reading group, some might want to organize field trips, some might want to go 
bar hopping, etc.).

2. Continental & Archipelagic Organizing
 
Continental and Archipelagic organizing really takes place between 
regional/island based networks of cells, collectives, crews, and organizations, 
with continental/archipelagic organizations acting to facilitate these regional 
networks communications into a broader continental/archipelagic context. Regions
can either select a delegation from the region at large or a delegation of 
representatives from each organization to participate in this 
continental/archipelagic communications network. This is used to call for 
material aid (especially when a certain region is undergoing unrest or 
catastrophe), to call for advice, to call for reinforcement, or to announce new 
projects of continental interest. Continental networks also act to ensure that 
the many varied regions, cultures, and political situations have a fast and 
effective means of reaching every other group on the continent, without relying 
on word-of-mouth, algorithms, or news releases.

Media (link #2)] 
 
Physical meetings and movements of material aid in a continental setting will 
naturally be easier due to the connectedness of roads, rail, and land borders. 
Archipelagic meetings and movements of material aid will be much more difficult,
due to compounding struggles to provide affordable ocean-going or aviation based
transportation, evading state naval/marine patrols, port costs, customs, etc., 
and making the time for these more effort and temporal intensive efforts. One of
the most important tasks is to build strong communications infrastructure and 
robust networks or relations. These human relationships can be developed and 
nurtured, all while we start to figure out how to bring back the vital 
oceangoing networks of our ancestors.
 
3. International Solidarity and Action 
 
International networks are really vital for ensuring that our politics do not 
become blind to the tremendously important political developments in other 
continents. So much can be learned from our Indigenous comrades all over the 
colonized world. Too often we let our vision of political thought and our 
ancestral experience in struggle be limited by the horizon. Over the horizon is 
a world of Indigenous people who have been struggling, learning, philosophizing,
creating, and fighting. To not be connected to them is to allow us all to make 
the same mistakes over and over again. It can not be understated how much we can
avoid stumbling blocks by learning from those who have been there and done that.
International networks are also keenly important for ensuring that the relative 
wealth of even poorer comrades in the industrialized regions of the global 
north, gets shared with comrades in dire struggle with access to almost no 
monetary/material resources. We must find ways to ensure that we are getting 
funds and materials to the most dire struggles. This can only be done when we 
have developed resilient relationships with comrades across the globe.

Communication Methods
 
1. Digital 
 
Social media, email, and websites are a good basic way to make contact. Often, 
you will find one or two people from any given region that have a digital 
presence that is in one of the major lingua francas (widely spoken language of 
common communication). Finding one person’s blog, an article with their contact 
email, or a social media account that posts anarchic or anti-colonial content, 
is an opportunity to reach out. They may not be aware of anyone else in their 
region that is also anarchic, but chances are they will. Building a relationship
with even one person will help your organization better understand the political
situation in the region and the needs of people who are organizing there.
 
2. Phone/Ham Radio 
 
Using phone is usually a backup and sometimes more challenging than digital, 
because of the need to speak each others language well enough to communicate the
topics needing to be discussed. Additionally, phones/amateur radios can be a big
security risk in some places, so be mindful.
 
3. In-Person 
 
Organizing trips to build in person relationships can be extremely effective and
can build lasting bonds. Every effective revolutionary movement has made use of 
these types of trips, from American wobblies visiting Magonistas in Mexico, to 
the Zapatistas recent voyage of messengers around the world. Make sure that 
these types of trips are planned to be reciprocal if at all possible. This 
ensures that the relationship building is truly on an even playing field and not
a replication of European missionary saviorship that is so disgusting.
 
Essential Skills
 
1. Language 
 
The primary skill that you can start to develop now is language. If you have a 
dozen comrades in your group, you have enough people to learn lingua-francas for
most of the colonized world. Monolingualism is an ethnonationalist project, 
multilingualism is an internationalist goal. Immigrants will tell you, knowing 
three to five languages at a conversational level is common. You can develop 
this skill.
 
(With respect to English speaking & European revolutionaries): It is an absolute
fact, that developing this skill is a fundamental effort for developing 
meaningful solidarity. Is it acceptable that your comrades abroad speak to you 
in English, yet you can not return this effort to speak in their language? Is it
acceptable that you place the burden of entire translation efforts onto the 
comrades who not only speak your language, but also the language of the people 
you wish to build solidarity with? The business of learning a new language is 
hard work, make no mistake, but it is work that your international comrades have
already been doing.
 
Overlapping languages in a friend group has benefits for networking 
internationally and for mutual learning. It ensures language redundancy, while 
also covering enough language bases to have meaningful international networks. 
Here is an example of a small group language overlapping arrangement:
 
Translation of texts is also an incredibly important task for sharing 
revolutionary thought. Translation into and out of a language ensures that there
is intellectual cross pollination, keeping us from getting stale or replicating 
efforts. Even a poorly translated text is better that no translation at all. 
Having a group of people work on a translation will also dramatically increase 
the quality of the translation. Tools like google translate can be used to get 
the bulk of text translated, with volunteers reading each and making corrections
as they go. This saves time and increases productivity in getting materials into
multiple languages. Overlapping languages also allows a group to perform a 
multitude of translations in relatively short time, making information sharing 
much more timely. 
 
2. Cultural Knowledge
 
Knowledge of culture is an important part of building a relationship. This 
doesn’t mean coming into international communications with preconceived cultural
expectations, but it does mean that you are observant, you ask before assuming, 
and you are adaptive to cultural needs on both sides of the conversation. 
Politically we may not yet be at the same stage of development or we may not 
agree on all of the same political objectives. Ensuring that you are respectful 
of other peoples right to self-determination means that you don’t dictate the 
standards of other peoples struggle or organizing. If something is egregious, 
yes speak up. Make it clear why you do not agree with something. If this is 
something you can work through, good, try. If not, there is no need to 
communicate further with that particular individual or group.
 
3. Mutual Understanding of Boundaries
 
Boundaries, as within all relationships, should be communicated from the start. 
Ensure both parties know and agree to what topics & tactics will and won’t be 
discussed. Ensure both parties agree to mutually beneficial security culture. 
Ensure both parties understand what the forms of communication and language will
be used.
 
In Conclusion: Reaching Out
 
Everything you have in life starts with reaching. A toe dipped in the water 
before you learn to swim, your hand reaching out to grasp a rope you are about 
to climb, the raised hand in greeting of a new face. You take the first step by 
reaching out. Communications and solidarity is no different. Making connections 
is an act of revolutionary faith and solidarity. Take your first language 
lesson. Send a DM to a comrade you respect who doesn’t live in your political 
geography. Sign up for a language exchange. Go to a regional meet-up. Read an 
anarchic/decolonial news blog that isn’t published in English. Start making time
to become more meaningfully connected in true revolutionary solidarity.
