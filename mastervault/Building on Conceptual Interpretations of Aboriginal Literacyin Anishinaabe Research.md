Building on Conceptual Interpretations of Aboriginal
Literacy in Anishinaabe Research:
A Turtle Shaker Model
Brent Debassige
University of Western Ontario
Abstract
This article comes out of the larger context of my doctoral dissertation where I
investigated my experiences as an academic who attempts to remain true to
Indigenous Knowledge (IK) traditions while working within a Western European
intellectual setting. In this current paper, I combine the conceptual frameworks of
Aboriginal literacy and Cavanagh’s (2005) holistic educational model of the
Anishinaabe teaching wand to present a holistic model of Anishinaabe literacy. I
then consider the ethical responsibility of protecting and sustaining IK. Finally, I
share a personal narrative and detail a central model of Anishinaabe literacy—my
carving of a turtle shaker. The turtle shaker model is an applied example of
Anishinaabe literacy that was developed using learning gained from traditional
knowledge and academic environments. The intention is for this model to
facilitate the transformation of how IK is taken up in the academy and in
schooling settings.

Building on Conceptual Interpretations of Aboriginal Literacy in Anishinaabe
Research: A Turtle Shaker Model

This article comes out of the larger context of my doctoral research. My
dissertation (Debassige, 2012) makes its contribution to Indigenous discourse by
providing an examination and analysis of my personal experiences of coming-to-know
Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin (Good Life) and journeying as an oshkabaywis
(ceremonial helper) and academic scholar (oshkabaywis-academic). It has been my
participation in ceremonies that has greatly facilitated my re-conceptualized
understanding of research and literacy. My dissertation presents one pathway for
informing the preparation, conduct, and expression of research grounded in an
Indigenous framework of knowing and includes expressions of Anishinaabe literacy that
I uncovered along the way. Through my research journey, a model and expression of
Indigenous Knowledge (IK) for research that is distinctly Indigenous has emerged. I
refer to this model as the turtle shaker. The purpose of this paper is to share an applied
example of Anishinaabe literacy that relies on learning gained from traditional
knowledge and academic learning environments.
First, I present the concept of Aboriginal literacy and localize it within
Anishinaabe literacy. Next, I discuss my self-referent methodological approach as
framed within Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin (Debassige, 2010). I then describe and
present illustrations of a carved turtle shaker, which is the central example of
Anishinaabe literacy from my dissertation. The shaker, a three-dimensional spiritcentered teaching tool and musical instrument, was designed to deliver knowledge

through oral transmission. In my research, I used it to give context to my data and by
data I mean knowledge bundle. In Indigenous contexts, a knowledge bundle
encompasses a process of gathering, accumulating, carrying, and using knowledge,
information, and sacred items for various purposes in life. Examples of different kinds of
bundles are: 1) poetry, stories, oral history, and songs (McLeod, 2007); 2) themes of
inquiry (Canadian Council on Learning, n.d.); 3) sacred items (Anishnawbe Health
Toronto, n.d.); and 4) power, gifts, and teachings (Benton-Banai, 1988). In research, the
term knowledge bundle encapsulates collected information, including facts and statistics
as in the conventional use of the term data, and privileges the way information,
knowledge, and items are gathered. Therefore, how something is collected, carried, and
used is just as important, perhaps more so, than what is collected.
My discussion of the turtle shaker focuses on two of its parts, the handle and the
head. The shaker handle metaphorically represents my journeying in ceremonial and
academic settings while the shaker head has allowed me to express my experiences at a
sugar bush camp in my home community of M’Chigeeng. While the details of the data
presented in my dissertation will not be discussed in this article, I do make reference to
themes from both data sets. In addition, although the turtle shaker is referenced and
discussed throughout this article, aspects of it are not expressed as part of any written
medium. For example, the actual carved turtle shaker contains mnemonic representations
of traditional songs that are only shared in ceremony or under culturally appropriate
circumstances.
The turtle shaker is of utmost significance in the expression of both my
knowledge and my data. My story can be found in both the actual carving of the shaker

itself—through an oral sharing—and in the conceptual model discussed in this article. In
essence, the turtle shaker is a mnemonic device and functional form of literacy and
expression of spirit-centered data. In my dissertation, I used the turtle shaker literacy as a
thematic topic in the written presentation of data. In this instance, the text of the
dissertation transforms from written to oral and back to written as a way to honor the
integrity of the oral transmission of IK. The oral transmission of IK is generally shared
and adapted to the social context in which it occurs and enables the speaker to respond to
his/her surrounding environment. This deliberate application and inclusion of
Anishinaabe literacy to disseminate knowledge is my effort to contribute to transforming
the ways IK is taken up in the academy and in schooling environments.

Background: Aboriginal Literacy and the Teaching Wand
Aboriginal Literacy
In 1986, the Ontario Community Literacy (OCL) grants program was established
by the Ontario Ministry of Citizenship and Culture, Literacy Branch and contained three
streams of funding: Anglophone, Francophone, and Native (Ministry of Education and
Training, 1993). The OCL grants program was designed with the purpose of improving
“the development and delivery of community-based adult literacy programs and services
for Ontario residents” (p. 5). The year following the commencement of the OCL grants
program invitations were extended by the Literacy Branch staff to various Native people
and organizations in Ontario to discuss literacy issues relevant to Native communities.
From that meeting, the Ontario Native Literacy Coalition (ONLC) was established. One
of the early conferences united various literacy practitioners to discuss perspectives on

Native literacy and to facilitate the creation of curriculum resource materials. After
consulting Native literacy programs in Ontario, the ONLC established the following
definition of Native literacy:

Native literacy is a tool which empowers the spirit of Native people.
Native literacy services recognize and affirm the unique cultures of Native
peoples and the interconnectedness of all aspects of creation. As part of a
life-long path of learning, Native literacy contributes to the development
of self-knowledge and critical thinking. It is a continuum of skills that
encompasses reading, writing, numeracy, speaking, good study habits, and
communicating in other forms of language as needed. Based on the
experience, abilities and goals of learners, Native literacy fosters and
promotes achievement and a sense of purpose, which are both central to
self-determination. (Anderson, 1995, p. 2)

Priscilla George (n.d.) later expanded on this definition in her report on First
Nations Literacy in Ontario suggesting that Aboriginal languages are an essential aspect
of Aboriginal literacy and deeply interrelated with Aboriginal culture. Although reading
and writing in one or both of the official languages has import in Canada, Aboriginal
people place worth on additional factors (George, 2003). In their discussion with
Aboriginal Literacy practitioners, Antone, Gamlin, & Turchetti (2003) found that
“spiritual and emotional literacy” (p.22) were included alongside conventional aspects of
literacy such as reading, writing, and numeracy. Antone et al. also indicated that the

local socio-cultural context of learners is significant in understanding Aboriginal literacy,
especially in naming the world (Freire, 1970/2000). Within this localized context, many
Aboriginal peoples have sustained distinct traditional, or ancestral, ways of knowing that
are part of daily life. Through an Anishinaabe lens, Aboriginal literacy is about living a
good life (mino-bimaadiziwin) and finding ways to revitalize and express traditional
forms of knowledge contemporaneously (Antone, 2003). With these thoughts in mind,
my research localizes Aboriginal literacy from Aboriginal to Anishinaabe by using what I
consider an example of Anishinaabe literacy, the Anishinaabe teaching wand.

The Anishinaabe Teaching Wand
The Anishinaabe teaching wand was first documented by Newberry (1979) as part
of the published proceedings of the Joint International Symposium of Elders and
Scholars. While reporting on his experience during a pipe ceremony, Newberry
witnessed what he referred to as an “Ojibway Teaching Wand” (p. 172). In a diagram,
the wand is illustrated by Newberry as being made of three solid rods that are bound at
the centre point where all three intersect. Two rods cross together at the midway point of
each to form four right angles and each tip symbolizes the four cardinal directions: East
and West, and North and South. The third rod is joined at the midway point and is
perpendicular to the other two and symbolizes Sky and Earth. As a whole, the teaching
wand contains seven points of reference consisting of six directions and one center point

(Newberry, 1979). All of these points of reference are common markers within
Anishinaabe worldview and are usually illustrated on the medicine wheel 1.
Cavanagh (2005) revisited Newberry’s (1979) account of the teaching wand and
presented it as a spherical model for holistic education. Cavanagh relied primarily on his
experiential knowledge in and out of ceremonies which included teachings, stories, and
songs shared by elders and other traditional teachers. Therefore, the proposed
Anishinaabe teaching wand can be positioned as a valuable tool for communicating the
various features of Anishinaabe worldview and for informing the development of
educational programs and curricula. Although in this case there is no definitive account
of traditional teachings or ways of knowing, Cavanagh stressed that participation in the
local context is vital to gaining an understanding of the distinct experience and
worldview of a specific community.
Once the teaching wand is contextualized within an Anishinaabe worldview, the
tool can become a mnemonic device or an expression of Anishinaabe literacy. However,
the teaching wand is not without flaw. Cavanagh (2005) did not comment on the fact that
the teaching wand is only referenced in Newberry’s (1979) writings. In my search of the
literature, I failed to uncover any other mention of it. Moreover, I have never seen or
heard of a teaching wand during my experience in ceremonies over the past decade.
Although Newberry (1979) included two diagrams containing the teaching wand, he only
briefly mentioned its purpose in his description. He alluded to the usage of the teaching
wand when he suggested that “perhaps [the officiant] will use the teaching wand…as his
1

Today, the Medicine Wheel is often used as an organizing frame outside of ceremonies for curriculum
and teaching purposes. For more detail on one explanation of the origin and use of the medicine wheel see
Graveline (1998).

lesson and will speak of the universe” (p. 171). By extension, Newberry situated the
teaching wand as an optional teaching tool that can be used if the officiant, or conductor
of the ceremony, wants to share a teaching. Overall, Newberry revealed very little
information about the wand, its origins, or its use. Is the teaching wand part of the
author’s imagination, or was it a tool that was simply isolated in its usage and a memory
aid for the officiant? Either way, based on both the description of the teaching wand and
what Elders and traditional teachers have shared with me during ceremonies, the
associated teachings and process of learning fit well with Ojibway-Anishinaabe ways of
knowing. In this case, I have been willing to overlook my concerns since the knowledge
associated with the teaching wand can be shared by an IK practitioner within the context
of traditional protocols.
Cavanagh (2005) positioned the teaching wand as a framework containing
essential values, beliefs, and processes that describe one’s education and progression
through life stages. This framework gestures to the compatibility of unifying the
teaching wand with Aboriginal literacy. Combining Aboriginal literacy with the example
of the Anishinaabe teaching wand offers a holistic educational model of Anishinaabe
literacy. When I combine Aboriginal literacy with the educational framework of the
Anishinaabe teaching wand, I am conceptualizing a holistic educational model of
Anishinaabe literacy that is informed by Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin. This model
sets the context for broader application and use in research and a distinct approach for the
dissemination of IK.

Protecting and Sustaining Indigenous Knowledge
My participation and experiences in ceremonies have shaped my approach to
research and have helped me become more critical and sensitive when using IK in the
academy. At the same time, sharing experiences closely interconnected to ceremonial
knowledge has been a challenging task that involves respecting teachings given in
ceremonial environments. This task demands a continual vigilance and comprehensive
understanding about traditional ceremonial knowledge that elicits many questions: what
is shared and when, how it is shared, where it is shared and with whom, and why it is
being shared? The answers to these queries only come with reflection, consultation with
ceremonial people, participation in IK frameworks, and self-reflective actions to uncover
and understand the interrelated aspects and exchanges of IK.
Archibald’s (2008) book, Indigenous Storywork: Educating the heart, mind, body
and spirit, refers to the complex nature of sharing Indigenous stories. Archibald
eschewed the use of textbooks as the primary method of deriving meaning from stories.
Rather, it is important that new storytellers apprentice with knowledge holders to develop
a participatory relationship that is primarily set in the oral tradition. Although
conventional literacy is of value and does have its use, there is no substitute for personal
interaction with knowledgeable storytellers. Archibald’s emphasis on a lived relationship
under the mentorship of elders, family, and other respected community members overlaps
with another significant issue.
Sustaining a lived relationship to stories goes beyond simply being concerned
with writing down knowledge. It includes understanding the implications of potentially
jeopardizing the sustainability of Indigenous oral traditions and ways of learning IK.

Although the wealth of writings about IK that are making their way into print is valuable,
I emphasize the significance of Dumont’s comments printed at the end of the Mishomis
book (as cited in Benton-Banai, 1988):

[T]he recording, or written form, of the sacred teachings of the Midewiwin
has not been an easy decision. However, it has been a decision that was
not easy or taken lightly by Native people who recognized the true
sacredness of these words and the importance of the oral transmission of
these stories. (n.p.)

The words of Dumont, a traditional Midewiwin man, have lead me to consider the what,
when, where, how, and why of sharing Anishinaabe ways of knowing. Keeping alive the
oral traditions, stories, and story meanings within a contemporary context is challenging,
especially in a world subjugated by conventional literacy and influential media including
television, video, and computers (Archibald, 2008). These challenges are compounded
when traditional knowledge is considered.
One of Archibald’s (2008) Elder-participants, Roy Point, related his concern
about certain kinds of traditional knowledge that should not be shared without cultural
authority. Archibald explained that before cultural authority is obtained, a person is
rigorously mentored in traditional ways of knowing and is taught to use and respect the
knowledge learned in a good way. According to Archibald, “putting any of this
knowledge into written form or into another medium was (and still is) considered an
extreme violation of this cultural rule” (p. 78).

B. DEBASSIGE

Like Archibald, I have observed examples of protecting IK and the use of cultural
rules or forms of protocol. These include not allowing photographs and/or tape-recording
of certain cultural activities to occur. For example, a sociocultural event like a powwow
often requires permission to photograph, audio record, or video record people and
activities at the gathering. Communities hosting a powwow will sometimes post signs to
indicate if and under what circumstances photographs and recording are permitted. If
such signs are not present, the Master of Ceremonies may announce the protocol.
Another example includes recording or photographing any parts of ceremonies or
ceremonial-related activities. In such circumstances, the production of photographs and
recordings are typically considered a severe violation of cultural protocol.
Notwithstanding these examples, Indigenous peoples do have non-conventional mediums
that are forms of written records. As Battiste (1986) suggested “through the use of
pictographs, petroglyphs, notched sticks, and wampum, early North American Indians
achieved a form of written communication and recording which served the social,
political, cultural, and spiritual needs of the early period” (p. 25). These early forms of
Aboriginal literacy complemented the oral tradition and served to protect IK.
Safeguarding IK lends to the ethical imperative of establishing the relationship
and significance of acquiring spiritual knowledge in a particular kind of way. This
involves becoming a serious student-practitioner of our ways of knowing in a time when
traditional ways of knowing are in slow recovery and threatened with extinction. I
believe Roy Point, the Elder in Archibald’s (2008) study, alluded to an Indigenous
approach when he stated that “some of the things I said weren’t supposed to be brought
out at all” (p. 78). Archibald connected the Elder’s words to a cultural authority that is

linked to the conditions or the way knowledge is permitted to be shared. Historically,
one reason for this careful sharing relates to concern over respectful handling of
knowledge. For example, Frances Densmore (1987/1928) reported that Midiwiwin
medicine people were known to withhold traditional medicinal knowledge from anyone
including members of their own family. According to Densmore, the Midewiwin would
go to great lengths to keep the medicines secret, including withholding the names of
plants and using aromatic herbs for personal identification purposes. Densmore seemed
to believe that because the participants of her study shared medicine knowledge with her
that the old ways were dying.
However, Castellano (2000) related a more recent illustration while referring to
oral transmission of knowledge, as observed during the Royal Commission on Aboriginal
Peoples (Canada, 1996) proceedings: “Aboriginal people know that knowledge is power
and that power can be used for good or for evil. In passing on knowledge the teacher has
an obligation to consider whether the learner is ready to use the knowledge responsibly”
(p. 26). She further suggested that the inappropriate use of the knowledge is why many
Elders refuse to be recorded or have knowledge transcribed. “Teachers who allow these
things relinquish the possibility of adjusting their teaching to the maturity of the learner
and thereby influencing the ethical use of knowledge” (p. 27). I, too, have noted the
significance of ethical responsibility during my journeying in ceremonies. There is no
question that the method of an ethical responsibility has shifted from one generation to
the next. Nonetheless, as Dumont (as cited by LaDuke, 2002) suggested, the traditional
lifeway of the Anishinaabe will find its meaning in how our contemporaries and future
generations take up the responsibility of reviving and renewing our ways of knowing.

B. DEBASSIGE

Bearing these points in mind, what might a respectful and contemporary Anishinaabe
research approach and literacy model look like?

Methodology
The self-referent approach used in my research is situated within the reconceptualized methodological framework of Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin (for a
detailed explanation see Debassige, 2010). Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin as research
methodology is partially concerned with dislodging the dominant ideology that reifies
Western academic institutions as the knowledge holders of how to appropriately conduct
systematic inquiries. It should be noted that ritualized practice in Anishinaabe
ceremonies existed long before settler societies arrived in the Americas, which makes
Indigenous peoples the original researchers of these territories. Despite settler societies
doing much to trivialize and colonize Indigenous ways of knowing (Smith, 1999),
Indigenous scholars have brought Indigenous research methodologies to the forefront of
contemporary Indigenous scholarship (Absolon, 2011; Archibald, 2008; Kovach, 2009;
Wilson, 2008). Therefore, this article is not about educating individuals about
colonialism and Eurocentric interpretations of IK. Instead, I concur with Smith (2000)
and choose not to waste time and energy reacting to a “politics of distraction” that
centralizes discussion about colonialism and detracts from concentrating on IK. The
intention of my research is to move “beyond deconstruction of oppressive ideologies and
practices to give expression to aboriginal philosophies, worldviews, and social relations”
(Castellano, 2000, p. 23).

17

I unapologetically centre IK as legitimate and worthy of inclusion in scholarly
pursuits, especially research. Furthermore, I give expression and narrative to learning
gained from Anishinaabe ways of knowing as well as higher education that remain true to
IK. My personal narrative is in keeping with Anishinaabe ways of knowing or what
Castellano (2000) called the “personal nature of knowledge”: to speak only of what one
knows. I offer my work as a contribution to the growing discourse in IK and leave it to
Indigenous colleagues, allies, and Indigenous community members to consider its “social
[and spiritual] validity” (Castellano, 2000). Although my work could be framed in the
mainstream literature as an autoethnographic, personal narrative, or self-reflexive inquiry
(Ellis & Bochner, 2000), I have avoided these designations just as I have been inspired by
some aspects of them [e.g., Cole & Knowles’(2000) work on reflexive inquiry]. I remain
steadfast in my primary re-search intention—to look again (Absolon, 2011). I feel this
situates methodology in its appropriate place as a component of the Indigenous storywork
process (Archibald, 2008), which involves narrating, expressing, “seeking, doing,
learning, and living a spirit-centered way in Anishinaabe research” (Debassige, 2010, p.
21).

Sharing and Expressing my Personal Research Journey
through Anishinaabe Literacy
I was living in Toronto, Ontario when I decided to move to my parents’ home to
work on my dissertation. It was a nice break from the big city and being home helped me
refocus. My parents live in the community of M’Chigeeng on Manitoulin Island.

B. DEBASSIGE

Manitoulin Island is situated in the northern part of Lake Huron, south of the
North Channel, and west of Georgian Bay. M’Chigeeng is centrally located on the
Island, nestled in a bay on the North Channel. On either side of M’Chigeeng, to the east
and west, are two bluffs that overlook the entire community.
During the latter part of my childhood and throughout my teenage years, I lived in
M’Chigeeng and grew familiar with the landscape I call home. My parent’s house is
located close to the east bluffs. In my younger days, I camped out, hunted with my dad,
rode my motor bike along trails, and as a summer student I helped build the hiking path
along the bluff. Returning home to M’Chigeeng felt good.
Before beginning the analysis for the dissertation, I decided to engage in a spiritcentered method to guide me. I began by using asemah (tobacco). I felt drawn to the
bluff near my parents’ home and decided to climb to the top in search of direction.
Before leaving my parents’ house, I gathered my bundle of sacred items so that I could
smudge when I reached the top. After climbing the stairs that I helped build as a young
man, I arrived at the top of the cliff overlooking my community. The scenic view of tree
tops and rock formations was as I remembered it—simply amazing. I pulled smudge
items from my bundle and began cleansing myself, as my teachers had modeled for me
many times. I then spoke a prayer and sang two songs in Anishinaabemowin, my Ojibwe
language. I noticed an offering of asemah was wrapped in purple cloth hanging from the
branches of a cedar tree nearby; I assumed this offering had been placed there by a
community member. As I was singing and looking through the branches past the asemah
offering, I saw something else quite extraordinary. A vision of a turtle shaker appeared
through the branches. The shaker was made of a piece of cedar carved into two pieces

and bound together with sinew. Although I could only see one side of the item, I could
see that the shaker handle was about eight inches long and the head took the shape of a
turtle’s back. I was so grateful for this guidance and overjoyed about this contribution to
my work. I thanked Gzhe-manidoo, the Great Spirit, and returned to my parents’ home.
I asked my dad where I could find a dried piece of cedar wood. He took me to a place
where he had cut logs the previous year and I selected a prize piece. I started cleaning
the cedar off its bark and halved the cylindrical mass. As I worked on the shaker, I
reflected on what I saw, pondered about the purpose of the shaker, and wondered about
how it related to the analysis of both of my data sets, which were my personal journeying
and sugar bush data. Deciding not to rush the carving, I put it down temporarily and
returned to the dissertation to reflect upon the data and the meaning of the vision, the
carving, and my experience of going to the bluff. I often returned to the carving to work
on it and reflect on how it informed my research.

The Turtle Shaker Model
My vision of the shaker led to the development of a theory-practice model which
is expressed through a conceptual framework and diagrams, as illustrated below, as well
as through the carving of the turtle shaker itself. I believe that by being open and
attentive to the reciprocal exchange between me and spirit, the shaker’s essence guided
me in the carving of a physical form. This spiritual exchange also informed the
organization of my research and data. Through reflection and analysis, I realized that the
shaker is not only a carving. From an Anishinaabe perspective, the shaker had become a
living entity; it is an active participant in the analysis and co-construction of knowledge.

From a traditional Anishinaabe perspective, sacred items such as shakers, rattles, drums,
stones, and eagle feathers are animated with spirit through ceremony. These animate
objects come to aid traditional people in their spiritual work. Furthermore, the process of
carving involves a reciprocal exchange with spirit and demonstrates how our experiences
of being on the land combined with traditional teachings, spiritual guidance, being
mentored by Elders, community learning, attentive listening, dreams, intuition,
“observation, experience [learning through doing], introspection, and inquiry” (Wheaton,
2000, p. 161) are all aspects that inform and guide our interpretations in daily life.
Inevitably, our interpretations and worldviews shape the analysis of our research. From
this perspective, the carving became a tangible form of Anishinaabe literacy and a central
focus of my doctoral work.
My understanding of a spirit-centered literacy emerged as I carved the turtle
shaker. The process of carving gave me space to make meaning, be conscious of my
good thoughts, and reflect on my experiences. The turtle shaker is not only spiritcentered data; it is also a form of spirit-centered literacy and partners with Indigenous
forms of orality for the purpose of disseminating knowledge.
For the purpose of explaining this contemporary form of Indigenous literacy in
research, two sections of the turtle shaker must be considered. The first section is the
handle (see Figures 2, 3, and 4); the second section pertains to the head (see Figure 5).
The handle of the turtle shaker visually represents (through carvings and related symbols)
my experiences of coming-to-know Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin and journeying as
an oshkabaywis (ceremonial helper). The head of the shaker visually depicts and

organizes the five groupings of Anishinaabe literacy uncovered in the sugar bush camp 2
data set of my dissertation:1) spirit-centered literacy; 2) local community literacies that
include familial knowledge and other local knowledge exchanges; 3) turtle shaker
literacy; 4) literacy of the medicine water; and 5) technological literacy. 3
The journey is symbolized through an image of a spiral to emphasize an
Anishinaabe practitioner’s (oshkabaywis’) ongoing lifelong learning process. Although
much of the knowledge embedded in the turtle shaker is held to oral transmission, I will
explain four sources of inspiration for the design of the turtle shaker’s handle. The first
source was Cavanagh’s (2005) Anishinaabe teaching wand. The second source was the
bimaadizinwin or life symbol, which is located at the Sanilac petroglyphs in Bad Axe,
Michigan. The third source involved my experiences working in ceremonies, listening to
traditional teachings, working with traditional teachers, and my academic participation
(i.e., my experiences of coming-to-know Anishinaabe mino-bimaadizwin and journeying
as an oshkabaywis-academic). The fourth source was the Experiential Learning
Cycle/Spiral reflexive model developed by Cole and Knowles (2000). Three of the four
sources are informed by either Indigenous scholarship or community sites involving IK,
while the fourth non-Indigenous source of inspiration, as described by Cole and Knowles
(2000), allies well with IK.

A sugar bush camp is a shelter usually located in the centre of a large stand of maple trees or a maple
bush. Sap is collected from trees in the spring and cooked under a continuous boil until the water
evaporates and produces maple syrup.

Full explanations of these groupings are beyond the scope of this article and will not be detailed here.
They can be found in my dissertation titled, Re-searching, Expressing (Literacy), and Journeying in
Indigenous Education: Coming-to-Know Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin and the Oshkabaywis-Academic
(Debassige, 2012).

In particular, the bimaadiziwin and the experiential learning life cycle need
further clarification. The bimaadiziwin life symbol originates from a petroglyph found at
a historical site near Bad Axe, Michigan. Petroglyphs are ancient rock engravings that
were carefully etched into our physical landscapes and continue to be significant vehicles
to understanding our Indigenous consciousness and place in the world. A replica of the
petroglyph is on permanent display at the Ziibiwing Cultural Centre in Lansing,
Michigan. Beside the replica of the spiral petroglyph is the following caption:

Bimaadiziwin
Life and All its meaning
The never-ending Circle of Life symbol represents our journey and
connection to all creation.
Many Anishinabek believe that our earthly walk of life is just the
beginning of a long journey. Like the Earth and the Universe, we will
change form, but our spirit will remain the same as we continue on our
journey. On our path, we must walk in a good way with love and respect
for every part of Creation. (Ziibiwing Cultural Centre as cited in Atalay,
2008, p. 40)

To further contextualize the importance of this symbol, Atalay (2008) pointed out that the
spiral represents “the past coming alive in us in the present” (p. 40). As a source of
inspiration, I have reproduced a similar spiral symbol (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Reproduction of the bimaadiziwin life symbol.

This spiral has been carved into the handle of the turtle shaker. My understanding of the
bimaadiziwin life symbol is based in Anishinaabe ways of knowing, being, and doing, as
connected with an Ojibwe-Anishinaabe worldview. The teaching and learning of this
worldview is intimately related to working as a ceremonial helper (oshkabaywis).
Through my helper role, I gained deeper insight and built an intimate introspective
relationship to Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin. I have expressed this ongoing
introspective relationship through the turtle shaker’s reproduced symbol and wood
carving.
The turtle shaker design was also influenced by Cole and Knowles’ (2000)
experiential learning cycle/spiral model which describes a four-stage approach to
reflective teaching and learning. The four stages are as follows: 1) personal experience
and practice; 2) the gathering and documentation of information; 3) the development of
personal theories through reflection and examination; and finally 4) action based on
knowledge. This depiction of ongoing reflexive practice became an aspect of my
Anishinaabe mino-bimadiziwin conceptual framework. The spiraling nature of the model
illustrates an ongoing and reflexive learning process, and its meaning was easily
transferred into the co-creation and related meaning of the turtle shaker handle. In

actuality, the model of the turtle shaker expresses journeying journeys and an emerging
synergism between four sources of knowledge.

The Design of the Turtle Shaker Handle
My four sources of knowledge (i.e., the Anishinaabe teaching wand, the
bimaadiziwin symbol, personal learning experiences, and the Experiential Learning
Cycle/Spiral model) inspired the conceptual design of the handle for the shaker. The
contribution of each of these sources of knowledge became increasingly significant as I
reflected on the literature, reviewed my data, and contemplated the meaning of the turtle
shaker. Once I realized that I could organize and re-conceptualize my journal reflections
data using the turtle shaker’s structure, I decided to sketch accompanying images. These
drawings remained expressions in flux as I began carving the cedar wood. I allowed my
hand to be guided naturally and unrestricted by a prescribed model. This meant
continually working on using asemah to seek guidance, regularly smudging myself and
the carving, carving at specific times, and ongoing reflection.
I began the process of drawing the handle of the shaker independent of its head
(see Figure 2). At the base of the illustration is a sphere symbolizing Cavanagh’s (2005)
teaching wand. From the sphere, a spiral protrusion moves from the base of the handle
toward the head of the shaker. This spiral protrusion was inspired by the experiential
learning cycle/spiral model of Cole and Knowles (2000); it illustrates my coming-toknow Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwn journey as uncovered in my recorded journal
reflections.

It is important to note that the cylindrical movement in the original Cole and
Knowles model moved upward but not outward. The upward movement accounted for
reflexive growth as it pertained to corporeal reality, but it does not account for the
spiritual growth that corresponds with an Anishinaabe spiritual reality. The adapted
upward-widening spiral or cone-like shape of the shaker’s handle (see Figure 3) better
represents and builds on the dual expression of one reality, the physical realm and
spiritual realm in synergy (Dumont, 1976/1992).

The bimaadizwin life symbol is also incorporated in an effort to illustrate the spiraling
nature of my growth and the spiritual learning I experienced during my coming-to-know

journey as an oshkabaywis-academic. Figure 4 illustrates the spiral-like nature that
exemplifies gradual growth through four stages toward the head of the shaker.

Figure 4. Drawing of shaker handle, part three.

The spiral also represents the ongoing process of learning and growth that occurs as one
continues to put their hands to the work of being a practitioner of Anishinaabe minobimaadiziwin and journeying as an oshkabaywis-academic.

The Design of the Head of the Turtle Shaker
The head of the shaker symbolizes the back of a turtle (see Figure 5) and serves to
organize my sugar camp experiences. My learning and identification as a traditional
Midewiwin and Sundancer, combined with my recorded reflections, facilitated an
understanding of how the turtle shell could serve to organize the sugar camp related data.
The sugar camp is a complete example of a holistic educational model and a form of
Anishinaabe literacy. A brief description of how I organized the sugar camp data set
follows.

Figure 5. The head of the shaker (the turtle’s back).

I continually returned to the data and the vision of the turtle shaker to better
understand how I should proceed. Dreams, intuitive moments, and time on the land
among all-our-relations became integral parts of the process. These methods supported
me through this exhausting work and helped me to stay focused and meditate on what I
was being guided to do. Gradually, the organization of the data became clearer, and I had
a foundation for approaching the data. Although there were some slight variations as I
began to divide the data into themes, the initial organization remained fairly consistent.
Following the pathway from bottom to top, each literacy theme represents a
section down the center of the turtle’s back. The themes are as follows: spirit-centered
literacies, local community literacies that include familial knowledge and other local

knowledge exchanges, turtle shaker literacy, literacy of the medicine water, and
technological literacies. My mother and father were large contributors to the sugar camp
experience and are located on the right and left sides of the shell respectively. Their
positions on the shell symbolically represent local community contributions of both men
and women. The outer circle represents knowledge stemming from outside the local
community. The double-sided arrows on the turtle’s back indicate the flow of knowledge
occurring in and out of the community and how these knowledges inform various
literacies.
In my research I used an Anishinaabe spirit-centered approach when organizing
my data for analysis. Through this approach, the vision of a turtle shaker emerged as a
complementary way to disseminate and organize my data. My learning in ceremonies
informed my understandings about the turtle and taught me to use asemah to seek
guidance in the research process. I took time to carefully reflect on the various ways of
applying the turtle to the organization of the data. Coming-to-know Anishinaabe minobimaadiziwin and journeying as an oskabaywis-academic provided me with the
conceptual lens to uncover links between the turtle shaker and collected data. While the
handle of the shaker was used to illustrate my learning, the upper shell of the turtle shaker
is used as a conceptual model to organize the sugar bush data. Through the data I
collected both from my experiences of coming-to-know Anishinaabe mino-bimaadiziwin
and my journeying as an oshkabaywis-academic, I began the process of building a
relationship to learning, understanding, and participating in Anishinaabe literacy.

Conclusion
When I moved home to M’Chigeeng and began thinking about and conducting
Aboriginal literacy research, the community provided me with many applied examples of
local Anishinaabe literacy. Although my work is introspective and was initiated through
many interrelated Anishinaabe literacy projects, it builds on Hare’s (2005) research
where she contextualized several generations of her local community in relation to
Anishinaabe literacy. I have extended this work by revitalizing the contextualization of
Aboriginal literacy research through my personal journeying in ceremonies and my
research in a sugar bush camp. This work is brought to life through the application of the
IK processes of learning and transmitting knowledge by way of the turtle shaker. In
order for the meaningful cyclical reading and writing of the land to continue, younger
generations must be given opportunities in schooling environments to take up the work of
sustaining IK for future generations in culturally responsive ways.
Creating curriculum that facilitates the learning of Anishinaabe literacy involves
combining ecological knowledge with our worldviews. The sugar bush project briefly
referred to in this article is an example of this type of curriculum. There is need to
conduct further research that explicates the value of Anishinaabe traditional knowledge
alongside outdoor educational programming. In addition, much research is needed in the
area protecting and sustaining traditional IK. Aboriginal literacy provides one approach
for how knowledge can be shared but traditional knowledge holders must be included to
teach how the respectful sharing of knowledge can be achieved. A practitioner
relationship to IK requires patience and steady persistence but the knowledge gained is
well worth the journey.
