### The #Covid-19 pathogen has a [[genetic footprint]] that has never been observed in a natural #[[coronavirus]].
By [[Steven Quay]] and [[Richard Muller]]

## The possibility 
that the [[pandemic]] began with an escape from the [[Wuhan Institute of Virology]] is attracting fresh attention. President [[Biden]] has asked the national intelligence community to redouble efforts to investigate.

Much of the public discussion has focused on circumstantial evidence: mysterious #illnesses in late [[2019]]; the lab’s work intentionally supercharging #viruses to increase lethality (known as “[[gain of function]]” research). The [[Chinese Communist Party]] has been reluctant to release relevant information. Reports based on [[U.S.]] intelligence have suggested the lab collaborated on projects with the [[Chinese military]].

But the most compelling reason to favor the[[ lab leak]] hypothesis is firmly based in science. In particular, consider the #genetic #fingerprint of [[CoV-2]], the [[novel coronavirus]] responsible for the #disease [[COVID-19]]. 

In #gain-of-function research, a #microbiologist can increase the #lethality of a [[coronavirus]] enormously by splicing a special sequence into its genome at a prime location. Doing this leaves no trace of #manipulation. But it alters the #virus [[spike protein]], rendering it easier for the [[virus]] to inject #genetic material into the victim cell. Since [[1992]] there have been at least 11 separate #experiments adding a special #sequence to the same location. The end result has always been #supercharged #viruses.

## A [[genome]] 
is a #blueprint for the factory of a cell to make proteins. The language is made up of three-letter “words,” 64 in total, that represent the 20 different [[amino acids]]. For example, there are six different words for the [[amino acid]] [[arginine]], the one that is often used in #supercharging #viruses. Every [[cell]] has a different preference for which word it likes to use most.

In the case of the [[gain-of-function]] supercharge, other #sequences could have been [[spliced]] into this same site. Instead of a #CGG-CGG (known as “[[double CGG]]”) that tells the #protein factory to make two #arginine [[amino acids]] in a row, you’ll obtain equal #lethality by #splicing any one of 35 of the other two-word combinations for double #arginine. If the insertion takes place naturally, say through recombination, then one of those 35 other sequences is far more likely to appear; #CGG is rarely used in the class of #coronaviruses that can recombine with #CoV-2.

In fact, in the entire class of #coronaviruses that includes #CoV-2, the #CGG-CGG combination has never been found naturally. That means the common method of #viruses picking up new skills, called #recombination, cannot operate here. A #virus simply cannot pick up a #sequence from another virus if that sequence isn’t present in any other #virus.

Although the double [[CGG]] is suppressed naturally, the opposite is true in laboratory work. The insertion #sequence of choice is the double CGG. That’s because it is readily available and convenient, and scientists have a great deal of experience #inserting it. An additional advantage of the [[double CGG]] sequence compared with the other 35 possible choices: It creates a useful beacon that permits the #scientists to track the #insertion in the #laboratory.

## Now the damning fact. 
It was this exact sequence that appears in #CoV-2. Proponents of [[zoonotic]] origin must explain why the novel #[[coronavirus]], when it mutated or recombined, happened to pick its least favorite combination, the double CGG. Why did it #replicate the choice the lab’s #gain-of-function #researchers would have made?

Yes, it could have happened #randomly, through #mutations. But do you believe that? At the minimum, this fact—that the #[[coronavirus]], with all its random possibilities, took the #rare and #unnatural combination used by human researchers—implies that the leading theory for the #origin of the [[coronavirus]] must be laboratory escape.

When the lab’s [[Shi Zhengli]] and colleagues published a paper in [[February 2020]] with the virus’s partial #genome, they omitted any mention of the special sequence that supercharges the virus or the rare [[double CGG]] section. Yet the #fingerprint is easily identified in the data that accompanied the paper. Was it omitted in the hope that nobody would notice this evidence of the #gain-of-function #origin?

But in a matter of weeks virologists [[Bruno Coutard]] and colleagues [published](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339153857_The_spike_glycoprotein_of_the_new_coronavirus_2019-nCoV_contains_a_furin-like_cleavage_site_absent_in_CoV_of_the_same_clade) their discovery of the sequence in #CoV-2 and its novel supercharged site. Double CGG is there; you only have to look. They comment in their paper that the protein that held it “may provide a #gain-of-function” capability to the virus, “for efficient spreading” to #humans.

## There is additional scientific evidence 
that points to CoV-2’s #gain-of-function origin. The most compelling is the dramatic differences in the genetic diversity of #CoV-2, compared with the [[coronaviruses]] responsible for #SARS and #MERS.

Both of those were confirmed to have a #natural #origin; the [[viruses]] evolved rapidly as they spread through the human population, until the most [[contagious forms]] dominated. #Covid-19 didn’t work that way. It appeared in #humans already adapted into an extremely #contagious version. No serious viral “improvement” took place until a minor variation occurred many months later in #England.

Such early #optimization is #unprecedented, and it suggests a long period of #adaptation that predated its [[public spread]]. Science knows of only one way that could be achieved: [[simulated natural evolution]], growing the virus on human cells until the optimum is achieved. That is precisely what is done in [[gain-of-function]] research. #Mice that are genetically modified to have the same #coronavirus receptor as #humans, called “[[humanized mice]],” are repeatedly exposed to the virus to encourage adaptation.

The presence of the [[double CGG]] #sequence is strong #evidence of [[gene splicing]], and the absence of #diversity in the public #outbreak suggests #gain-of-function acceleration. The scientific evidence points to the conclusion that the #virus was developed in a #laboratory.
