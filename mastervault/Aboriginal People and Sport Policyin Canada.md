The Double Helix:
Aboriginal People and
Sport Policy in Canada

I

n 2005, the federal government, through Canadian Heritage,
released Sport Canada’s Policy on Aboriginal Peoples’ Participation
in Sport (Canadian Heritage, 2005).1 It was a prolonged process,
set in motion by a formal declaration of support from the federal­
provincial/territorial ministers responsible for sport, recreation and
fitness in 2002 and concluded with the public release of the document
three years later. During that time, a number of representatives from
relevant sectors including Canadian Heritage, Sport Canada, Indian
and Northern Affairs, Aboriginal Affairs, Justice Canada, Health
Canada, the Aboriginal Sport Circle (ASC, the national organization
for Aboriginal sport development in Canada) and academe (including
both authors) shared in its construction.
It was a remarkable time to be involved in Aboriginal sport. The
initiation of the policy process signalled a major milestone in govern­
ment support for Aboriginal sport in Canada, while the output of
that process—the policy—remains, at the time of writing this chapter,
the only strategy of its kind in the world. Even in Australia, where
substantial human and financial resources have been allocated for
Aboriginal sport development, no such policy exists.2 In this regard,
the Canadian government can reasonably state that it is making a
genuine effort to create a “dynamic and leading-edge sport environ­
ment” (Sport Canada, 2002a, p. 4) that meets the needs and interests
of its constituent groups, in this case Aboriginal people.

POLICY ISSUES

As one of three policies dealing with access and equity issues
for underrepresented groups in sport (the other two being persons
with disabilities, and women and girls), the Aboriginal sport policy
is significant: it is the primary instrument guiding Sport Canada’s
efforts as it works with other governments and sport organizations to
tackle the inequities that limit Aboriginal people from gaining access
to and maintaining their involvement in sport. As a direction-setting
agenda for government, the policy deserves attention if “we are to
reach our destination” by “pulling together in the same direction,”
as cited by an elder at an Aboriginal Sport Circle presentation at the
2005 Ministers’ Conference in Regina, Saskatchewan (Daniels, 2005).
To do so, important questions about the background, creation and
implementation of this policy need to be addressed. For instance,
what broader social, political and economic factors contributed to its
development? Why did it take three years to construct? What priority
areas have received the most attention? What areas are missing from
the strategy? Seeing as the policy was to be reviewed in 2010, and an
action plan to guide its implementation was never publicly released,
how would the federal government measure its success?
In this chapter, we examine the key issues surrounding the
development and implementation of the Aboriginal sport policy,
and through that process respond to the questions raised above. The
chapter is divided into four parts. In the first section, we outline our
approach to understanding Aboriginal sport and policy development
in Canada. Here, we use the concept of the ‘double helix’ to exam­
ine the relationship between the mainstream and the Aboriginal
sport system. We then link that concept to Gidden’s (1984) theory of
structuration to explain how individuals make decisions that enable
and constrain their ability to achieve their desired goals for sport.
The second section focuses on the background and objectives of the
policy, and includes an overview of the key social, political, and
economic factors that played a role in its development. The third sec­
tion provides an analysis of the current issues and limitations of the
policy while calling attention to the opportunities and challenges it
presents. In the fourth and final section, we summarize our thoughts
about the Aboriginal sport policy and offer some recommendations
about how to improve its implementation.
Examples and reflections based on our own experiences with
the development and implementation of the policy are interspersed
throughout the text. The first author was a member of the working

group that negotiated the overall objectives and scope of the policy,
was the primary person responsible for consulting with Aboriginal
sport leaders in Ontario on its parameters, and along with the second
author, edited various sections of the document. We believe that our
personal insights are important to share with students and scholars
because they provide a deeper understanding of the context in which
policies take shape, as well as the boundaries in which historically
marginalized groups, like Aboriginal people, seek to achieve their
desired goals for sport.

Theoretical Framework
The Double Helix
Our starting point for examining Sport Canada’s Policy on Aboriginal
Peoples’ Participation in Sport (Canadian Heritage, 2005) is derived
from a universal model in the biological sciences, the double helix.
The anatomy of a double helix consists of parallel strands stabilized
by cross-links. The parallel strands represent the mainstream and the
Aboriginal sport system, each operating independently of the other.
The cross-links represent the sites where the two systems connect.
Our inspiration for beginning here comes from Alex Nelson, a lead­
ing figure in the Aboriginal sport movement in Canada, who used
the model to explain the relationship between the mainstream and
the Aboriginal sport system to federal representatives throughout
the policy-making process. Though the double helix is not the only
way to portray the relationship, it was nevertheless a central unifying
concept throughout discussions related to the development of the
policy.3 Thus, the model served as a discursive element structuring
the way people imagined the two sport systems in relation to one
another, while at the same time providing an effective way of com­
municating the existence of an alternative sport system, characterized
by specific sites where Aboriginal sport connects to, and remains
distinct from, the mainstream sport model.
There are at least three key benefits to using the double helix
model when discussing the relationship between the Aboriginal
and mainstream sport system. First, as a familiar and easy image
to grasp, it is useful for facilitating complicated dialogues about the
philosophical underpinnings and political objectives that differenti­
ate the two systems. A case in point is the way in which Aboriginal
people use sport to assist their broader goals for self-determination.

POLICY ISSUES

For many Aboriginal people, self-determination is fundamentally
about having the right to make decisions on how to live and govern
themselves as a people, and having those efforts supported by gov­
ernment through equitable resource allocation (Royal Commission on
Aboriginal Peoples, 1996). In his statement to the Royal Commission
on Aboriginal Peoples, René Tenasco, Councillor for Kitigan Zibi
Anishnabeg Council, said, “Self-determination is looking at our
desires and our aspirations of where we want to go and being given
the chance to attain that . . . for life itself, for existence itself, for
nationhood itself . . .” (Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples,
1996, p. 108). Although not applied directly to sport, Tenasco’s understanding of self-determination captures the essence of the way we
wish to frame that concept. Our point about the relationship between
the double helix model and self-determination is illustrated by the
history of the Northern Games, an annual competition comprised
mostly of traditional Inuvialuit activities. The Northern Games
were established in July 1970 in part as a response to the rejection,
by organizers, of a request that they incorporate Inuvialuit games
into the inaugural Arctic Winter Games in March 1970 (Paraschak,
1991). The Arctic Winter Games are similar to the Canada Games
in that they are a government-controlled spectacle featuring main­
stream sport events, albeit limited to circumpolar teams only. As a
counter-hegemonic initiative, the Northern Games were developed
to provide opportunities for indigenous northerners to participate in
their traditional games and dances, and thus pass on their cultural
values and skills to the youth—an objective that is apparent in the
following statement from the organizers: “Through the Northern
Games youth discover the rich history they have inherited from their
ancestors, and take pride in their cultural heritage” (Gordon, 2009).
These Games, created and administered by indigenous northerners,
are thus an example of Aboriginal self-determination in sport.
Second, the model of the double helix is useful for the way it
positions Aboriginal sport practices and the Aboriginal sport system
as a separate and equally legitimate sport system that is worthy of
government funding—a position that authorities in the mainstream
system have repeatedly challenged and rejected. Tensions surround­
ing competing visions for ‘sport’ during the life of the Native Sport
and Recreation Program (herein NSRP) are instructive. Established in
1972 by Fitness and Amateur Sport, a unit of the federal government’s
Ministry of National Health and Welfare, the NSRP was designed

The Double Helix

to increase sport and recreation opportunities for Aboriginal people
on and between reserves throughout the country (Paraschak, 1995).
For almost 10 years the program flourished as Aboriginal organizers
co-ordinated local, regional and national-level activities in a wide
range of events from popular mainstream activities like basketball,
hockey, and rodeo, to sport and cultural events like Métis Days and
Indian Summer Games. However, friction over the legitimate vision
for sport between Aboriginal and federal sport leaders continued
throughout the lifetime of this program. In keeping with this ongo­
ing debate, in 1978, Fitness and Amateur Sport sent the Northern
Games Association a letter that stated funding would be reduced
and then stopped by 1981 because the mainstream activities in the
Arctic Winter Games fit better with the department’s mandate for
sport development than did the traditional activities performed in the
Northern Games (Paraschak, 2004). Then, in 1981, the federal govern­
ment terminated the NSRP when it shifted its priorities towards high
performance sport and away from recreation, which federal officials
saw as the mandate of the provincial/territorial level of government.
Similar to the rationalization provided to the Northern Games
Association several years earlier, federal officials had determined
that the range of activities fostered through the NSRP fell outside
the scope of sport activities supported by Fitness and Amateur Sport,
and, furthermore, that those activities would not produce the high
performance results desired by government (Paraschak, 1995).
Third, the double helix model conveys movement between
the two systems, showing how the Aboriginal sport system con­
nects and contributes to the Canadian mainstream system—just
as the Canadian mainstream system connects and contributes to
the Aboriginal sport system, albeit in an unequal system of power
relations. This movement is evident in dialogues around a parallel
system in official reports and policies leading up to and including
the Aboriginal sport policy. One of the first reports to do so was
Sport in Canada—Everybody’s Business, Leadership, Partnership and
Accountability4 (Mills, 1998). This report included a recommendation
to enhance coaching development for Aboriginal people, thereby
supporting the ASC’s perspective that coaching was a “cornerstone
of the emerging Aboriginal sport delivery system” (Mills, 1998, p. 87).
In so doing, members of the committee responsible for writing the
report were supporting the right of Aboriginal people to create a
separate sport delivery system aligned with their vision of sport.

POLICY ISSUES

It was thus surprising to read in the eighth draft of the Aboriginal
sport policy that:
Aboriginal Peoples in Canada have worked diligently for several
years to bring the major barriers concerning Aboriginal Peoples’
participation in sport to the attention of both government and
the Canadian sport system. Although this movement has made
an impact on the healthy, active lifestyles of Aboriginal youth,
the ultimate vision of broad-based participation of Aboriginal
Peoples in the Canadian sport system will need to be achieved
through the committed, cooperative effort of Aboriginal Peoples,
the Canadian sport community and all levels of government.
There is no desire to create a distinct sport system for Aboriginal
Peoples. (Canadian Heritage, 2003, p. 3, emphasis added)

We assume that this statement means the “emerging Aboriginal sport
system” identified and supported in the 1998 report is not considered
legitimate by the federal, provincial and territorial sport administra­
tors. Certainly, the fact that Aboriginal people have actively created
a distinct sport system over the last 40 years—as outlined in the
section on background and objectives—is evidence of their desire to
do so.
Duality of Structure
While the double helix provides a clear and common visual for
representing the relationship between the two systems, it does not
explain how or why the two systems came into contact, how the
links were strengthened or destabilized over time, or how decisions
about which aspects of each system should be enhanced or ignored
were made. In light of this, we turn to Giddens (1984) to examine
the relationship between individual and collective agency and the
seemingly organized, enduring patterns of social life. We are par­
ticularly interested in his concept of ‘duality of structure’ to help
explain the way agents, whether as individuals or groups, are able to
gain access to, take advantage of, and shape the rules and resources
to secure better positions for themselves in sport. It is worth noting
that within this framework agents do not have to be aware of their
actions or even be able to verbalize how they know what they know,
for a great deal of their competence is based on their lived experience,
or what Giddens (1984) referred to as their “practical consciousness.”

The Double Helix

In this chapter, we use duality of structure to examine the ways that
Aboriginal people, through their ongoing actions, have responded
to and shaped the sport system around them, and how they did this
within the boundaries of what they believed (through lived experi­
ence) was possible. Viewing the double helix model from the point
of view of duality of structure thus calls attention to the ways that
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people are impacted by each other’s
ideas and actions.
Sport as a Socially-Constructed Practice
Our theoretical positioning of the double helix is further linked to
our understanding of sport as a cultural practice. If culture, sim­
ply defined, is the “way of life” of a people (Williams, 1983), then
Aboriginal people in Canada have their own cultural practices that
in part align with, but also differ from, other Canadians. Essential to,
though not explicit in, this definition is the assumption that people
have the right to shape their own cultural practices in ways that
provide meaning for them. For example, in The Constitution Act, 1982,
existing Aboriginal rights are identified as a legitimate part of the
Canadian political framework. In other words, Aboriginal people in
Canada did not give up their status as separate nations when Canada
was formed. This truth has been reinforced through various court
decisions where Aboriginal rights and treaty rights have been upheld
or created anew, as with the Nisga’a Treaty in British Columbia. 5
Aboriginal people thus have a unique status in Canada, a justifica­
tion that underlies their differential treatment from other identifiable
groups in the country.
Furthermore, we understand sport to be a “socially-constructed”
practice, which is to say that sport practices are constantly being
produced, reproduced, and reshaped by individuals and groups
acting within the boundaries of what they think are possible. These
boundaries, including the rules for how things work and the distribu­
tion of resources needed to achieve the desired objectives thus con­
tinuously shape, and are shaped by, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
people. Those who make the rules have more power because they
can decide what the rules will be and how the resources will be dis­
tributed. These individuals get to legitimize their preferred forms of
sport, their preferred sport traditions and the meanings and practices
associated with dominant sport forms (Gruneau, 1988). Over time, the
ways that sport is constructed as a cultural practice become part of

POLICY ISSUES

most peoples’ practical consciousness as they naturalize that this is
‘the proper’ way to organize and participate in sport. Unequal power
relations thus lie at the base of this process because those who get to
shape the rules ultimately have a better chance of naturalizing their
way of doing sport as the way that sport will be reproduced and
understood. These unequal relations exist within Aboriginal sport,
but they also exist between different groups within the mainstream
system, including Aboriginal sport leaders and government. This lat­
ter group currently has greater access to desired resources and is more
able to shape and implement its desired goals for sport. Policies, such
as the Aboriginal sport policy, accelerate and crystallize this natural­
izing process based on unequal power relations, further institutional­
izing sport practices in a manner that best fits with those defining and
benefiting most from the development and implementation of policies.

Background and Objectives
Background
Policies are constructed at every level of government, from the local
to the federal. As decision-making instruments, they help to define
a particular course of action for a specific issue, such as racism in
competitive sport, or for a bundle of related issues, as with prob­
lems concerning equity and access for Aboriginal people and sport.
Equally important, policies also render visible, by way of exclusion,
areas that will not receive systematic attention, thus institutionalizing
a legitimized direction for how human, financial, and infrastructural
resources will be deployed (Pal, 2010).
The level of authority given to a policy determines how govern­
ment can respond to any given situation. Similar to the policy for
women and girls in sport, and sport for persons with a disability,
the Aboriginal sport policy is a departmental policy, situated in
Sport Canada, the administrative authority responsible for sport
development throughout the country. As a departmental policy
it enables vertical relationships within the department where it is
located; that is, Canadian Heritage. More specifically, Sport Canada
is a branch of the International and Intergovernmental Affairs sec­
tor, one of five divisions in the Department of Canadian Heritage.
Established in 1993, Canadian Heritage is responsible for “national
policies and programs that promote Canadian content, foster cul­
tural participation, active citizenship and participation in Canada’s

civic life, and strengthen connections among Canadians” (Canadian
Heritage, 2009d). Within the context of Canadian Heritage, sport is
viewed as a means to enhance national identity, social inclusion,
and citizenship.
Herein lies a significant problem we see with the Aboriginal
sport policy: as a departmental strategy, the Aboriginal sport policy
can refer to—but not directly address—an array of important issues
tied to Aboriginal sport development, including weight loss and
obesity prevention, diabetes, suicide, substance abuse, justice and
education. These issues are vitally connected to Aboriginal sport
development but are beyond the scope of what Sport Canada and
Canadian Heritage have been empowered to tackle, and thus would
play no role in the implementation or evaluation of this policy. Only
select policies, such as the Federal Policy for Hosting International Sport
Events (Canadian Heritage, 2008), incorporate accountability across
federal departments. Had the Aboriginal sport policy been structured
as a federal rather than a departmental policy, it could have permit­
ted horizontal relationships among relevant federal government units
such as Health Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs, and Justice,
as well as vertical relationships within Canadian Heritage thereby
allowing the issues to be addressed in a more holistic fashion.
To be sure, several federal departments were involved to a
limited extent in policy discussions. Their presence thus held prom­
ise for enhanced structural relations. However, these relationships
were never institutionalized through the policy framework. Instead,
federal sport officials ‘hoped’ the policy would facilitate horizontal
relations across departments by allowing their representatives to
partially engage in meetings about the policy. We will return to the
limitations of a departmental policy in the following section. For now,
it is enough to say that the greater the number of partnerships, the
greater the range and amount of resources that can be made available
for programs and activities thereby helping to create a more effective
policy situation. In other words, with multiple federal stakeholders
addressing a variety of issues connected to sport, a policy is given
more force in terms of being able to achieve its goals.6
As with all policies, the Aboriginal sport policy must be under­
stood as the result of a long period of focused attention and promo­
tion by interest groups whose concerns are tied to patterns they see
in the broader social, political and economic environment. Related
social concerns, for example, arose from statistics outlining the poor

POLICY ISSUES

quality of life faced by many Aboriginal people in Canada (e.g., Mills,
1998), combined with recognition that Aboriginal people perceived
sport as a way to counteract negative behaviours in their communi­
ties, especially for the youth. Political concerns were strengthened by
the desire of the federal government to improve its relationship with
Aboriginal people more generally, as could be seen in their estab­
lishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. The final
lengthy report, published in 1996, included a number of recommen­
dations specific to sport. As well, the two Speeches from the Throne
prior to the release of the Aboriginal sport policy also stressed the
federal priority “to work with Aboriginal Peoples so that they can
participate fully in national life as well as share in Canada’s pros­
perity” (Canadian Heritage, 2006, p. 1). Broader economic concerns,
tied to increasing levels of physical inactivity and the costs to health
care this created, made addressing the health of Canadians through
increased sport participation more attractive. A commitment by all
governments to reduce inactivity among Canadians by 10% by 1993
(Canadian Heritage, 2005, p. 10) necessitated action across the country
and amongst its many constituents, including Aboriginal people.
Sport-specific concerns provided an additional impetus for the
creation of this policy. In his detailed report on the use of banned
substances in sport, prompted by the scandal surrounding Canadian
sprinter Ben Johnson at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, Korea,
Charles Dubin (1990) identified a moral crisis in Canadian sport
that required a re-examination of its values. He recommended that
government funding should be based not on medal counts but rather
on ethical principles, such as the extent to which programs are avail­
able to the broader community, and the encouragement of women,
minorities, the disadvantaged, and the disabled in sport (Jennings,
1990). Also in 1990, the inaugural North American Indigenous Games
(NAIG) were held in Edmonton: these Games became a cornerstone
of the emerging Aboriginal sport system. In the federal report, Sport:
The Way Ahead (Minister’s Task Force, 1992), a national body for
Aboriginal sport was recommended. In 1995, that recommendation
became a reality with the creation and federal funding of the ASC.
Provincial and territorial Aboriginal sport bodies (PTASBs) soon
followed, at times receiving funding from their mainstream govern­
ment counterparts. Aboriginal requests for funding to prepare and
send provincial and territorial teams to the NAIG became an issue all
levels of government needed to address. As pointed out in the Mills

The Double Helix

Report (1998), governments were having to respond to an emerging
Aboriginal sport system, which in and of itself was an outcome of
both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal actions.
In 1995, the federal and provincial/territorial ministers respon­
sible for sport, recreation and fitness recommended a focus be placed
on the physical activity needs in Aboriginal communities (Canadian
Heritage, 2005). Two years later, the ASC reported to the ministers
about the barriers affecting Aboriginal sport participation, and they
agreed to tackle the issues. Contributing to this heightened concern
for addressing Aboriginal sport, two roundtables were held as part of
the process leading to the creation of the Canadian Sport Policy (CSP)
(Sport Canada, 2002a), the overarching policy for sport development
in Canada. The February 2000 National Recreation Roundtable on
Aboriginal/Indigenous Peoples produced the Maskwachees Declaration
(Federal-Provincial/Territorial Advisory Committee, 2000). This docu­
ment outlined strengths and challenges facing Aboriginal involve­
ment in physical activity, physical education, sport and recreation,
and called on governments and the non-profit sector to endorse the
Declaration. A roundtable later that year focused on elite athletics
and Aboriginal people.
In terms of federal support, the 2002 CSP outlined all 13 govern­
ments’ commitment to a values-based approach to sport, including
equity and access for underserved groups. This federal commit­
ment was repeated in Bill C-12, An Act to Promote Physical Activity
and Sport, released in 2003 (Parliament of Canada, 2003). One of the
underserved groups was Aboriginal people. Federal funding was
attached to the CSP, and bilateral agreements created a structure
for distributing new resources across the country in keeping with
the priorities identified in the policy. These factors all provided an
impetus for the creation of Sport Canada policies promoting access
and equity for underserved groups, the first of which became the
Aboriginal sport policy.
A three-year process followed to craft the eventual policy,
and involved multiple partners, including provincial and territorial
government representatives who did not wish to see the legitima­
tion of a distinct Aboriginal sport system in the policy, as this could
lead to a parallel Aboriginal sport system that would compete with
the mainstream sport system for limited resources. It was, for many
supporters of the double-helix model, a frustrating process. One
participant explained:

POLICY ISSUES

We tried to get that [acceptance of a parallel system] into the
policy; we tried to put that explanation into the policy. They [the
government officials] appreciated the values of those models in
understanding why we are different; [but] they absolutely refused
to include that in the document. It was actually in the initial draft
but as it worked its way up through the food chain people became
very uncomfortable about that. (Te Hiwi, 2009, p. 124)

Eventually, after prolonged debates with government officials, as
well as many edits to the policy, an Aboriginal sport system was
formally recognized in the document in the guiding principles that
stated, “An Aboriginal sport delivery system exists and it is impor­
tant to work with the ASC, its national body, to identify and address
the areas of priority to advance Aboriginal Peoples’ participation
in sport” (Canadian Heritage, 2005, p. 6). Then, consultation with
Aboriginal groups on the eighth draft of the policy resulted in con­
cerns being raised over the scope of ‘sport’ in the policy. Aboriginal
respondents voiced their commitment to a holistic approach to sport
(and life more generally); however, this contradicted mainstream
notions of Sport Canada’s mandate. In the end, the policy makers
acknowledged the unique holistic approach taken by Aboriginal
people to sport in the policy, but they did not incorporate that under­
standing, using the model of the double helix, into the structures
created through the policy.
Objectives
By now it should be clear that policies are not neutral instruments
(Pal, 2010). Rather, they are developed and implemented to address
specific issues that have been identified as needing attention. How
those issues are addressed within the context of each policy var­
ies according to its design. For example, some policies have objec­
tives (or goals) while others do not. The approach can vary for a
number of reasons. A case in point is Actively Engaged: A Policy on
Sport for Women and Girls (Canadian Heritage, 2009a). As discussed
in Chapter XI, several policy objectives are identified to address
federal priorities in this area. The objectives for Actively Engaged are
explained in more detail in the Action Plan, 2009–2012 (Canadian
Heritage, 2009b) that accompanies the policy.
In comparison, Sport Canada’s Policy on Aboriginal Peoples’
Participation in Sport (Canadian Heritage, 2005) does not identify any

objectives specific to Aboriginal people. Instead, it offers broad state­
ments about the need for more and more equitable opportunities for
Aboriginal people in sport and outlines four key areas tied to CSP
where development is needed:
• 1‘Enhanced excellence’ focuses on creating a more welcoming
environment for Aboriginal athletes, coaches and officials in
high performance sport;
• 1‘Enhanced participation’ deals with significantly increasing
the number of Aboriginal people at all levels and in all man­
ners of participation;
• 1‘Enhanced capacity’ involves building human resource capac­
ity; and
• 1‘Enhanced interaction’ is about fostering collaboration
between governments, organizations and Aboriginal people
in Aboriginal sport development.
These broad-based statements should not be viewed wholly as a
weakness in the policy. Rather, they are a starting point for deter­
mining measurable objectives that can indicate the success (or not)
of government actions tied to the policy. The guiding principles for
the Aboriginal sport policy aligned with the 2002 CSP, as evidenced
through the listing of the four goals of the 2002 CSP as the framework
for the Aboriginal sport policy. Eventual details were to be worked
out through an action plan for the Aboriginal sport policy, which
would further identify key intentions and associated resources, pro­
viding the foundation for evaluating the effectiveness of the policy.
However, the action plan was never publicly released.
The possibility of sport being used for broader social develop­
ment among Aboriginal people is mentioned in the Aboriginal sport
policy, but was undeveloped in its details. To the contrary, their link­
age to the four goals of the CSP suggests that the Aboriginal sport
policy is only about sport development. Broadening the Aboriginal
sport policy to a federal focus would have allowed other federal
government units, such as Health Canada and Justice, to link
with the policy, connecting and contributing to sport by address­
ing the issues that fit within their mandate but extend beyond
the reach of Sport Canada and Canadian Heritage. Since the pol­
icy did not institutionalize relationships across different federal
units, the possibility that such relationships—which are essential

POLICY ISSUES

to broader social development—would, in fact, be formed were
unlikely.
Aboriginal sport leaders were rightly concerned about the
way in which the objectives for the policy were being construed.
Throughout the policy-making process, we acknowledged that they
had the potential to foster relations between different government
units while countering that it was equally probable the emphasis
on sport could reinforce silos between them. In other words, Health
Canada is not in the business of doing sport, just as Canadian
Heritage does not concern itself with physical health. Our primary
concern was that a departmental policy emphasizing sport would
undermine the broader community and health objectives long hoped
for by Aboriginal sport leaders. On these broader social issues, Sport
Canada states clearly in the Aboriginal sport policy that its role is
limited to sport development: “Sport Canada is committed to con­
tributing, through sport, to the health, wellness, cultural identity and
quality of life of Aboriginal Peoples” (Canadian Heritage, 2005, p. 3,
emphasis in original). We were reminded several times throughout
the process that the policy was intended merely to “open doors” to
other federal departments, not establish formal connections with
them. This approach would thus require each department to con­
struct its own policy in relation to the one that Canadian Heritage
would ultimately endorse. Our concerns were reinforced with the
new CSP, released in June 2012, which clearly states Sport Canada
will “encourage the development of new partnerships (while respecting
government roles and responsibilities) with local and national, domestic
and international, sport and non-sport partners” (Sport Canada, 2012,
p. 22, emphasis added). In other words, Sport Canada will do its best to
encourage relationships between federal departments but will stop
short of building those relationships by breaking down the admin­
istrative boundaries to address matters of broad social importance.
We knew this departmentalized process could take years and (still)
wonder whether it will ever be successful at all.

Current Issues and Limitations
In this final section, we identify and discuss the key issues and
limitations of the Aboriginal sport policy. We begin with an analy­
sis of the outcomes that are ostensibly linked to its implementation,
specifically a CA$ 12M commitment by the federal government to

support programs to increase Aboriginal participation in sport. This
money, provided over five years, from 2005 to 2010, was the most
strategic investment ever made by government to foster Aboriginal
sport development in Canada. With a policy in place, Sport Canada
had a general outline to help guide its decision making about how
to enhance this area of public administration.
How was the CA$ 12M allocated? In view of the fact that the
Aboriginal sport policy was designed to build on the 2002 CSP, the
overarching policy for Canadian sport, funding was given to activi­
ties that would augment that framework. Four areas were targeted
for support: (1) funding for hosting the NAIG in Canada; (2) financial
support for athletes travelling to the NAIG; (3) grants for provincial
and territorial sport development programs and capacity building;
and (4) increased funding for the ASC.
First, up to CA$ 3.5M was provided to assist with hosting
the NAIG, a major sport and cultural festival held approximately
every three years in either Canada or the United States. Following
this cycle would mean that the Games should be hosted in Canada
every six years. However, the NAIG hosting dollars had been made
available in the past. In 2003, two years before the Aboriginal sport
policy was released, the federal and provincial/territorial ministers
responsible for sport, recreation and fitness agreed to support the
hosting component of the NAIG when they are held in Canada, with
the federal and host provincial governments contributing up to 35%
of the Games’ total budget to a maximum of CA$ 3.5M each (Sport
Canada, 2003a): these were the exact same terms that were agreed
to after the policy was released in 2005. Furthermore, in 2004, the
ministers endorsed a multi-party funding agreement for the NAIG,
which included a formal support mechanism for the hosting of the
NAIG when in Canada (Canadian Heritage, 2009c). Bearing this
information in mind, it is debatable whether or not the provision
of NAIG hosting dollars can be seen as an outcome of this policy.
What is certain, and likely more accurate, is that the policy further
institutionalized government support for this area of the NAIG,
ensuring the hosting component would receive a reasonable level
of funding on an ongoing basis thereafter. Practically, it meant that
Canadian host societies would not have to scramble for dollars with
every NAIG, as they had done in the past (Forsyth, 2000), since
permanent funding for this culturally significant event was now
in place.

POLICY ISSUES

A second area targeted for support was athlete travel to the
NAIG. In 2009, the Ministers agreed to provide up to CA$ 1M for
athlete travel to the Games whether in Canada or the United States
(Canadian Intergovernmental Conference Secretariat, 2009). Funding
for this aspect of NAIG was a noteworthy victory. Many Aboriginal
people occupy the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder with
the implication being that involvement in competitive sport is more
a luxury than a normal part of everyday life. Federal support for
travel to and from the NAIG was thus intended to provide athletes,
many of whom otherwise would not have the means to participate
in sport, with an opportunity to experience the Games. This is par­
ticularly true for athletes who live in rural and remote areas, where
the costs associated with sport development often make sport par­
ticipation unaffordable. According to a report compiled by the ASC
(1998), approximately 25% of all Aboriginal people in Canada live in
census metropolitan areas, meaning the vast majority of Aboriginal
people live in smaller towns and cities or in rural or remote areas.
Furthermore, statistics on Aboriginal community population size
and remoteness show that 58% of Aboriginal communities have
populations between 100 and 499 residents. Of those communities,
166 are located between 50 to 350 kilometers from service centres
(which have access to government services, banks, suppliers) and
22 are located more than 350 kilometers from the nearest service
centre (ASC, 1998, p. 12). Much of the Aboriginal population is thus
located far from urban areas where the structure of sport is usually
best supported.
The issue of costs was raised several times in the report on the
regional consultations (Sport Canada, 2003b) for the development
of the Aboriginal sport policy. As noted in the report from Ontario:
Aboriginal people who live in isolated communities must fac­
tor in the cost of an airplane ticket in order to get to a store that
sells equipment. They do not have the luxury of traveling by
car to the nearest supplier to buy the gear they need to play or
compete. These are some of the everyday realities for Aboriginal
people living in small or isolated communities. (Sport Canada,
2003b, p. 11)

Yukon respondents went further in their analysis of the socio­
economic landscape. They linked historical oppression through

residential schools as an issue to contend with in Aboriginal sport
development:
Another interesting point raised around access, is the issue of
competitions that require billeting. This issue was raised as a
challenge for those in the Yukon where travel costs are pro­
hibitive, and some parents/adults are suffering from negative
experiences in residential schools [and thus should not be given
the responsibility of caring for young people]. (Sport Canada,
2003b, p. 26)

And finally, the respondents from the Northwest Territories (NWT)
addressed the cost of sport development from the point of view of
capitalist food production and consumption, asserting, “[The] well­
being of people is closely tied to nutrition, and the cost of trans­
porting food to NWT can result in poor nutrition choices [because
healthier food products are too expensive]” (Sport Canada, 2003b,
p. 23). They were simply stating the obvious—it is difficult for ath­
letes to perform well consistently when they are not getting proper
nourishment.
The above statements revealed the broad range of issues that
Aboriginal people face around sport development, with some con­
cerns, such as the trauma caused by the residential school system,
almost certainly going well beyond the social policy objectives
imagined by Sport Canada officials. We are also alert to the fact
that funding for travel is contingent on the regional teams increas­
ingly needing to meet minimum standards for athlete preparation
and team selection—criteria that are intended to promote elite sport
development by raising the level of competition at the NAIG, an event
where, for the time being at least, the emphasis remains focused on
participation more so than high performance outcomes. As such, we
share Green’s (2004, 2007) skepticism about the rhetoric surrounding
the broader social goals for sport in Canada, wondering where these
goals fit in relation to the high performance priorities that have been
the hallmark of federal efforts over the past 40 years. For now, the
extent to which these broader concerns can be addressed through
the Aboriginal sport policy remains to be seen.
The Federal-Provincial/Territorial Bilateral Agreements for Sport
Development was the third area targeted for support.7 Similar to
the hosting dollars for the NAIG, the bilateral agreements for sport

POLICY ISSUES

development were in place several years before the Aboriginal
sport policy was released in 2005. In 2002, Sport Canada recognized
participation in sport, recreation and physical activity as a program
priority and created the bilateral agreements as one of four initiatives
to address the lower rates of representation in sport among girls and
young women, persons with a disability, visible minorities, youth at
risk, the economically disadvantaged, and Aboriginal people. As a
result, the federal, provincial and territorial governments directed
human and financial resources towards increasing participation
among these historically underrepresented groups. The bilateral
agreements for sport development thus represent a joint response
by the two levels of government—the federal government, through
Sport Canada, and the provincial/territorial governments—to pri­
orities outlined in the 2002 CSP and the Federal-Provincial/Territorial
Priorities for Collaborative Action, 2002–2005 (Sport Canada, 2002b).
In terms of funding allocation, the federal government provided
CA$ 4M over three years, from 2003–2006, to be shared among the
provinces and territories, with equivalent matching funds to be
provided by those governments. Of those funds, approximately
CA$ 1M were distributed between the 13 provincial and territorial
governments of Canada for Aboriginal sport development. Thus,
each of the 13 governments had approximately CA$ 77,000 to put
towards programs for Aboriginal people. In terms of costs for travel
in rural and remote areas, which is needed for enhanced training
and competition, this money would hardly make a dent in terms of
sport development.
Not all of the CA$ 1M was designated for programming. A por­
tion of it went to capacity building for the PTASBs, the regional affili­
ates of the ASC. While the ASC focuses on national level activities
(e.g., national championships, national policy issues), the PTASBs
are responsible for programming and policy development in their
region and are thus the primary means for advancing Aboriginal
sport throughout the country. Even with this limited funding, there
remains uneven government support for PTASB capacity. Since the
ASC was first established in 1995, it has repeatedly identified PTASB
support as a cornerstone to Aboriginal sport development. In 1998, of
the 13 regions represented at the ASC, only six had operational bod­
ies with two additional bodies being formed. Of the six operational
bodies, only three received core operating funds from their provincial
governments and one had partial program support (ASC, 1998, p. 10).

The Double Helix

More than a decade later, in 2009, while each region has a represen­
tative body, several affiliates still do not have a consistent funding
base, a limitation that has had a significant bearing on their ability to
influence sport development in their region. Among other things, it
means the PTASBs cannot hire personnel for programming, let alone
deal with the intricacies of policy development. With little or no staff,
some areas such as Quebec and most of the Maritimes have operated
almost wholly on volunteer help from Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal
people highly dedicated to Aboriginal sport. Predictably, this results
in uneven development throughout the country, as some regions are
more able than others to create and sustain initiatives.
The bilateral funding is reminiscent of the Native Sport and
Recreation Program in the 1970s (discussed in the Background sec­
tion) in that it has led to the creation of a number of Aboriginal sport
participation initiatives throughout the country. For example, in
Alberta in the 2004–2005 fiscal year, 40 trained youth workers ran
36 sport camps, with 14,589 Aboriginal youth participating (Treasury
Board of Canada, 2005). There is, however, a conspicuous differ­
ence between the two programs. In the 1970s, Native sport leaders
were provided with decision-making authority about the types of
programs that should be developed and how they should be imple­
mented. In the current bilateral agreements, however, the regional
governments—not the PTASBs—are given programming autonomy,
and very few provincial and territorial governments consult with
the regional Aboriginal sport bodies about program development
and implementation.
In so doing, the bilateral agreements reinforce historically
oppressive relations between Aboriginal people and government. To
be sure, the PTASBs and the ASC consider this process unacceptable
and have registered their displeasure at the highest level of govern­
ment, as indicated by the following comment from Lyle Daniels,
Chair of the ASC, in addressing the 2005 Ministers’ Conference in
Regina, Saskatchewan:
We have advocated for years about all of the very practical
things we would like to do to support community-based pro­
gramming, and to some extent we have accepted the reality that
funds are limited. As we have examined the bilateral process
and compared notes among our Provincial/Territorial Aboriginal
Sport Bodies, the discrepancies have become apparent. While I

POLICY ISSUES

want to commend those governments that have made Aboriginal
sport development a major priority within the bilateral agree­
ments, it is clear that others have chosen a very different focus.
(Daniels, 2005)

His remark about some governments having chosen “a very differ­
ent route” than was hoped for by the PTASBs is a sharp reminder
that the Government of Canada is still resistant to the notion of the
model of the double helix. In some regions, funding went to wellestablished mainstream sport and recreation organizations rather
than to Aboriginal community groups or to the PTASB, the principal
agent for developing and delivering Aboriginal programming in the
Aboriginal sport system. So while this funding further reinforces the
mainstream sport system and its involvement in Aboriginal sport, it
does not help to stabilize and support the Aboriginal sport system’s
delivery system.
Lastly, the bilateral funding provided the ASC with CA$ 535,000
per year for three years beginning in 2003. Organizational support
is critical but it is only provided at the national level, a top-heavy
approach that further widens the asymmetry between the Aboriginal
and mainstream sport system. A second round of bilateral funding
was made available for the ASC for another three years beginning
in 2006. Until the provinces and territories commit serious dollars
for administration and staffing of the PTASBs, the ASC as a collec­
tive will continue to struggle to address barriers at the community
level. While the PTASBs are contributing to the development of elite
athletes through initiatives such as the NAIG and coaching and
athlete development camps, community development remains an
area that has fallen very short. The ministers, along with relevant
federal departments need to address this gap by training community
leaders and developing sustainable grassroots programs. This issue
is exemplified by the lack of attention paid to the highly anticipated
report, Best Practices—Physical Activity Programs for Aboriginal Youth
(The Sutcliffe Group Inc. and Sluth Management Consulting, 2007)—a
compilation of information generated from data collected by people
working in Aboriginal sport and recreation development throughout
the country. The insights provided in this document could be enhanc­
ing community capacity for Aboriginal sport but the government
has shelved it: the federal-provincial/territorial ministers responsible
for sport, recreation and fitness abandoned the report shortly after

The Double Helix

it was concluded. Why? We argue that the data collected through
this report, which shows a real need and interest in sport as a tool
for broader social development (not simply elite participation), runs
counter to the institutionalized and naturalized views of ‘sport’ held
by federal officials, so that ‘best practices’ at the Aboriginal commu­
nity level are definitely not the same ‘best practices’ imagined by the
power bloc in government.
In terms of key weaknesses not being addressed, there is only
one—but it is significant: there remains no action plan for Sport
Canada’s Policy on Aboriginal Peoples’ Participation in Sport (Canadian
Heritage, 2005), even though it states that an action plan will be
developed (p. 8). Without an action plan, transparency and account­
ability tied to the policy becomes impossible to achieve. Action
plans have been released for subsequent Sport Canada policies cre­
ated to enhance access and equity for other historically marginal­
ized groups in sport. The Policy on Sport for Persons with a Disability
(Canadian Heritage, 2006) has an action plan with clear resource
commitments, as does Actively Engaged: A Policy on Sport for Women
and Girls (Canadian Heritage, 2009a) (see Chapters X and XI for more
details). The same needs to be done—and has been promised in the
policy—for Aboriginal people and sport.
Why no action plan? We believe that this omission is tied to
challenges embedded in the development of the Aboriginal sport
policy. The Reference Group, comprised of selected members from the
Aboriginal Sport Circle and government involved in the development
of the Aboriginal sport policy, stated their belief that most provincial
and territorial governments felt that Aboriginal sport and recreation
could be addressed through a generic policy that encompassed all
citizens; that is, the CSP (Sport Canada, 2003c, pp. 4–5). The absence
of an action plan reinforces this approach, assuming that the provin­
cial and territorial governments can (and should) adequately address
the needs and interests of Aboriginal people in sport. No action plan
also means no clear measures for evaluation. What is more, the 2012
CSP does not offer any indication that an action plan for Aboriginal
sport will be developed. Indeed, Section 7, “Policy Implementation
and Action Plans,” suggests the government’s preferred course of
action will be the status quo:
Consistent with the first CSP, this approach to implementation
will respect the existing roles and responsibilities of the federal and

provincial/territorial governments that are described in the
National Recreation Statement (1987) and other existing gov­
ernmental agreements addressing specific jurisdictional realities.
The renewed policy direction is supported by governments and
non-governments to the extent of their desired commitment.
(Sport Canada, 2012, p. 15, emphasis added)

In this kind of policy environment, how can Sport Canada and the
ASC really assess what they have accomplished as a result of the CSP
or the Aboriginal sport policy to determine where the gaps are and
how best to move forward?

Conclusion
Policy, by its nature, sets boundaries for how activities within
its purview are structured. Our examination of the creation and
implementation of the Aboriginal sport policy highlights several
strengths arising from this policy, tied to further issues that need to
be addressed. Sport Canada has become a leader worldwide through
its formal recognition and legitimation of government support for
Aboriginal sport, including the Aboriginal sport system. The policy
pays some attention to the particular, holistic approach taken by
Aboriginal people to sport, broadly understood. Likewise, the pos­
sibilities for social development through sport are noted. And finan­
cial resources have been directed to Aboriginal organizations and
athletes. All these elements hold promise for enhancing the access
and equity of Aboriginal people in sport, and for their contribution,
therefore, to a values-based approach to sport in Canada.
However, the promised action plan has not emerged, which
could have clarified objectives tied to these strengths, generat­
ing a uniquely Aboriginal vision of sport participation. How can
Aboriginal organizers demonstrate, and thus further legitimate their
preferred approach towards sport participation, and/or revise it as
necessary, when there is no formal set of objectives and accompa­
nying evaluation plan in place? Without this action plan, resources
are instead being directed to provincial and territorial govern­
ments rather than to PTASBs, reinforcing the mainstream portion
of the double helix instead of those organizations that facilitate the
operation of the Aboriginal sport system. This pattern of resource
distribution does not allow for the further legitimizing of the

Aboriginal sport system; instead, its legitimacy is undercut along
with its perceived suitability for government resources. Funding to
NAIG and to the ASC reinforce a focus on elite sport more so than
the community-based development necessary for social goals to be
reached. And the departmental focus of the Aboriginal sport policy
lends itself to an emphasis on sport development, rather than social
development through sport. Creating structural links between federal
departments is one way that Aboriginal aspirations linking sport
and social development can be pursued more concretely. Generating
an action plan with Aboriginal people that gets resources into the
communities and generates capacity within Aboriginal sport bod­
ies, thus enhancing Aboriginal self-determination is a second way
that sport development can combine with social development. This
process would ensure that Aboriginal people are involved in their
own visioning and provision of sport, broadly understood and
holistically framed.
The evaluation that follows from that action plan would help
assess their success in that endeavour. It would also serve as a valuesbased approach that the mainstream sport system could draw upon
as it works to enhance access and equity across Canada. This outcome
is the strength of the double helix model of Aboriginal sport—both
Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people have much to learn as we
share our separate and intertwined approaches towards the provi­
sion of sport in a manner that enhances the lives of all Canadians.
However, the Aboriginal sport system must be further legitimized
before its many contributions to the mainstream sport system can
be seen and adopted. Once these steps are taken, we will be closer to
developing novel ways in which disadvantaged groups in Canada can
receive enhanced access and equity in the Canadian sport system,
which is surely the goal of a truly values-based sport system.

3. In response to a question about the usefulness of the double helix as
a model for discussing Aboriginal sport in Canada, one interviewee
in Braden Te Hiwi’s (2009) thesis noted her preference for the image of
two canoes in the two-row wampum as a way for moving indigenous
peoples and the government forward, rather than the more “heavily
scientific grounding” of the double helix (p. 130). The Mohawk concept
of the two-row wampum belt is a model of how people should govern
themselves in Mohawk society, as well as how Mohawks see themselves
relating to other groups around them.

rights. Aboriginal rights are not clearly defined, and must be estab­

With respect to the Nisga’a in British Columbia, as a modern treaty,
the Nisga’a Treaty describes in detail how the rights of Nisga’a citizens
will be exercised. Any Aboriginal rights of the Nisga’a are modified to
become rights set out in the Treaty. In this way, the negotiating parties
have agreed to rights—rather than extinguishing them. Retrieved from
