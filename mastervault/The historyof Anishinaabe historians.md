In my first years of college, I took a class that focused on the intellectual 
heritage of the Western world. And as I read those works, I started wondering, 
what history is there of indigenous intellectuals in North America? I was 
excited to discover that there is actually a fairly long history of Metis and 
Anishinaabe writers, especially historians.
 
Probably the most famous Ojibwe historian of the 19th century is William Whipple
Warren. The son of an American trader and a mixed-blood Ojibwe woman (the 
daughter of Michel and Madeline Cadotte, two high profile local figures), he was
born at LaPointe in modern Wisconsin and was educated in several schools out 
east intended for Native American pupils. He is most well-known for his work 
History of the Ojibway People, written in the 1840s and published in 1885 after 
his death, in which he synthesized Anishinaabe oral tradition with Western 
historiographical tradition. Modern Blackfoot/Ojibwe historian Theresa Schenck 
has edited a version of this work which is a really fascinating look at the 
Dakota-Ojibwe conflicts of the 1700s and 1800s.
 
Another major figure is Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, the child of an Irish fur 
trader and an Ojibwe chief’s daughter, who lived from 1800 to 1842. A prominent 
figure in Sault Ste. Marie, she wrote poetry in both English and Ojibwe along 
with traditional stories learned from her mother, some of which was published in
a local literary magazine. Her work is particularly important to American 
literature as a whole because the stories from her mother became the basis for 
Longfellow’s poem “Hiawatha,” Lonfellow having learned them from Jane’s American
husband Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. Henry, an early figure in American anthropology,
published a number of his wife’s stories in altered form, and she went largely 
unknown for years. An excellent book about her life and writings is available, 
titled The Sound the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky. More information and 
some of her writings are available on the book’s website[1].
 
A number of early Anishinaabe writers were Christians and missionaries. Peter 
Jones was a Mississauga Methodist preacher in the early 19th century who devoted
his life to spreading the word of Christianity to other indigenous people. On 
top of his extensive traveling to give speeches advocating assimilation, Jones 
worked on translating the Bible and numerous prayers into Ojibwe, and wrote a 
history of the Ojibwe people. George Copway, another Mississauga, converted to 
Methodism along with his parents at an early age and served as a missionary 
until being defrocked for embezzlement. He was briefly a celebrity among the 
East Coast elite for his autobiography and history of the Ojibwe people 
published in 1850.
 
Although he was Odawa rather than Ojibwe, another significant Anishinaabe writer
was Andrew Blackbird. He attended school for several years, including a stint at
Eastern Michigan University, and served as a translator and mediator between 
local Odawa and Ojibwe people and the US government. In 1887 he published a 
history of the Odawa and Ojibwe in Michigan[2] as well as a grammar of the 
languages. Another non-Ojibwe Anishinaabe writer was Simon Pokagon, a Potawatomi
activist who became quite popular among Chicago elites in the late 1800s. His 
work included criticisms of the US treatment of Native people along with 
historical accounts of local history. You can read his “Red Man’s Rebuke[3]” 
online, which he distributed at the 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition.
 
Those are just a few of the historical writers that I know of. Anishinaabe 
people were some of the earliest Native people to produce English works, likely 
because of their longtime contact with fur traders and officials. They were 
significant for producing indigenous perspectives on history early on. Modern 
Anishinaabe writers such as Anton Treuer, Patty Loew, Erik M. Redix, and Theresa
Schenck (among many others) are today continuing to push the boundaries of 
indigenous history by challenging the biases and methods of historiography and 
choosing to indigenize them in various ways. In doing so, they are drawing on a 
long tradition of Anishinaabe historians that came before them.
