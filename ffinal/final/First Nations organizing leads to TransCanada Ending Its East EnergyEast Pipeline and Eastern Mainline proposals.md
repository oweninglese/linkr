[[First]] [[Nations]] organizing leads to Trans[[Canada]] Ending Its East Energy East 
Pipeline and [[Eastern]] Mainline proposals.
[[Indigenous]] Climate Action and [[Indigenous]] Environmental Network respond to this 
decision and its impact on [[First]] [[Nations]] and [[Indigenous]] Peoples. 
 
Edmonton, AB – Today, Trans[[Canada]] has informed the [[Canadian]] National Energy 
Board that it will end its application for the contested Energy East pipeline 
and [[Eastern]] Mainline proposals. 
 
The [[Calgary]]-based energy company was seeking approval of what was to be the 
longest tar sands oil pipeline in [[Canada]], with a proposed carrying capacity of 
1.1 million barrels of oil per day. Resistance to the pipeline project was lead 
by [[Indigenous]] peoples and [[First]] [[Nations]] from the Tar Sands region in [[Northern]] 
Alberta to Wolastoq territory in [[New]]s [[Brunswick]]. 
 
The following statement is from Eriel Deranger, Executive Director of the 
[[Indigenous]] Climate Action: 
 
“As someone from the Tar Sands territory, I want to thank everyone who stepped 
up, stepped in and worked so hard to pave the way for the [[Indigenous]] Rights and 
[[climate]] justice narrative to permeate the discourse and debate on Energy East. 
My own community continues to experience the direct environmental, physical, 
spiritual and long term legacy of the industry. The Kinder Morgan TransMountain 
pipeline, and the KXL pipeline still loom overhead. The largest proposed Tar 
Sands Mine, Teck Frontier Mine, is awaiting approval in Alberta. We must 
celebrate this moment, but continue to collectively work together to challenge 
the systems that uphold these projects and ensure they are not duplicated as we 
develop a true just transition future, one that includes the recognition and 
valuation of human, environmental and rights of [[Indigenous]] peoples. ”
 
The following statement is from Wolastoq Grand Chief, Spasaqsit Possesom (Ron 
Tremblay), [[New]] [[Brunswick]]:
 
“As Wolastoq Grand Chief, this is exceptional news for Wolastoqey Nation. Our 
Wolastoq Homeland begins at the shores of the St. Lawrence seaway in what is 
known today as [[Quebec]], through North-[[Western]] Maine and all the way down through 
the western part of [[New]] [[Brunswick]] to the Bay of Fundy where our river Wolastoq 
(St. John river) empties into the [[Atlantic]] Ocean.
 
Energy East Project was a major concern for the safety of our waterways, fish, 
vegetation, animals plus our people who reside next to the Wolastoq (St. John 
river).
 
Please recognize this is a partial victory. We can celebrate our success here in
the east coast although we need not overlook our [[Indigenous]] Sisters and Brothers
in the west coast who must deal with the Kinder Morgan Pipeline that was 
authorized by the [[[[Trudeau]]]] [[government]]. Here in Wolastoq Homeland, we will 
continue to support the western [[Indigenous]] [[Nations]] as they resist the Kinder 
Morgan Pipeline.”
 
The following statement is from Katsi’tsakwas Ellen Gabriel, Kanien’kehá:ka of 
Kanehsatà:ke, Land Defender and Human Rights Activist:
 
“This is a victory owed to all [[Indigenous]] peoples and civil society groups 
dedicated to a healthy and prosperous environment for present and future 
generations.
 
This should be seen not solely as a victory, but an opportunity to rethink 
capitalism and how sustainable energy is not only more economical, but creates a
more promising legacy for present and future generations; a future in which it 
is clear that our human rights are interrelated and intertwined with the rights 
of Mother Earth and all our relations.”
 
The following statement is from Dallas Goldtooth, Keep It In The Ground 
Organizer of the [[Indigenous]] Environmental Network: 
 
“This as a tremendous [[battle]] victory in the greater fight to keep fossil fuels 
in the ground and for [[climate]] justice for [[Indigenous]] nations. Today’s 
announcement supports the validity and strength of an [[Indigenous]] rights-based 
approach to win these [[battle]]s. All along the Energy East pipeline route [[First]] 
[[Nations]] took a stand to defend their inherent rights, protect their water and 
Mother Earth and resist the colonial actions of [[Canada]] and its oil regime. This 
fight against Trans[[Canada]] has always been about more than just a pipeline, it is
also about deconstructing [[colonialism]] and building a better, more sustainable, 
and just society for the benefit of all living beings and future generations. As
such, we fight on!”
