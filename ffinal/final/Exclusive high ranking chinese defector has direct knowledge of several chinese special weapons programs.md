# EXCLUSIVE: High-Ranking Chinese Defector Has 'Direct Knowledge' of Several Chinese Special Weapons Programs – RedState

> ## Excerpt
> Knowledge of the defector was kept from FBI, Langley due to potential compromise of those agencies.

A person believed to be among the highest-ranking [[defector]]s ever to the [[United]] [[States]] from the People’s Republic of [[China]] has been working with the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for months, sources inside the intelligence community have told RedState on condition of anonymity. The [[defector]] has direct knowledge of special weapons programs in [[China]], including [[bioweapon]]s programs, those sources say.

The information provided to RedState corroborates and clarifies Thursday evening’s reporting by journalist Adam Housley.

> Being told the increased pressure on [[China]] in recent days is due to a [[defector]] with intimate knowledge. In fact, Wray didn’t know right away because they wanted to make sure they got all they needed before telling him.

RedState’s sources say that’s partially true. [[FBI]] Director Christopher Wray was “ambushed” with the information, they say, and Langley was also unaware. Sources say DIA leadership kept the [[defector]] within their Clandestine Services network to prevent Langley and the State Department from accessing the person, whose existence was kept from other agencies because DIA leadership believes there are [[Chinese]] spies or sources inside the [[FBI]], [[CIA]], and several other federal agencies.

> Also…US intelligence believes [[China]] is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that it originally came from a lab. The belief is still that it escaped accidentally, but was allowed to spread.

> Again…what I reported tonight. US intelligence has a [[Chinese]] [[defector]] with [[Wuhan]] info. AND [[China]] is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that [[corona[[virus]]]] originally came from a lab

More information will be published as it becomes available to RedState.

_UPDATE 12:30 PM PDT, [[June]] 4, 2021_

Sources tell RedState the [[defector]] has been with the DIA for three months and that he has provided an extensive, technically detailed debrief to US officials. In DIA’s assessment, the information provided by the [[defector]] is legitimate. Sources say the level of confidence in the [[defector]]’s information is what has led to a sudden crisis of confidence in Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]], adding that [U.S. Army Medical [[Research]] Institute of Infectious [[Disease]]s ([[USA]]MRIID)](https://www.usamriid.army.mil/) personnel detailed to DIA have corroborated very technical details of information provided by the [[defector]].

_(NOTE: Several former [[CIA]] officers have questioned the veracity of this story or termed it an outright fabrication. We are aware of those comments and stand by our sources.)_
