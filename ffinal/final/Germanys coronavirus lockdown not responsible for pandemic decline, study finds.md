# Germany's coronavirus lockdown 'not responsible' for pandemic decline, study finds | Fox News

> ## Excerpt
> A new study from a German university found that the country’s COVID-19 infections were already falling prior to each government-mandated lockdown.

A new [study](https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research) from a [German](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/germany) [university](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/education) found that the country’s [[[COVID]]-19](https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/infectious-disease/[[corona[[virus]]]]) infections were already falling prior to each [[government]]-mandated [[lockdown]]. 

Statisticians at the Ludwig Maximilians [[University]] of Munich analyzed the infection rates around the time of national [[lockdown]]s in Germany. 

The study concluded that the rate of infection was already declining when the [[government]] mandated more extreme measures in an effort to combat the spread of the [[virus]].

The study focused on the number of people each infected person infected with the [[virus]], which statisticians argue is harder to distort with [[flu]]ctuating test rates, [according to the Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/06/03/german-study-finds-[[lockdown]]-had-little-effect-[[virus]]-infections/). 

Each time a [[lockdown]] was initiated, the data already indicated a decline in infections. 

This has led some anti-[[lockdown]] supporters to claim that the [[lockdown]]s had "no effect" on stopping the [[pandemic]] spread, but the study’s authors have stressed that it is not clear what effect the [[lockdown]]s might have otherwise had.

"The measures taken could have had a positive effect on the course of the infection, but are not solely responsible for the decline," the study’s authors wrote.

Professor Ralph Brinks argued that "you can’t tell" if a [[lockdown]] was necessary. 

"All that it shows is that the start of the [[lockdown]] and the fall in infections do not coincide," Brinks said during an interview on German television.

No one has disputed the study’s figures, but some scientists argued that the mere discussion and debate about [[lockdown]]s may have in[[flu]]enced people’s behavior. 

Germany initiated a "[[lockdown]] lite" with only bars and restaurants closed in [[November]], moving to more complete [[lockdown]]s in [[December]] and again in [[April]]. 

Medical journalist Christoph Specht claimed on [public radio Deutschlandfunk](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/medizinjournalist-zu-corona-massnahmen-wir-verwenden-den.694.de.html?dram:article_id=496228) that the number of infections fell because of vaccinations rather than the "emergency brake" [[lockdown]] [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Angela Merkel’s administration initiated.

"Yes, I think so - not necessarily because of the emergency brake, but because more [[vaccine]] is not only popular, but has actually been delivered in the last few days," Specht said.
