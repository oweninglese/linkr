annual Decolonizing Thanksgiving Dinner in Guelph, [[Ontario]] on traditional 
Neutral/Chonnonton, Anishinabec, and Haudenosaunee territory. This text is also

The image above is of a Métis home built in a road allowance in Saskatchewan at 
the beginning of the 20th century. Excluded from any legal form of existing on 
land following the Red River Rebellion, the experience of the Métis shows how 
far the [[Canadian]] state is willing to go in crushing and dispossessing those it 
can’t “reconcile.
 
Zhaawanong Noodin Ikwe ndishnikaaz. Michif-Nêhiyaw endow. Gaawiin

My name is ******. My [[Indian]] name is [[Southern]] Wind Woman. I am Michif-[[Cree]]. I do
not know my clan. I am from Saskatchewan (Meadow Lake, specifically) and I now 
live in Dish with One Spoon Territory in Hamilton now. I announce my name in 
Anishinaabemowin because I received it in an [[Ojibwe]] Sundance lodge, a community 
here in these territories I have been accepted into. I have mixed French, 
[[Scottish]] and Swedish heritage. Furthermore, I identify as Queer/Two Spirit 
interchangeably (she/her), I’m an organizer, a proud feminist, and an anarchist.
 
Over the years I’ve been intimately involved in a wide range of movements, from 
animal liberation to land defense struggles, issues of [[Indigenous]] [[sovereignty]], 
the fight against patriarchy, and push back against gentrification. I see all 
these struggles as connected.
 
I want to take a second to reflect on knowledge and the creation of it in our 
communities. What you will hear me speak on tonight is a work in progress and, 
you can be sure, that six months from now I’ll probably have different feelings 
and new thoughts about it. Ideas aren’t static. It is also important to 
acknowledge that our individual realities limit our ability to comprehend the 
diverse networks of knowledge that inform other people’s lives. Tonight, I am up
here speaking and what I say will be attributed to me. What is lost is the 
hundreds of hours of support, reflection, and political debate that other 
comrades and friends have engaged in with me.
 
Knowledge is not created by individuals, but by communities.
 
Because I believe these things, I’ve decided that this will be my last speaking 
event of the year. I’ve been honoured with a lot of opportunities to share my 
opinion lately, but it is now my time to sit, listen, and reflect. And there is 
no better time to practice that humility than winter.
 
I’d just like to preface this by saying that some of the things I’m going to say
tonight are going to be challenging, maybe even upsetting, for some people. If 
it is, I apologize. But I was also offered [[tobacco]] to speak tonight and so I 
have to speak my truth.
 
I was asked to come and speak to you tonight about reconciliation.
I think it is important for me to begin this talk by telling you that I have no 
interest in reconciliation (at this time) and that I think the concept is a 
state-led smoke screen used to advance a more sophisticated policy of 
assimilation. I want to talk a little bit about reconciliation, decolonization, 
the difference between the two, and the role of the state in all of this.
 
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed in [[2007]] after residential 
school survivors won the largest class-action lawsuit in [[Canadian]] [[history]]. They 
modelled it after the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 
South [[Africa]], which was fitting, seeing as how South [[Africa]] looked to the 
[[Canadian]] reservation infrastructure for inspiration in setting up their own 
racist and segregated system.
 
As most of us know, the TRC concluded with 94 actionable measures that the 
[[government]], educational institutions, and individuals could take to pursue 
reconciliation between settler and [[Indigenous]] communities. Universities started 
implementing new educational curriculum about colonization. [[[[Trudeau]]]] started 
wearing shorter sleeves so we could all see his Haida raven tattoo. Land 
acknowledgements began popping up everywhere. The [[government]] of [[Canada]] recently 
released their 10 Points of Official Reconciliation, which is a document that I 
will refer back to during my talk.
 
I’m honoured to sit here tonight and tell you that reconciliation – as we know 
it – is an impossible lie.
 
Official [[Canadian]] reconciliation centers on accepting the past, apologizing, and
moving forward together. It doesn’t necessitate physical [[reparations]] for the 
[[history]] of colonization. In fact, it discourages that sort of rhetoric as 
divisive. Counterproductive. Difficult.
 
There exists a fundamental problem here, because settler-[[colonialism]] doesn’t 
exist in the past. Its [[violence]] is pervasive and ongoing, right now, tonight, 
everywhere we look. Reconciliation is the erasure of this current 
settler-colonial [[violence]].
 
Reconciliation – as a term – is about resolving a conflict, returning to a state
of friendly relations. It can also mean the bringing together of two positions 
so as to make them compatible.
 
Decolonization – on the other hand – is about repealing the authority of the 
colonial state and redistributing land and resources. It also means embracing 
and legitimizing previously repressed [[Indigenous]] worldviews.
 
Decolonization isn’t a light word. We have to think about what colonization is 
to understand it: the complete administrative and economic domination of a 
people and place. Repealing that is a big deal.
 
Nevertheless, you will often see these two words thrown around almost 
interchangeably, especially in the university context where folks using them 
aren’t actually actors in struggle. I would argue that this is inappropriate.
 
The occupying and dominating force in our context is the state of [[Canada]].
I don’t see the creation of the [[Canadian]] state as coinciding with the signing of
the [[British]] North America Act in [[1867]], but as a slow process of 
institution-building that began at first settlement. Confederation was just the 
official recognition of that process.
 
The state – we use this word a lot, but we aren’t always using it with an 
understanding of what it is. Tonight when I use the term, I mean a state is a 
compulsory political organization with a centralized [[government]] that maintains a
monopoly on the legitimate use of force within a specific territory, mapped out 
within the confines of borders. This is what [[Canada]] is. Secondary are the public
declarations of love for poutine and jokes about affinity for beavers.
 
Zoos are colonial institutions as well. And they used to hold humans. True fact,
you can look it up. A lot of [[Indigenous]] humans, and [[Africa]]ns. Trying to shed the
baggage of that racist past, they later rebranded themselves as educational and 
conservation organizations. But a zoo will always be a zoo.
 
[[Canada]] was created in order to govern, exploit, and expand the territories 
swindled, settled, and stolen from [[Indigenous]] peoples of this land. That wasn’t 
a by-product, it was its primary function. It still is. It always will be. It 
can’t escape that.
 
So how can the [[Canadian]] state reconcile with [[Indigenous]] peoples?They certainly 
can’t “go back” to a state of friendly relations because there never existed 
such a time. Reconciliation can only mean eliminating the conflict by enmeshing 
[[Indigenous]] and settler communities, which is the second version of that 
definition that I shared, making conflicting positions compatible.
 
This means assimilating [[Indigenous]] peoples by having them give up their claim to
[[sovereignty]] in exchange for the promise of the economic equality within [[Canada]]. 
And it means [[Canadian]] people get to devour [[Indigenous]] ideas and symbols into 
their own settler stories, their own canadiana. This is the only path possible 
under the [[Canadian]] state.
 
The return of land and the power to govern said lands could never be possible 
under this structure. The resource-based frameworks that define land and water 
under the logic of Capitalism could never be reconciled with giving away so much
money to [[Indigenous]] communities. The state-based frameworks that define 
territory under the nation-state system could never be reconciled with giving 
away so much power. It just couldn’t happen.
 
I don’t want to sit up here tonight and lecture you, I want you to be 
politically engaged with these ideas and thinking about your own politics. 
Realistically, what I’m offering you is a challenge to your own frameworks of 
justice and “good enough”.
 
I posit that you have to decide which of these ideas you are pursuing 
politically?
Are you interested in reconciliation or are you fighting for decolonization?
The words aren’t interchangeable. We have to stop using them that way.
 
I also don’t see the two ideas as compatible or complimentary. They aren’t part 
of some mythical umbrella of Left progressivism. One is calling for the 
continuation of the [[Canadian]] state and the other for its abolition.
 
This goes beyond simply saying that you are fighting for decolonization. Your 
politics matter. If you believe in [[Canadian]] democracy, if you believe the system
works but is just broken, if you believe that voting in another electoral party 
candidate could truly make a difference, then you aren’t interested in 
decolonization.
 
Decolonization doesn’t just mean anti-capitalist, it means anti-state.
The first of these opinions is relatively uncontroversial and accepted in our 
activist circles, it’s the second that usually gets people.
 
To those who feel as though what I’m saying is too binary, that there is still 
good to be done under the system of a [[Canadian]] state, I offer you the logic of 
[[Canada]]’s 10 Points of Official Reconciliation and ask you to ponder the question
of “rights”.
Let’s look together at some of these points.
 
1) [[Canada]] recognizes [[Indigenous]] rights to self-determination.
 
2) [[Canada]] sees reconciliation as fundamental to Section 35 of the
Constitution Act.
 
3) [[Canada]] recognizes it needs to act with integrity.
 
4) [[Canada]] sees [[Indigenous]] self-[[government]] as part of
the federalism of the provinces
 
5) [[Canada]] says it needs to uphold the [[treaties]].
 
(Six and seven I’ll come back to.)
 
8) [[Canada]] desires to construct a new fiscal relationship.
 
9) [[Canada]] recognizes that reconciliation is flexible.
 
10) [[Canada]] recognizes that [[Indigenous]] peoples are all different.
 
I chose not to read out the expanded points of this list because I think it is a
generally useless and boring document. A perfect example of the bureaucratic 
s[[kill]] of using an abundance of words to say absolutely nothing. But I would 
encourage you to peruse it on your own, if you feel so inclined.
 
Pay particular attention to the careful phrasing to describe where [[Indigenous]] 
people fit into the imagination of this post-reconciliation utopia. For all the 
fancy wording, there is no promise of [[sovereignty]], only money that will bring 
[[Indigenous]] people up to the standard of living of [[Canadian]]s, so that they are 
readily available and willing to be absorbed into the project of [[Canada]].
 
I give you a quote from point 2 to illustrate this:
 
“Reconciliation is an ongoing process through which [[Indigenous]] peoples and the 
[[Crown]] work cooperatively to establish and maintain a mutually respectful 
framework for living together, with a view to [[foster]]ing strong, healthy, and 
sustainable [[Indigenous]] nations within a strong [[Canada]].”
 
There are different incarnations of this subtle assertion of [[Canadian]] supremacy 
in points 2, 3, 4, 8, & 10. Now let’s go back to points 6 & 7, arguably the most
important in this document.
 
Point 6 talks about securing the free, prior, and informed consent of [[Indigenous]]
peoples in regards to their land when [[Canada]] wants to take it, develop it, or 
exploit it. This wordy section is full of phrases like consensus and consent, 
collaboration and consultation: it actually has all of those in one little 
section.
 
Point 7 – a much shorter section – immediately revokes that false commitment. It
says that, consultation is an aspiration, but that the control of land 
supposedly held by [[Indigenous]] peoples can be overridden in any situation 
beneficial to the state of [[Canada]].
 
[[Indigenous]] peoples, even under the banner of reconciliation, do not have the 
right to say no to the state of [[Canada]]. The right to say no is critical to the 
realization of [[sovereignty]], of consent, of freedom.
 
But it should come as no surprise to [[Canadian]]s who are paying attention. States 
operate on the illusion of rights. The [[government]] has the right to seize your 
[[property]] too. It can expropriate any piece of land that it needs to serve its 
goals of economic expansion, whether that be for a dam or an airport or a 
highway or a pipeline.
 
This is because rights “given” to you by the [[government]] can be taken away by the
[[government]]. These rights aren’t real. This is fake freedom.
 
It is my belief that there can be no reconciliation that recognizes the 
self-determination of [[Indigenous]] peoples so long as the state of [[Canada]] exists. 
Once embraced, this conclusion leads you towards a radical and [[revolution]]ary 
politic in search of answers. Though I I will admit I remain skeptical as an 
anarchist, I spent a good deal of time listening and trying to envision what 
Communist comrades meant when they spoke of [[revolution]].
 
I asked them where [[Indigenous]] nations fit into their hope for a 
proletariat-dictated state. I asked them how this new world would make space for
[[Indigenous]] worldviews or land-based spiritualities. I asked them how they 
intended to share power and return land.
 
Time and time again I was convinced – through their insufficient or nonexistent 
answers to those questions – that their proletariat-dictated state would be no 
better for the people or the earth than the liberal-capitalist one we have now.
 
Many times they would tell me that the return of land was paramount to upholding
the justice of the new communist state, but their mechanisms for handing back 
that land were [[missing]]. In this new state, where land was to be publicly seized 
and redistributed among working class settlers, where was the room to 
authoritatively give away huge sections of it to sovereign entities without 
sparking massive settler-entitlement-provoked unrest?
 
Many times they countered that argument by saying there was more than enough 
[[Crown]] Land to give back to [[Indigenous]] nations that they wouldn’t have to give 
away cityscapes or farmland, but they fail to realize that much of that [[Crown]] 
Land is the site of massive resource wealth. An industrial communist state – 
which we could almost definitely expect – would need to produce prosperity to 
ensure a counter[[revolution]] didn’t quickly overtake its new central authority. 
Wouldn’t it then need resources in order to keep the people happy and also to 
fuel the grand people’s military?
 
These are all huge problems, and the picture they paint doesn’t make me very 
enthusiastic for the coming red [[revolution]], but most importantly, they don’t 
begin to address the fundamental conflict. The same conflict that the [[Canadian]] 
state faces now in its own reconciliatory rhetoric.
 
Even if this land known as [[Canada]] were to be chopped in half and half returned 
to [[Indigenous]] nations, the relationship between a dense, centralized state and a
diverse, heterogeneous group of communities will always remain a gross imbalance
of power. There is no nation-to-nation relationship, it’s one of 
nation-to-nations.
 
In address of this problem, Communists always point to the same tired solutions 
that [[Canadian]]s do. Insisting that [[Indigenous]] people will form new federations 
like the AFN which will help to liaise between the parties. I am not inspired by
this solution.
 
Since the early days of this colonial project, settlers have been trying to 
figure out how [[Indigenous]] governance works. And when they did figure it out, 
they didn’t like it. It took too long. It was too [[flu]]id. And it didn’t govern 
the principles of [[property]] and ownership in a way conducive to their mission.
 
With the realization of the [[Indian]] Act, settlers set up neo-colonial [[government]]s
called Band Councils to replace traditional governance systems. These were 
elected positions, based on [[representative]] democracy mirroring the settler 
system. They considered this and only this legitimate and they enforced that 
legitimacy through coercive authority. Often at gunpoint.
 
Over time, with the [[Canadian]] state swelling to the unimaginable size that it has
now through the pillaging of stolen resources, many [[Indigenous]] nations tried to 
gain legitimacy by forming associations based on euro-centric modes of 
[[government]]. The Allied [[Nations]] of BC, the [[Indian]] Association of Alberta, the 
Métis Nation of [[Ontario]] (of which I am a part), culminating in the UN-inspired 
Assembly of [[First]] [[Nations]] (AFN).
 
The AFN doesn’t represent the needs and desires of [[Indigenous]] people just in the
same way the [[Canadian]] [[government]] doesn’t represent [[Canadian]]s. Representational 
democracy is a far cry from “rule by the people”. Pipeline Perry is busy handing
over Eagle Staffs to Justin [[[[Trudeau]]]] and thanking him for his charity while the 
rest of the assembly works with the RCMP to out land defenders across Turtle 
Island.
 
Now, I don’t blame our elders and community leaders for trying to do good for 
[[Indigenous]] peoples through the only system allowed by [[Canada]] – the current 
occupying force. But it’s not a secret that these systems also breed corruption.
For as many good and decent people there are in these positions, when people are
kept powerless on purpose, there will always be those who crave the authority of
the colonizer.
 
But, as long as there have been the forcefully implemented [[representative]] 
democracy of band council, the false nations of the MNO, and the coerced 
federalism of bodies like the AFN, there have been [[Indigenous]] people and 
communities fighting to dismantle them and return to systems of traditional 
governance. Smaller in size and locally based on belonging in a community.
 
Which brings me to anarchism.
 
Anarchism is a political philosophy – some might say a beautiful idea – that 
believes in self-governed societies based on voluntary association with one 
another. It advocates for non-hierarchical decision making, direct participation
in those decisions by affected communities, and autonomy for all living persons.
Furthermore, it leaves space for the valuation of non-human entities beyond 
their monetary worth or usefulness to human beings.
 
My [[Indigenous]] teachings have communicated to me that our communities are 
important, but so are we as individuals. Traditional ways saw decision making as
a participatory process, based on consensus, where communities made choices 
together. My teachings tell me that the land can offer us what we need, but 
never to take more than that. I see these ideas as fundamentally compatible.
 
Anarchism envisions a world where there exists a system of land stewardship, but
not ownership. A world where there are territories, but not borders. Although. 
sticking with my conceptual tool, I could call this association between diverse 
communities of settlers and [[Indigenous]] people a nations-to-nations relationship,
it wouldn’t be quite accurate either.
 
Anarchists don’t believe in nations. But I would argue neither do [[Indigenous]] 
folks. The word nation is a funny one, imposed on [[Indigenous]] communities as the 
most comprehensible label for their form of political organization. It’s useful 
in some contexts, often it’s not, and it has never quite fit.
 
[[Indigenous]] communities used to meet each spring to negotiate territories, form 
new agreements, and redistribute resources. Not all, of course, sometimes they 
just burned down their neighbors houses when they wanted them to move out. I am 
not here tonight to romanticize some pre-contact utopia free from oppression and
conflict.
 
But the conception of their “nations” was far different than the Westphalian 
model followed and imposed by [[Western]] society. Decisions were made by 
communities. Resources were shared. Membership was [[flu]]id and adoption common. 
Leaders were seen as spokespeople or advocates more than authorities. Positions 
of honour were given to those with life-long demonstrations of service, wisdom, 
and integrity. Those positions were also revocable. It’s possible to reconcile 
this with the anarchist idea of legitimate authority. This wasn’t anarchy 
exactly as we know it, but it was close.
 
It figures then that both liberal and Marxist theories have found a story to 
explain away the validity of such societies. Liberals were fond of social 
Darwinist theories of societal evolution that saw my ancestors as stuck in a 
stage of savagery. Marxists preferred their theory of historical materialism to 
claim that [[Indigenous]] societies were just a form of primitive communism, which 
would need to evolve through capitalism to ever reach the more respectable 
industrial communism they imagine.
 
I’d like to challenge this framework and, instead, offer a circular view of 
[[history]] embraced by my [[Indigenous]] teachings. I don’t think we need to “go back” 
along a linear timeline of so-called progression. There is no going back. But I 
want to return to the ideas of my ancestors and see it as moving forward, or 
maybe just as movement, directionless.
 
I’d like to see an anarchy of my people and the anarchy of settlers (also my 
people) enacted here together, side by side. With an equal distribution of 
power, each pursuing healthy relationships, acting from their own ideas and 
[[history]]. Just as the Two Row imagined.
 
I would like to see the centralized state of [[Canada]] dismantled. I’d like to see 
communities take up the responsibility of organizing themselves in the absence 
of said central authority. Community councils meeting weekly to discuss the 
needs of the community and the limitations of the land to provide for those 
needs, with a renewed emphasis on staying within those limits. Decisions made on
consensus, with a more active participation from all persons. Participation made
more accessible by the lessening of work necessary with the return to a 
subsistence economy rather than one of accumulation. I’d like to see more 
conversation, more cooperation, more shared production. A system that may have 
regional communication and collaboration, but always with an emphasis on the 
primacy of the community to determine its own needs and values.
 
I think beautiful things would follow from these changes naturally. I think that
if it were up to communities to decide whether it was worth it to open a gravel 
pit in their territory if it meant risking their only water source, we would see
less gravel pits. The [[violence]] of centralized authority means creating sacrifice
zones without a thought.
 
Even in this lovely future, there would still be conflict because conflict is a 
constant and that’s okay. Not all newly sovereign communities – [[Indigenous]] or 
settler – would immediately institute reciprocal relationships with the planet 
because, as we know, there are plenty of [[Indigenous]] capitalists out there 
alongside settler capitalists.
 
But the new relationship to place and focus on interdependence will give 
settlers a chance to genuinely form a new connection to this land themselves. To
adopt their own traditions and values that deal with the ethics of consumption 
and growth.
 
Over time, I think we would see the blending together of communities of settlers
and [[Indigenous]] folks who committed themselves to the same ideas. The love of 
land would bring some people closer. The new site of conflict would be less 
based on a racialized claim to land and more based on defending a worldview that
calls for its defense.
 
This. This point is where I think the word reconciliation could be used between 
our communities.
 
I identify as Michif-[[Cree]]. And I always list my other [[Europe]]an ancestry when I 
speak to people. Sometimes other [[Indigenous]] folks have asked me why I don’t just
claim myself as nêhiyaw-iskwêw (a [[Cree]] woman). But I tell them I want to find 
ways to honour my mother’s ancestors as well. And it was important to my 
grandfather that we remember that we were Métis, and to be proud of it.
 
I am proud to be Métis. The [[Cree]] used to call us “Otipemisiwak”, which means 
those who govern themselves. My direct ancestors and their communities waged a 
commendable resistance against the early [[Canadian]] state, carried in whispers as 
the Red River Rebellion. They lived a hard life on the margins of society and 
paid dearly for their resistance, surviving as squatters for almost 60 years. 
They called them the Road Allowance People.
 
To be Métis means I walk in two worlds. I consider it a gift. I didn’t always 
think that, but I do now.
 
I learn so much from my political community in Hamilton, constantly expanding my
ideas and challenging me to take bigger risks. I learn so much from my ceremony 
families at New Credit, Chippewa of the Thames, and Kipawa digging deep into my 
healing and my responsibilities.
 
Sometimes, I wish I could bring these two communities together more. I think 
they both have things to learn from the other. But it’s hard.
 
It takes a constant vigilance to both urge my settler friends to reconnect with 
land and spirit and to guard against them assuming too much. I love the phrase, 
“becoming [[Indigenous]] to place”, but I still can’t bring myself to use it. It’s 
too dangerous, people are too irresponsible.
 
The thing is, I don’t think settlers need to co-opt [[Indigenous]] worldviews or to 
start using our forms of governance. I really think anarchism can provide us 
with a political system parallel and harmonious. A set of ideas that can also 
allow for us to acknowledge the interdependence of the earth and to form new 
values based on that sacred connection.
 
Again, it’s not about going back. It’s about taking the knowledge that has 
survived and using it to create a more beautiful and just future. For all of us.
 
The [[Canadian]] state cannot reconcile with [[Indigenous]] communities. But you can, as
individuals. It starts with you making choices. Autonomously. With conviction.
 
[[May]]be you decide tonight that you still believe in supporting [[Canadian]] state-led
reconciliation, regardless of what I said. Okay. But own it. Don’t make yourself
out to be a [[revolution]]ary. Because your ideas aren’t.
 
[[May]]be you decide to leave here tonight and take your politics a little more 
seriously. Or maybe you already are an anarchist and everything I’ve said was a 
reminder or a validation. To you, I say remember your politics and choose your 
allies carefully.
 
Saying you support [[Indigenous]] [[sovereignty]] doesn’t mean backing every [[Indigenous]] 
person on every project. There are plenty of [[Indigenous]] misogynists and 
ladder-climbing politicians out there, and you don’t do me any favours by 
helping them gain power. Fight for liberatory ideas, not for nations or 
bloodlines.
 
We do this all the time. There are [[Indigenous]] people out there who oppose 
pipelines and those who support them, but we align ourselves with the 
resistance, so we are making choices already. Own it. It’s okay. It’s good to 
fight for the land and for freedom.
 
This also means you have to do your homework. Understand what struggles are 
about and know who is participating in them. Get to know those people. Build 
relationships. Build meaningful relationships outside of the occupation, as 
friends. It can’t start from a place of [[white]] guilt. Don’t get swept up in your 
own settler redemption story.
 
Remember that fighting for a future that sees justice for [[Indigenous]] communities
is not just done as comrades in their struggles. It should be a politic you live
every day. You can do this without speaking on their behalf. Be thoughtful. And 
creative. And, whenever possible, just work to undermine and attack the [[Canadian]]
state in all of your work. That is the work of decolonization. And it’s where 
you will find your own liberation too. This is your [[government]], not theirs, and 
it shouldn’t be their responsibility to tear it down.
 
Maarsii. Thank you. That’s all I have to say.
