title: Opinionwe’ll have herd immunity by april
---

Amid the dire [[Covid]] warnings, one crucial fact has been largely ignored: Cases are down 77% over the past six weeks. If a medication slashed cases by 77%, we’d call it a miracle pill. Why is the number of cases plummeting much faster than experts predicted?

In large part because natural [[immunity]] from prior infection is far more common than can be measured by [[testing]]. Testing has been capturing only from 10% to 25% of infections, depending on when during the [[pandemic]] someone got the [[virus]]. Applying a time-weighted case capture average of 1 in 6.5 to the cumulative 28 million confirmed cases would mean about 55% of [[American]]s have natural [[immunity]].

Now add people getting vaccinated. As of this week, 15% of [[American]]s have received the [[vaccine]], and the figure is rising fast. Former Food and Drug Commissioner Scott Gottlieb estimates 250 million doses will have been delivered to some 150 million people by the end of March.

There is reason to think the country is racing toward an extremely low level of infection. As more people have been infected, most of whom have mild or no symptoms, there are fewer [[American]]s left to be infected. At the current trajectory, I expect [[Covid]] will be mostly gone by [[April]], allowing [[American]]s to resume normal life.

Antibody studies almost certainly underestimate natural [[immunity]]. Antibody [[testing]] doesn’t capture antigen-specific T-cells, which develop “memory” once they are activated by the [[virus]]. Survivors of the [[1918]] [[Spanish]] [[flu]] were found in [[2008]]—90 years later—to have memory cells still able to produce neutralizing [[antibodies]].

[[Research]]ers at [[Sweden]]’s [Karolinska Institute](https://www.[[science]]direct.com/[[science]]/article/pii/S00928674[[2031]]0084) found that the percentage of people mounting a T-cell response after mild or asymptomatic [[Covid]]-19 infection consistently exceeded the percentage with detectable [[antibodies]]. T-cell [[immunity]] was even present in people who were exposed to infected family members but never developed symptoms. [A group of [[[[U.K.]]]] scientists](https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3364) in [[September]] pointed out that the medical community may be under-appreciating the prevalence of [[immunity]] from activated T-cells.

[[Covid]]-19 [[death]]s in the U.S. would also suggest much broader [[immunity]] than recognized. About 1 in 600 [[American]]s has [[died]] of [[Covid]]-19, which translates to a population fatality rate of about 0.15%. The [[Covid]]-19 infection fatality rate is about 0.23%. These numbers indicate that roughly two-thirds of the U.S. population has had the infection.

In my own conversations with medical experts, I have noticed that they too often dismiss natural [[immunity]], arguing that we don’t have data. The data certainly doesn’t fit the classic randomized-controlled-trial model of the old-guard medical establishment. There’s no control group. But the observational data is compelling.

I have argued for months that we could save more [[American]] lives if those with prior [[Covid]]-19 infection forgo [[vaccine]]s until all vulnerable seniors get their first dose. Several studies demonstrate that natural [[immunity]] should protect those who had [[Covid]]-19 until more [[vaccine]]s are available. Half my friends in the medical community told me: Good idea. The other half said there isn’t enough data on natural [[immunity]], despite the fact that reinfections have occurred in [less than 1% of people](https://www.gov.uk/[[government]]/news/past-[[covid-19]]-infection-provides-some-[[immunity]]-but-people-may-still-carry-and-transmit-[[virus]])—and when they do occur, the cases are mild.

But the consistent and rapid decline in daily cases since Jan. 8 can be explained only by natural [[immunity]]. Behavior didn’t suddenly improve over the holidays; [[American]]s traveled more over Christmas than they had since March. Vaccines also don’t explain the steep decline in [[January]]. Vaccination rates were low and they take weeks to kick in.

My prediction that [[Covid]]-19 will be mostly gone by [[April]] is based on laboratory data, mathematical data, published literature and conversations with experts. But it’s also based on direct observation of how hard [[testing]] has been to get, especially for the poor. If you live in a wealthy community where worried people are vigilant about getting tested, you might think that most infections are captured by [[testing]]. But if you have seen the many barriers to [[testing]] for low-income [[American]]s, you might think that very few infections have been captured at [[testing]] centers. Keep in mind that most infections are asymptomatic, which still triggers natural [[immunity]].

Many experts, along with politicians and journalists, are afraid to talk about herd [[immunity]]. The term has political overtones because some suggested the U.S. simply let [[Covid]] rip to achieve herd [[immunity]]. That was a reckless idea. But herd [[immunity]] is the inevitable result of viral spread and vaccination. When the chain of [[virus]] transmission has been broken in multiple places, it’s harder for it to spread—and that includes the new strains.

Herd [[immunity]] has been well-documented in the Brazilian city of Manaus, where [researchers in the Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00183-5/fulltext) reported the prevalence of prior [[Covid]]-19 infection to be 76%, resulting in a significant slowing of the infection. [[Doctors]] are watching a new strain that threatens to evade prior [[immunity]]. But countries where new variants have emerged, such as the [[[[U.K.]]]], South [[Africa]] and Brazil, are also seeing significant declines in daily new cases. The risk of new variants mutating around the prior vaccinated or natural [[immunity]] should be a reminder that [[Covid]]-19 will persist for decades after the [[pandemic]] is over. It should also instill a sense of urgency to develop, authorize and administer a [[vaccine]] targeted to new variants.

Some medical experts privately agreed with my prediction that there may be very little [[Covid]]-19 by [[April]] but suggested that I not to talk publicly about herd [[immunity]] because people might become complacent and fail to take precautions or might decline the [[vaccine]]. But scientists shouldn’t try to manipulate the public by hiding the truth. As we encourage everyone to get a [[vaccine]], we also need to reopen schools and society to limit the damage of closures and prolonged isolation. Contingency planning for an open economy by [[April]] can deliver hope to those in despair and to those who have made large personal sacrifices.
