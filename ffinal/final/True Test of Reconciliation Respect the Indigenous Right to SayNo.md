Conflict is coming. There is no getting around that fact. Anyone who believes 
that reconciliation will be about blanket exercises, cultural awareness 
training, visiting a native exhibit at a museum or hanging native artwork in 
public office buildings doesn’t understand how we got here. Reconciliation 
between [[Canada]] and [[Indigenous]] peoples has never been about [[multiculturalism]], 
diversity or inclusion. Reconciliation is not an affirmative-action program, nor
is it about adding token [[Indigenous]] peoples to committees, advisory groups or 
board rooms. We cannot tokenize our way out of this mess that [[Canada]] created. 
Real reconciliation requires truth be exposed, justice be done to make amends 
and then [[Canada]]’s discriminatory laws, policies, practices and societal norms be
reconciled with [[Indigenous]] rights, title, [[treaties]], laws and jurisdiction. That 
process of truth, justice and reconciliation will be painful. It requires a 
radical change. Nothing less than the transfer of land, wealth and power to 
[[Indigenous]] peoples will set things right. The true test of reconciliation will 
be whether [[Canada]] respects the [[Indigenous]] right to say ‘no.’
 
[[Canadian]] courts have been issuing decisions about [[Aboriginal]] rights and title 
and [[treaty]] rights, sending the strong message to [[government]]s that they must 
obtain the consent of [[Indigenous]] peoples before taking actions or making 
decisions that will impact our lives. Governments have not listened. [[Canada]]’s 
failure to listen is one of the reasons why [[Indigenous]] peoples spent more than 
25 years negotiating the United [[Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] 
Peoples which guarantees the right of [[Indigenous]] peoples to free, prior and 
informed consent. Article 19 of UNDRIP provides:
 
States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the [[indigenous]] peoples 
concerned through their own [[representative]] institutions in order to obtain their
free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or
administrative measures that may affect them.
 
Consent is a legal concept which can be defined as the voluntary acquiescence of
one person to the proposal of another. In general, it is the right to say yes or
no to something and/or put conditions on an agreement. Consent must be free from
misrepresentations, deceptions, fraud or duress. This is a very basic right, but
one which has been denied to [[Indigenous]] peoples since contact. Take for example,
the actions of [[Indian]] agents and police, who used food rations to extort sex 
from [[Indigenous]] women and girls. In the context of being forced to live on 
reserves, not being allowed to leave the reserve and being dependent on food 
rations, what real choice would a young girl have? Similarly, when police 
officers or judges detain [[Indigenous]] women and girls, drive them to secluded 
locations and force them to perform sexual acts — there is no real consent when 
the threat of lethal force or arrest on false charges is ever-present. This is 
especially so given our knowledge of the number of assaults and [[death]]s of our 
people in police custody. There was no consent when they stole our [[child]]ren and 
put them into residential schools, nor was there any consent when priests, nuns 
and others raped those [[child]]ren. There was no consent when doctors forcibly 
sterilized [[Indigenous]] women and girls — sometimes without their knowledge.
 
Today, the right of [[Indigenous]] peoples to free, prior and informed consent has 
become the central issue in [[Canada]]’s reconciliation agenda. Justin [[[[Trudeau]]]] 
campaigned on the promise of implementing UNDRIP into law and respecting the 
right of [[Indigenous]] peoples to say no. When asked by APTN host Cheryl McKenzie 
whether no would mean no under his [[government]], he responded “absolutely.” 
Another way of putting this is that [[Indigenous]] peoples could exercise their 
legal right to refuse to approve or authorize a project. This veto right stems 
from various sources, but primarily our inherent rights as [[Indigenous]] 
[[government]]s with our own laws and rules which govern our traditional 
territories. They may also come from specific [[Aboriginal]] rights, [[treaty]] rights 
and [[Aboriginal]] title. These rights are not only protected within our own 
[[Indigenous]] laws, but also section 35 of [[Canada]]’s Constitution Act, [[1982]] and 
various international human rights laws, including UNDRIP. Yet, after [[[[Trudeau]]]] 
announced his latest idea to create a legislative framework to recognize 
[[Indigenous]] rights and avoid litigation, Justice Minister Raybould stated clearly
that “consent doesn’t mean a veto” for [[Indigenous]] peoples.
 
So, we are now back where we started. [[Canada]] has not yet reconciled its laws, 
policies or political positions to the fact that [[Indigenous]] peoples have the 
right to say no to development projects on our lands. This means that conflict 
will continue to grow over mining, forestry, hydraulic fracking and pipelines on
[[Indigenous]] lands. The true test of reconciliation will inevitably play out on 
the ground, like it did in Oka, Ipperwash, Gustafsen Lake, Esgenoopetitj (Burnt 
Church) and Elsipogtog. Will [[Canada]] force the Kinder Morgan pipeline to go ahead
against the will of [[British]] Columbia and [[First]] [[Nations]]? Will [[Canada]] isolate and 
exclude [[First]] [[Nations]] who do not subscribe to the extinguishment requirements of
[[Canada]]’s land-claims process? What will happen to [[First]] [[Nations]] who stop 
provincial social workers and police officers from entering their reserves to 
steal more [[child]]ren into [[foster]] care? This will be the real test of our inherent
right to say no.
 
[[Canada]] will only truly give effect to reconciliation when [[Indigenous]] peoples 
have the right to say no — no to discriminatory [[government]] laws and policies; no
to federal and provincial control over our [[Nations]]; no to [[racism]] from society, 
industry and [[government]]; no to sexualized [[violence]], abuse and trafficking; no to
theft of our [[child]]ren into [[foster]] care and the im[[prison]]ment of our peoples; no 
to the ongoing theft of our lands and resources; and no to the contamination and
destruction of our lands, waters, plants, animals, birds and fish. The right to 
say no is the core of any future relationship with the [[Canadian]] state and its 
citizens. It’s a basic right — one which is grounded in our [[sovereignty]] as 
individuals and [[Nations]] to decide for ourselves the life we wish to live. [[Canada]]
has made it clear we have no right to say no, only an obligation to say yes. 
[[First]] [[Nations]] leaders and citizens should not wait to see how this plays out in 
court – they should assert and defend their right to say no now.
