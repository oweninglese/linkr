TORONTO — [[Canada]]’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg has a sample of the new [[corona[[virus]]]] that is causing infections in a number of countries, most notably [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]].

[[Canadian]] Lab Acquires Corona[[virus]] Sample. This undated file image released by the [[British]] Health Protection Agency shows an electron microscope image of a [[corona[[virus]]]], part of a family of [[virus]]es that cause ailments including the common cold and SARS, which was first identified last year in the Middle East.

Scientific director Dr. Frank Plummer says the lab obtained the [[virus]] from the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The [[Dutch]] lab was the one that first identified the new [[virus]] last [[June]] in a sample from a [[Saudi]] man who had [[died]] of a mysterious illness.

Plummer says the [[corona[[virus]]]] arrived at the Winnipeg facility on [[May]] 4.

He says the lab is growing up stocks of the [[virus]] and will use it to assess diagnostic tests being used in [[Canada]].

As well Winnipeg scientists plan to do some work to see which animal species can be infected with the new [[virus]].

That research will be done in conjunction with the [[Canadian]] Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal [[Disease]]s. The animal lab is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.

The Winnipeg lab made diagnostic tests months ago, based on genetic sequence data of the new [[virus]]. Those tests have been in the hands of provincial labs since last fall, Plummer says.

To date about a handful of people have been tested for the infection in [[Canada]], but all the tests have come back negative.

But having the actual [[virus]] to work with will allow the Winnipeg scientists to start developing a blood test to look for past infection with the [[virus]], Plummer says.

“Having the actual [[virus]] … allows you to develop antibody tests which are pretty key for a diagnosis of viral infections,” he says.

“The [[virus]] is only there for a short period of time so you can’t really tell whether somebody had a past infection or not whereas [[antibodies]] allow you to do that.”

New confirmed cases of the [[virus]] have been emerging almost daily from what appears to be a large and potentially ongoing outbreak in eastern [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]], near the Persian Gulf.

That outbreak reportedly started in a hospital, but it’s not clear at this point whether all the cases are linked to the hospital anymore or whether some spread in the community is occurring.

The information released by [[Saudi]] officials has been sparse and generally has not indicated whether the cases are members of the same family — which might suggest limited human-to-human spread — or unrelated individuals. The latter pattern of infections might suggest the [[virus]] is spreading more easily among people.

Plummer says the situation is concerning, though he noted he is always worried when a new [[virus]] begins to infect people.

“There are certainly a lot of questions about this [[virus]],” he said.

“And because the information coming out has been a little bit … hazy, it’s really hard to know what actually has been done and what’s known.”

On Tuesday the [[Saudi]] Ministry of Health reported it has confirmed infections in two health-care workers — identified by some news outlets as nurses.

This is the first time they have acknowledged spread of the [[virus]] to health-care workers and it is an unsettling sign. With an outbreak underway, hospitals should be requiring staff coming in contact with possible cases to use what are called barrier precautions — gloves, gowns, respirators to protect the nose and mouth, and goggles to protect the eyes.

During the [[2003]] SARS outbreak, the [[virus]] got a real foothold in hospitals, spreading among health-care workers and their patients.

Experts who have been watching this new [[virus]] — which is a member of the same family as the SARS [[corona[[virus]]]] — have been worrying this SARS cousin will follow the same path.

With those two additional cases, the global case count rises to 40, with at least 20 [[death]]s. Most of those cases have occurred in [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]], though Jordan, [[Qatar]] and the United Arab [[Emirates]] have also reported cases. [[France]], [[Britain]] and Germany have had imported infections and in the case of [[Britain]] and [[France]]. secondary spread from the imported cases.

To date [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] has confirmed 31 cases (including the traveller from [[Britain]]) with at least 15 [[death]]s.
