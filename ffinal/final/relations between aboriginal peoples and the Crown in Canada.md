Common [[property]] and regional
[[sovereignty]]: relations between
[[aboriginal]] peoples and the [[Crown]] in
[[Canada]]
Peter J. Usher

In a world where even nation-states have declining power and

authority in the face of global markets, international [[trade]] agreements,
and harmonised laws and regulations, what does [[sovereignty]] mean at
the subnationallevel? And what is the connection between common
[[property]] and [[sovereignty]] at the subnationallevel? What challenges
and opportunities confront minority [[indigenous]] populations in these
contemporary circumstances? The situation of [[aboriginal]] peoples in
[[Canada]] provides distinctive perspectives on these questions. In our
country, new understandings are being reached, new arrangements
forged and implemented, but also, new difficulties and challenges are
emerging.

Recognition and disregard of [[aboriginal]] [[property]] and
[[sovereignty]]
[[Aboriginal]] peoples not only used and occupied their territories, they
also regulated access to their lands and resources by outsiders and
access within them by members. [[Aboriginal]] [[property]] in lands and
resources existed in at least three forms: as a discrete physical space, as
a set of relations among the landholding group, and a right in the eyes
of others. Property relations are, of course, rules about who has rights

to what, and how they can exercise those rights. They are thus a
fundamental element of [[sovereignty]] or self-[[government]].
In [[1763]], a Royal Proclamation declared [[British]] recognition of
[[aboriginal]] title and rights in what is now [[Canada]], although the specific
content of this recognition, and of [[Canada]]'s obligations in respect of it,
have been much debated politically and in the courts. At the least, we
can say that the Proclamation recognised title insofar as it established a
lawful process for obtaining [[aboriginal]] lands by negotiation and [[treaty]],
and that until this process had occurred, [[aboriginal]]s were to remain
unmolested in their use of their land and under the protection of the
[[Crown]]. It also, by implication at least, recognised [[aboriginal]] [[sovereignty]]
insofar as it acknowledged [[treaty]]-making partners capable of acting
politically on behalf of landholding groups.
How the recognition of [[aboriginal]] title and rights evolved in
practice in [[Canada]] is a sorry story, which can only be highlighted here. 1
[[Canadian]] courts have from time to time acknowledged the existence of
[[aboriginal]] title, but characterised it merely as usufructuary, or more
recently as sui generis, which gives the appearance of recognition while
at the same time emptying it of practical content and effect. So it came
about that in the eyes of the law, [[aboriginal]] rights in land and resources
(when acknowledged) were not exclusive, provided neither defence
nor remedy against nuisance, trespass, or expropriation, and did not
bind or encumber third parties granted competing land or resource
rights by the [[Crown]].
The [[treaty]]-making process, as it evolved for over a century and a
half after the Royal Proclamation, was intended by the colonial
[[government]] and later [[Canada]] to clear the way for settlement and
development. According to the English language versions as published
by [[Canada]], these [[treaties]] constituted surrenders of vast territories in
exchange for limited hunting rights on unoccupied [[Crown]] lands, cash
payments for supplies and personal annuities, and reserve lands which
typically amounted to no more than one per cent of the ceded territory.
What [[Indian]]s regarded as their own lands on which they would be
self-governing, [[Canada]] cast as Dominion lands 'set apart for [[Indian]]s'
([[Indian]] Act, s.18(1)), temporarily it hoped, as places of confinement
and assimilation. The effect was to set aside [[property]] for [[Indian]] use,
but not to recognise [[Indian]] relations of [[property]], and certainly not
their communal nature or its implications.
Further, the division of powers between the Dominion Government
and the provinces at Confederation ([[British]] North America Act [[1867]])

was considered to have fully allocated [[sovereignty]] in [[Canada]], leaving
no room for the exercise of [[aboriginal]] [[sovereignty]], perhaps least of all
with respect to the disposition and management of land, water, and
natural resources.
[[Canada]]'s unilateral intepretation of the [[treaties]], its Constitution,
and the [[Indian]] Act, combined to deny completely [[aboriginal]] [[sovereignty]] and self-[[government]]. Two hundred years after the Royal
Proclamation, [[Canada]] was firmly committed to an assimilationist
policy, and regarded the [[treaties]] as quaint anachronisms that could
and should be disregarded if they stood in the way of the public good
(which [[government]] regarded as also the [[aboriginal]] good). The idea
that [[aboriginal]] rights might persist and have substance outside of the
[[treaty]] areas (the substantial part of [[Canada]] not yet included in the
[[treaty]]-making process when it ended in [[1930]]) was simply not considered.

Reclaiming [[property]] and [[sovereignty]]-two directions
When the movement to reclaim [[aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights gathered
momentum in the [[1970]]s, there was a range of approaches based in no
small measure on [[aboriginal]] peoples' specific historical experience. In
the southern, settled areas of [[Canada]], the focus was on the
development of self-[[government]] on the reserves. There was little
interest in (or hope for) the 99 per cent of land that had been lost.
Other than exercising hunting and fishing rights, there was little
assertion of territorial rights on settled and alienated land. In the far
north, where Inuit and [[Indian]]s had experienced little impact from
settlement and development, and where the use of land and water
continued largely uninterrupted, the assertion of rights was over the
entire territory. In the mid-north, where although use of off-reserve
lands continued, there had been progressive encroachment and
restriction by development activities, [[government]] regulations, and
settlers, the assertion of rights was also territorially extensive, but
there was much emphasis on seeking remedies for past damages. In
the northern [[treaty]] areas, [[Indian]]s saw these incursions and damages
as a long [[history]] of [[treaty]] violations, and signs of a [[treaty]] partner no
longer to be trusted. 2
The effect was that in the south, and to a large extent in the midnorth, [[Indian]]s pursued autonomy and [[sovereignty]], even if over
limited territories, whereas in the far north, Inuit and to some extent
[[Indian]]s sought to retain a range of rights over their entire territories

but were more prepared to enter into relations of partnership and
cooperation. On the one hand, coexistence in separate spheres, on the
other, cooperation and participation. This is necessarily an oversimplification, but it provides some insight into different outcomes in
the north and south of [[Canada]], and to the successes and limitations of
comprehensive claims agreements.

Modern comprehensive claims agreements
As a result of certain political and judicial events in the early [[1970]]s,
[[Canada]] acknowledged that there were outstanding [[aboriginal]]
interests in unceded land and that it was prepared to negotiate
modem [[treaties]] on the basis of them (Chretien [[1973]]). The Office of
[[Native]] Claims was given a mandate to negotiate, in exchange for
extinguishment, certain land and resource benefits, title to a limited
quantum of lands (including subsurface rights to a small proportion
thereof), preferential or exclusive access to fish and wildlife, and
limited participation in the management of these resources, and
monetary compensation. Other benefits not related to lands and
resources were also offered, but the overall package did not include
self-[[government]] ([[Canada]] [[1981]]).3
The new policy included some significant departures from the old
[[treaty]] pattern, with respect to lands, resources, and environment. For
our purposes, these were
.. the land quantum to be negotiated was far greater than what
was provided for (although not necessarily greater than
what [[Indian]] signatories had understood they would get) in
the numbered [[treaties]], although much of this would consist
of surface title only
.. the lands selected would be held in freehold directly by an
[[aboriginal]] corporate entity, rather than by [[Canada]] for the
benefit of [[aboriginal]] people
.. cash compensation for lost lands would be substantial, and
would be paid to an [[aboriginal]] corporate entity rather than
to individuals
.. hunting and fishing rights would be exclusive or
preferential, and to some extent compensable
.. [[aboriginal]] people would have some involvement in wildlife
and environmental management.

The land, resource, and environment regimes established under the
comprehensive claims process provide some measure of protection of
land and resources from the adverse effects of development, and also
for mitigation and compensation where such effects do occur. These
modem [[treaties]] thus address problems perhaps not foreseen, and
certainly not explicitly dealt with, in the historic [[treaties]]. They do so
by acknowledging and balancing both [[aboriginal]] and non-[[aboriginal]]
interests throughout the traditional territory. Some incidents of
[[aboriginal]] title are formally recognised on all lands (except the very
limited areas in freehold tenure), more in some categories of land than
in others, yet nowhere are they complete.
The modem [[treaties]] also provide an institutional framework for
the continuing negotiation and mutual accommodation of [[aboriginal]]
and non-[[aboriginal]] interests in the governance of land, resources, and
environment. They provide for [[aboriginal]] involvement in the
management of the entire territory, but not their exclusive governance
or [[sovereignty]] over any of it. This is a vision of integration and
participation, of a continuing and evolving relationship between
partners, rather than of separation and coexistence (Usher [[1997]]).
What follows is a description of what happens when [[aboriginal]]
rights have been recognised and codified, and must then be exercised
in a situation where the presence, interests, and rights of others, both
within the territory or 'settlement region' and outside of it, must be
acknowledged and negotiated. In most of the cases referred to, the
primary economic orientation of the [[aboriginal]] population is a mixed,
subsistence-based economy, based on local-level subsistence and
commercial exploitation of fisheries and wildlife, employment, and
transfer payments. Industrial employment, where it occurs, is in the
minerals, oil and gas sectors. There is no agriculture, and with few
exceptions, no forestry or pastoralism.

The provisions for co-management
The principle of co-management is perhaps the most innovative and
yet least understood elements of the modem [[treaties]]. It applies not
only to wildlife and fisheries -the so-called 'traditional' resourcesbut also to environmental protection and regulation, and land use
planning. 4
The basic structure of co-management consists of boards or
committees responsible for specific management areas such as

wildlife, fisheries, impact screening and review, land use planning,
and water management. Members are usually appointed in equal
numbers by [[government]]s and beneficiary organisations.
Geographically, the jurisdiction of these boards extends to all of the
lands within the settlement area, whether in [[aboriginal]], [[Crown]], or
private tenure. The boards are technically advisory to the appropriate
minister, and do not replace existing [[government]] agencies. They are
intended to guide the overall direction of policy, and have a range of
powers from making binding decisions, approvals, advice, and
[[research]] direction. Here, for example, is how the role of the [[Nunavut]]
Wildlife Management Board (NWMB) is described in the [[Nunavut]]
Land Claims Agreement
Recognizing that Government retains ultimate responsibility for
wildlife management, the NWMB shall be the main instrument of
wildlife management in the [[Nunavut]] Settlement Area and the main
regulator of access to wildlife and have the primary responsibility in
relation thereto (Department of [[Indian]] Affairs and [[Northern]]
Development 1993:5.2.33).

Comprehensive claims have not been the only basis for the
development of co-management. Some important and enduring
examples pre-date many of the claims, and limited forms of comanagement have been implemented outside of the comprehensive
claims areas. However, the claims-based regimes are the strongest and
most enduring, not least because they are constitutionally protected
under section 35 of the Constitution Act, [[1982]]. They cannot be
unilaterally disbanded or ignored by [[Canada]], or by its provinces and
territories.
At the time that co-management options were first seriously
negotiated in comprehensive claims, the alternative was continued
and more comprehensive devolution to the territorial [[government]]s.
Instead, at least a nominal form of power-sharing was the outcome.
Governments were not entirely averse to this compromise, and
certainly preferred it to [[aboriginal]] self-[[government]] with respect to
lands and resources. The Supreme Court's Sparrow decisions also
provided an impetus for co-management--<:onsultation has become
one of the key tests of constitutionally acceptable conservation
limitations on [[aboriginal]] harvesting rights. The co-management
boards provide a useful 'single window' for [[government]]s to deal with
specific resource issues. With respect to wildlife and fisheries, comanagement is a means of enlisting harvester cooperation to ensure

conservation, as an alternative to deploying draconian and expensive
(but often unsuccessful) enforcement measures.
From an [[aboriginal]] perspective, co-management establishes a
principle completely ignored (if not explicitly rejected) in [[Canada]]'s
interpretation of the historic [[treaties]]. It is that [[aboriginal]] people retain,
as a result of claims settlements, some rights not only of use but of
management, and in effect governance, that apply on all [[Crown]] lands
and in more limited respects on private lands, throughout the
traditional territory or 'settlement region'. The modem [[treaties]] create
an institutional basis for cooperation and coexistence, for problem
solving and for the harmonising of mutual interests, with respect to all
lands and resources. This is quite different from the traditional denial
of all collective [[aboriginal]] rights save residual hunting and fishing
rights outside of reserve lands. In most cases where it has been
implemented it has been a counterweight and buffer to the
progressive encroachment and restriction on the use of customary
lands and resources, to harvest disruption, and to the loss of social and
cultural as well as economic values.
On the other hand, the emerging pattern is not one of selfdetermination or autonomy. It would certainly appear, based on the
structures and mandates established by the comprehensive claims,
that the state management system has been retained. The general
pattern is that allocation and licensing is delegated to the boards and
the local harvester organisations, but management for conservation is
reserved to [[government]]s, with the boards having only an advisory
role (although in practice their decisions are rarely if ever varied or
rejected). The boards are technically institutions of public [[government]],
on which [[aboriginal]]s are guaranteed equal representation with
[[government]]s. The co-management boards thus do not replace existing
resource management agencies-at most they provide guidance to
them. This is less than what many, and perhaps most, harvesters
wanted.

Co-management in practice
Co-management has been implemented in [[Canada]] in a variety of
situations since the early [[1980]]s. Some of these have been claims-based,
others have been cobbled together as ad hoc solutions to land and
resource management crises. In both cases, there have been notable
achievements in conservation through self-regulation, community

land use and conservation planning, co-management of national
parks, impact screening and review, negotiating interjurisdictional
agreements on resource access and management, and in problem
solving generally.
Most co-management boards, and especially the claims-based ones,
are bilateral arrangements between [[aboriginal]] peoples and [[government]]s, and hence do not necessarily include all interested parties. That
is probably one reason that boards have often been able to achieve
consensus over basic management objectives, for example, management for subsistence in the case of the Beverly-Qamanirjuaq Caribou
Management Board (BQCMB) (Usher 1993). As well, the boards are
mandated to implement the objectives of the claims agreements,
which in the case of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA), for example,
clearly link [[aboriginal]] harvesting rights with conservation (Staples
[[1997]]). However potentially competing interests such as resident sport
hunters or the guiding industry are not directly represented on the
boards (although [[government]]s may choose in some cases to nominate
such individuals as their [[representative]]s). While this has not been a
significant problem in the Northwest [[Territories]] (NWT), it accounts for
some of the differences in board structures in the [[Yukon]], and for some
of the resistance to co-management in the provincial North (see, for
example, Brooke [[1997]], Larcombe [[1997]], and Penn [[1997]]). Where third
party interests are well established, multi-party approaches at the local
level as in the Shuswap pilot project in [[British]] Columbia (Pinkerton,
Moore and Fortier [[1997]]) or the Barriere Lake agreement in [[Quebec]]
(Notzke [[1997]]) are likely to be essential elements of success.
Some observers have suggested that co-management
offers a potential bridge between [[indigenous]] and state systems of
knowledge and management (Usher [[1987]], Osherenko [[1988]]). The record
of achievement in this regard is mixed, but co-management has
provided a forum or venue for continuing negotiation over matters
crucial to both [[aboriginal]] peoples and [[government]]s. Whether the
integration or bridging of traditional and scientific knowledge is always
an appropriate or achievable objective of co-management remains to be
seen. One substantial achievement in most cases has been agreement on
[[research]] objectives and methods, and the sharing of data. The scientific
[[research]] on which management is based is undertaken with the
knowledge and consent of harvesters (for example the BQCMB) and
often the [[research]] priorities, design, and budgets are effectively directed
by the co-management board and, for example in the IPA, the

Inuvialuit Game Council. In the NWT, the boards have their own
secretariats with technical as well as adminis-trative capacity, hence
[[aboriginal]] [[representative]]s have access to expertise outside of the line
management agencies. The composition of boards is quite similar in
all of the agreements, in particular the provision for equality of
representation. What is crucial to the outcome is who in practice
appoints (or which set of interests appoints) the members, the effective
mandate and accountability of the members, and the actual operating
procedures. These factors can either serve to paper over and suppress
real differences, or give proper recognition and expression of them.
The experience of most boards shows that consensus often builds
over time among board members, and the agencies they represent. As
already mentioned, co-management board decisions are rarely if ever
varied or rejected by the ministers they advise. However this is not
sufficient, at least on the govemment side, to bind all those whose
actions (or inaction) may have an impact on management. For example,
support for IFA implementation on the part of local or regional [[government]] agencies is not necessarily sustained at headquarters, and there
are some govemment departments not directly represented on the
boards who are indifferent at best, or hostile at worst, to board
recommendations (Staples [[1997]]).
The costs of implementation and of effective participation are
proving to be substantial: consistent attention, expert [[research]] and
advice, and extensive travel are required. The final agreements themselves do not specify what human and financial resources are required
to implement their provisions. That has been a matter for subsequent
negotiations, and has sometimes proved the source of fundamental
disagreement or dissatisfaction between parties and beneficiaries.
There has been a range of responses to co-management initiatives
by [[aboriginal]] groups. Some have found that their co-management
arrangements suit their needs well, and that they can use them to their
advantage. Others find co-management at least acceptable in as much
as it is a significant improvement over the former closed-door system
of management. Still others have no desire to co-manage resources
with outsiders but seek exclusive management authority within a
limited geographical area. In assessing co-management, it is necessary
to consider the diversity of circumstances surrounding its negotiation
and implementation.
There is some evidence that co-management is more likely to be
preferred where migratory or transboundary populations are

involved. In such cases, [[government]]s and users from several
jurisdictions are brought together in a single forum. Perhaps not
surprisingly, those groups (such as the Inuvialuit) most dependent on
migratory species such as caribou, waterfowl, whales, and polar bears,
are co-management's most convinced advocates. They regard it as the
key to resource conservation, and to social and political stability
respecting resource harvesting, despite some day-to-day problems and
frustrations. By contrast, the Anishinabe of northwestern [[Ontario]]
historically relied on fish and wildlife resources with quite restricted
ranges, or even non-mobile resources such as wild rice. These
resources could be and were managed exclusively within a limited
area, hence the benefits of co-management are less obvious (Chapeskie
[[1995]]). The differences in environmental circumstances between these
two [[aboriginal]] peoples is compounded by both ideology and historical
experience-certainly, in the case of the Anishinabe, of a much more
thorough and devastating [[history]] of progressive encroachment and
restriction (Usher et al. [[1992]]).
There is no one answer to the question of whether co-management
has proven an advantage more to [[government]]s or to beneficiaries, or
for that matter, whether it has been to the equal advantage of both.
Nor is it clear whether it is better to have single, comprehensive
boards dealing with large areas (such as the NWMB which covers
about one-fifth of [[Canada]]), or several more specialised boards (as in
the case of the IFA boards), or local, community-based boards in which
non-[[aboriginal]] residents participate (such as the Renewable Resource
Councils in the [[Yukon]]).
Nonetheless, three features of the claims-based regimes appear to
be critical to the successful implementation of co-management (Usher
[[1995]]). First, the co-management structures, and their mandate,
objectives, and mode of operation, are themselves negotiated. This is
very different from inviting people to sit on a body whose mandate
and operations have already been determined unilaterally. Second,
[[aboriginal]] members of claims-based boards are politically accountable
appointees of one of the parties to an agreement, not simply 'stakeholders' or 'users', as is the case on the ad hoc boards. In some of the
latter type of boards, (including the well-known BQCMB), only
[[government]]s are signatories to the management agreement. The rights
and powers of users are specified but not guaranteed; they are granted
by [[government]]s and do not constitute a recognition of existing rights.
Third, only the claims-based arrangements are permanent. The ad hoc

arrangements are in place only for a limited period, subject to discretionary renewal and funding by [[government]].
Co-management may work best when the parties have similar
interests in and objectives regarding the resources in question. Ideally
each contributes its own knowledge to achieve a shared objective of
sustainability. If objectives are not shared, then knowledge may not be
shared and communication will be impaired. This problem is likely to
increase as the number of parties to co-management increases.

Benefits of co-management
The key elements of the modem [[treaties]] regarding land tenure,
resource access, and co-management provide for enforceable rights of
[[property]] and governance. The resulting security of tenure, access, and
management regime provide essential conditions for local economic
growth and social development. Typically, where co-management has
been implemented, local and regional economies can be characterised
as mixed, subsistence-based economies. They are certainly not traditional in the sense of being antiquated or undeveloped, but northern
[[aboriginal]] communities have quite distinctive social, cultural, and
economic objectives and needs that are not fully addressed by the
standard models of economic development. The security achieved by
the claims agreements is important not so much for capital investment
by lending institutions, as for the investment in social capital by [[aboriginal]] people themselves in the form of the s[[kill]]s, knowledge, and
values required for harvesting. For the most part, such communities
are quite prepared to work with outside resource development interests
if they can maximise the economic benefits, minimise environmental
and social damages, and retain their renewable-resource based
harvesting economies for both subsistence and commercial purposes.
Under the modem agreements, not only are [[aboriginal]] priorities
with respect to harvesting guaranteed, but co-management
arrangements provide the tools of cooperative governance necessary
to secure both harvesting and marketing in a national and international context. [[Aboriginal]] peoples have been involved in
international markets for centuries, and have no interest in returning
to some imaginary pristine autarky. Yet this market access is now
under unprecedented assault from an urban public increasingly
divorced from, and sometimes hostile to, the realities of the
sustainable use of living resources.

I 113

Through implementing co-management regimes, [[aboriginal]] people
not only continue harvesting but are learning new and quite different
s[[kill]]s: negotiating, marketing, finding out how the larger world works
and how to operate in it, directing [[research]], setting priorities, and in
general defending and advancing their interests in a positive way. In
doing so they reinforce their collective sense of the role and importance of their common [[property]] arrangements and subsistence systems,
and their culturally-based knowledge, values, and s[[kill]]s that are
required to make these things work in contemporary conditions.
Scientists and administrators also learn how to expand the knowledge
inputs required to operationalise modem systems of conservation and
development to include traditional environmental knowledge and
understanding.
Another feature of the modem agreements is the provision for
negotiating impact benefit agreements where third parties seek to
exercise their resource rights on [[aboriginal]] lands (where [[aboriginal]]
entities hold surface but not subsurface titles, or where prior [[Crown]]
grants survive). These agreements may include such matters as project
mitigation, environmental monitoring, compensation for loss of use or
direct damages to the environment as well as to [[property]], all of which
require continuing cooperative arrangements between the parties and
which may also be characterised as a form of voluntary comanagement.
Such arrangements are increasingly (although by no means
universally) accepted by large resource [[companies]] as good business
sense in that they provide for certainty with respect to development
and investment which the state, on its own, is unable to fully
guarantee except by the most draconian and publicly unacceptable
methods.
One feature of co-management is that it brings people together in a
way that they can learn to respect each other and understand their
interests, priorities, and perspectives. When this happens, people are
more likely to make accommodations, and more likely to see the
process as mutually beneficial rather than as a zero-sum game.
The process of co-management is costly, but it is also necessary to
look at avoided costs. Direct actions, disruptions, and court challenges
are also costly. In the historic [[treaty]] areas where these issues remain
unresolved, when [[aboriginal]] people want to do things they believe
they have a right to do, they act. When charged and prosecuted, they
defend themselves in court on the basis of their [[aboriginal]] or [[treaty]]

rights. Some of these cases have significantly enlarged both the legal
content and the public understanding of these rights, but there have
also been some significant losses. Any major case that eventually goes
all the way up to the Supreme Court is likely to take years and cost
millions of dollars, all of which creates uncertainty for both customary
common [[property]] holders and potential investors.
On balance, experience suggests that contemporary comanagement arrangements between [[aboriginal]] peoples and [[Canadian]]
[[government]]s, as well as third parties, meet the tests of conservation,
equity, and efficiency, and therefore provide the conditions for
sustainable development. Experience also suggests that the principles
of co-management can be applied to other spheres, ranging from the
international (such as the recently established [[Arctic]] Council and its
role in environmental protection, and the standing it provides to
[[aboriginal]] political organisations). They can also be applied to other
resource management issues at the regional level such as nonrenewable resource development and to program delivery relating to
such matters as health and education.
There is a new way of doing business in the [[Canadian]] North, and
many are recognising its useful and beneficial aspects. Nothing is
permanent, however, and the maintenance of effective comanagement requires ongoing vigilance and the solution of new
problems.

Challenges for co-management
In the long run, co-management arrangements and agreements will

only be as good as the parties are prepared to make them. There is a
special requirement for vigilance on the part of the weaker party,
which is invariably the [[aboriginal]] party. Comprehensive claims
agreements are protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act,
[[1982]], and their provisions are paramount over any other federal,
provincial, or territorial legislation which may be inconsistent with
them. Nonetheless, [[government]]s must constantly be reminded of
these facts, especially when drafting new legislation. Although there
are arbitration provisions under the claims agreements, there are no
enforceable penalties for federal non-compliance.
It is up to the [[aboriginal]] party to ensure that the rest of the world
complies with their agreements. The costs and complications of
effectively administering such large tracts of land bring both problems

and opportunities. The slowness of actual demarcation on the ground
has been a problem where development pressures are great, as in the
case of forestry adjacent to southern [[Cree]] lands in [[Quebec]] (Penn [[1997]]).
Overly prescriptive regimes which cannot evolve and adapt to changing conditions will ultimately fail to address key problems, and the
parties will eventually bypass them (Brooke [[1997]], Wlikinson and
Vmcelli [[1997]]).
Although the courts in recent years have led the way in reinterpreting the historic [[treaty]] provisions in a more liberal and expansive
fashion, this cannot be relied on in the case of the modern [[treaties]].
[[Canadian]] courts already regard these as more equitable contracts in
which the [[aboriginal]] parties had full capacity to negotiate agreements
and to understand the consequences of what they had agreed to.
There has to be political will to implement agreements. The opportunities for slippage in the first few critical years of implementation,
when operational patterns are getting established, are substantial. It is
the [[aboriginal]] party that must seize the initiative and ensure that
implementation is effective.
Co-management thus clearly requires mutual respect and equitable
political relations. But it also requires substantial resources to
implement. Without adequate resources, there can be no effective
participation in co-management regimes, which requires (among other
things) travel, translation, access to information, and continuity of
representation. The seats may be there, but that is not much help if
people have neither the money nor the capacity to fill them, or if for
these and other reasons they are discouraged from filling them.
The pattern of modern comprehensive claims settlements was set
in the [[1980]]s when [[government]]s still spent money freel)" and took an
activist role in land and resource management. Periodic renegotiation
of implementation funding (which after initial one-time implementation
tasks relates largely to the co-management system) will get tougher.
Disputes may now more likely occur not over differing legal interpretations of substantive obligations, but what expenditures are
required to meet these obligations. New measures and practices of
management effectiveness and efficiency will be required. How to [[trade]]
off higher costs of doing business, and of conducting [[research]], against
reduced enforcement costs, crisis avoidance, and enhanced sustainability? Co-management can become a victim of its own success: to
the extent that it reduces conflict, it becomes less noticeable in the eyes
of those who ultimately allocate the funds.

Another area future disagreement may be the role of [[government]]
in land and environmental management. In an era of downsizing and
privatisation, what are the implications of [[government]] withdrawal? It
is hard to continue to implement an agreement when one partner gets
up from the table and walks away. Problems may also emerge in the
maintenance of the essential character of common [[property]], with the
creation of corporate and state-like entities under comprehensive
claims, although it is too early to assess actual developments.
Modem [[treaties]] have secured a legal base for [[aboriginal]] [[property]].
The collective title is held by corporate entities, with certain important
limits with respect to transfer or alienation to non-beneficiaries. Is
there a risk that in the long run collective [[property]] can be converted to
private tenure? I believe that [[aboriginal]] [[property]] systems are in
principle recognisable by the common law system even if they are
different, but it will be a challenge to characterise them in this way
without undermining them. There is also the question of whether,
under conditions of scarcity or economic difficulty, limited entry and
[[trade]]able resource rights could emerge even in the face of fundamental
values of universal access. Customary [[property]] relations do evolve
and change as new conditions arise.
Boundary issues may also be problematic. Traditional use and
occupancy are the basis of [[aboriginal]] claims in law and policy. What
are the implications of using this concept to define the territorial limits
of jurisdiction of 'state-like' institutions? The modem [[treaty]] process is
creating subnational (or sub-territorial) political and administrative
units, with mandates and responsibilities organised along state or
corporate lines. This is very far from the recognition and entrenchment
of traditional [[aboriginal]] forms of socio-territorial organisation. By
reifying what were formerly [[flu]]id and imprecise boundaries according
to contemporary requirements of state administration (even if an
[[aboriginal]] [[government]] is in charge), there is a probability of separation
of title and use over time, contrary to [[aboriginal]] principles and
traditions. Some evidence of the social difficulties this poses with
particular respect to registered trap lines have been reported in the
[[Cree]] area of [[Quebec]] (McDonnell and La Rusic [[1987]]) and the [[Yukon]].
The emergence of 'overlap' and boundary disputes among neighbouring claimant groups is also an indication of the effect of creating state-like
jurisdictional boundaries.
Finally, there is the question of how far the model can spread. The
most successful examples of implementation come, not by coincidence,

from the territorial North. The conditions conducive to success there
have not held to the same degree in the provincial North, where third
parties are more involved, and more numerous and varied resident
interests and [[property]] rights are at stake. Because [[aboriginal]] people
are constitutionally a federal responsibility, provincial [[government]]s
have historically represented settler interests, and still do. [[Crown]] land
disposition and resource management are provincial responsibilities,
south of the 60th parallel, and there is much more resistance to comanagement which is seen, perhaps especially in [[Quebec]], as an attack
on provincial [[sovereignty]] and territorial integrity. Land claims agreements are meeting increasing resistance in the provinces from a
growing sector of the public that attacks them as 'race-based privilege',
as a form of apartheid, and as contrary to democratic and egalitarian
principles.

Conclusion
Where [[aboriginal]] groups have embraced co-management, they have
embarked on a path of partnership and cooperation with [[government]],
sometimes the private sector, and in effect with other [[Canadian]]
citizens. There is an alternative, but it implies the maintenance of
distance, isolation, and to some extent social if not economic autarky.
While [[aboriginal]] and historic [[treaty]] rights are protected under the
constitution, in the absence of negotiated agreements it is still left to
the courts to determine what they are. This is a slow, uncertain, and
uneven process, and it is possible that the high-water mark has
already been reached in [[Canada]], and the tide is ebbing. Waiting to
negotiate until formal recognition of certain principles occurs, or until
certain processes are in place, is also risky. True equality cannot be
achieved by declaration alone, and it cannot be wished into existence.
Imbalances of demographic and economic power are facts of life in
[[Canada]] and will continue to be such for a very long time. None of this
is to deny the tremendous symbolic importance of formal acts of
recognition, but rights, once acknowleged, have to be exercised in a
real world where neither [[property]] nor [[sovereignty]] are unbounded.
What [[Canadian]] [[aboriginal]] peoples have achieved through the
comprehensive claims process and through the implementation of comanagement regimes is far from perfect. In comparison to the situation
of [[indigenous]] peoples in other countries, however, much has been
achieved by at least some [[Canadian]] [[aboriginal]] peoples to secure rights

of tenure, access, and management of their lands, resources, and
environment.
Co-management is not autonomy or self-determination. But it is
much more than consultation or participation. Property and
management rights have not simply been defined and defended by
the law of the state, but also by agreements which were negotiated,
not unilaterally imposed, and which are constitutionally protected.
Co-management is not a separatist or isolationist vision, but one of
cooperation and sharing. These are values not to be dismissed in
today's world. There will always be hostility and resistance from some
quarters. There will always be a need to form [[alliance]]s to protect one's
interests, and co-management can help people to do that. The struggle
continues, but on new and higher ground.

Notes
1. This section is a condensation of Usher, Tough, and Galois [[1992]]. For

a useful legal interpretation of the process of conversion of [[Indian]]
lands to [[Crown]] lands, see Slattery [[1987]]. For a more expanded
discussion, see [[Canada]] [[1996]], especially vol. 2, ch. 2, 'Treaties', and
vol. 2, ch. 4, 'Lands and Resources'.
2. [[Canada]] also acknowledged limited responsibility for dealing with
past failures to honour its [[treaty]] obligations under the Specific
Claims Policy ([[Canada]] [[1982]]), which applied to the [[treaty]] areas.
However, policy implementation has been unilaterally and narrowly determined by [[Canada]]. Loss of use of off-reserve resources,
subsistence or non-market resource values, and resource management issues, are all excluded from consideration.
3. Developments in [[aboriginal]] self-[[government]] are beyond the scope
of this paper, but have also taken two directions. One is the creation
of public [[government]] in territories in which [[aboriginal]] peoples are
the majority ([[Nunavut]] and Nunavik). The other has been to assert
an 'inherent right of self-[[government]]' whose content would be
negotiable or justiciable (which was a part of the unratified
Constitutional proposals of [[1992]]). This discussion focuses entirely
on the regimes established by comprehensive claims and related
processes and does not address the constitutional debates.
4. This and the following sections are based on the results of the
Land, Resource, and Environment Regimes Project undertaken for
the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples, consisting of eight
case studies of contemporary co-management regimes established
by the comprehensive claims process and other circumstances, and
a synthetic analysis (Usher [[1997]]). The entire set of reports is available on CD-ROM (Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples [[1997]]).
