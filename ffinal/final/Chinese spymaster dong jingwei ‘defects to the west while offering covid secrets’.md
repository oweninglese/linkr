# Chinese spymaster Dong Jingwei ‘defects to the West while offering Covid secrets’

A top [[Chinese]] spy has reportedly defected to the US and offered up intelligence about how the [[Covid]] [[pandemic]] began.

Vice Minister of State Security Dong Jingwei is believed to have secretly flown from [[[[Hong]]]] [[[[Kong]]]] to the US on [[February]] 10, according to reports that have surfaced on [[Chinese]] media sites and Twitter.

He travelled alongside his daughter Dong Yang, outlet [Spy Talk](https://www.spytalk.co/p/high-level-chinese-defection-rumored) reported.

Rumours are swirling that Mr Dong has passed on important information about the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology, at the centre of the covid lab leak theory which had been dismissed as a “conspiracy” by many for the last year-and-a-half but is now being reignited.

If the rumours are true, Mr Dong would be the highest-level [[defector]] ever from the People’s Republic of [[China]].

His evidence may have even sparked US [[President]] [Joe Biden](https://www.news.com.au/topics/joe-biden)’s U-turn on the country’s covid probe. Mr Biden announced in late [[May]] a new review into the origins of [covid](https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/two-new-cases-recorded-as-nsw-extends-masks-restrictions/news-story/418e784d06097ff7d0019add6378f3d8), after having shut down a previous probe.

He has now called on the US intelligence community to “redouble” its investigation to find out whether covid jumped from an animal host to humans, or if it was accidentally released from the [[Wuhan]] research lab.

Mr Dong served as a prestigious counterintelligence head of [[China]]’s Ministry of State Security, otherwise known as the Guoanbu. His intelligence is reported to include [early pathogenic studies of the [[virus]]](https://twitter.com/BryanDeanWright/status/1405879302395[[[[2035]]]]87/photo/1), models of predicted covid spread and damage to the world, and financial records detailing which organisations and [[government]]s funded the research.

He may also have information about the names of [[Chinese]] spies working in the US, and how the [[Chinese]] [[government]] gained access to a [[CIA]] communications system.

Former [[Chinese]] foreign ministry official Dr Han Lianchao, who defected after the [[Tiananmen]] [[Square]] massacre in [[1989]], wrote in a tweet this week that if true, Mr Dong’s defection “is really a big [[bomb]]”.

He also reportedly shared a photo of Mr Dong, claiming he was last seen in public in [[September]] [[2020]]. The photo has since been removed from [[Chinese]] search engine Baidu.

With tensions growing between the US and [[China]], some false rumours have recently surfaced about [[defector]]s, including a bogus claim covid scientist Shi Zhengli had swapped sides.

Also adding to the intrigue are reports from [[China]] that Mr Dong hosted a national security meeting on [[June]] 18 aimed at catching “spies and [[traitor]]s”. However, a convincing photo of him at the meeting has not yet surfaced, sparking disbelief that he ever attended the event.

The local reports have actually fired up the rumour mill even more, with a photo from the alleged security meeting showing a man who many believe is not actually My Jingwei.

“That is not a picture of Dong Jingwei,” one Twitter user wrote.

“If #DongJingwei has not defected, why won’t [[Beijing]] show him off in public?” another commented.

“Since nobody, not even the MSS head of counterintelligence, can be in two places (much less two continents) at the same time … somebody’s lying,” a third said. “Where’s #DongJingwei today?

**‘[[China]] needs to be transparent’**

It comes as the head of the [World Health Organisation](https://www.news.com.au/world/asia/who-chief-says-wuhan-covid-lab-leak-theory-cant-be-ruled-out/news-story/f91bd0edaf89dd389d3941e349765187) Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus refused to rule out the [[Wuhan]] lab leak theory at the G7 summit, and called on [[China]] to be more “transparent”.

Dr Tedros said that so far 3.75 million people worldwide had [[died]] from the [[virus]] and at least 174 million were confirmed to have contracted the disease.

“I think the respect these people deserve is knowing what the origin of this [[virus]] is so that we can prevent it from happening again,” he said.

Dr Tedros also suggested there had not been enough “transparency and co-operation” from [[China]] initially.

**‘This must never happen again’**

Speaking on the [[[ABC]]’s](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/insiders/series/0/video/NC2109V020S00) _[Insiders](https://iview.abc.net.au/show/insiders/series/0/video/NC2109V020S00)_program this morning, [[Australia]]’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne declined to comment on the reported defection, instead she also called for [[China]] to be transparent.

“I wouldn’t normally comment on intelligence matters of that nature, but what is very important here is that we do maintain the momentum of this inquiry process,” she said.

“We know that the phase one inquiry had significant limitations in terms of the delay in deploying it, access to information, access to appropriate scientific and medical evidence.

“So we are very determined to work with our partners to ensure that the phase two investigation is able to access the material that it needs, including within [[China]]. That is strongly supported by the G7 itself.

“The most important thing here … absolutely is that this never ever happens again,” she continued. “They are strongly encouraged by many parties … to enable this to be a very clear and comprehensive process.”
