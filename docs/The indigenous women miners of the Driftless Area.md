Lead [[mining]] and the lead rush of the [[1820]]s is a huge part of the cultural 
narrative of [[white]] settlement in southeastern Wisconsin and the nearby parts of 
Minnesota, Illinois, and Iowa known as the Driftless Area. It’s the 
quintessential frontier story: [[white]] [[America]]n men discover a mineral resource 
and flood the area, doing the manly work of [[mining]] while they slowly civilize 
the area for further settlement.
 
But the idea that there was this untapped mineral waiting to be found by 
[[America]]ns is almost entirely wrong. For nearly a century before that, the lead 
mines had been worked with increasing intensity–and not just by [[Indian]]s, but by 
[[Indian]] women specifically.

[[Indigenous]] people had been [[mining]] for lead in small quantities for thousands of 
years, but it was the arrival of the fur [[trade]] and especially the firearms it 
brought that sparked more heavy [[mining]] by Ho-Chunk, Sauk, and Meskwaki people–an
[[America]]n [[trade]]r predicted that in the summer of [[1826]] the Meskwaki would raise 
between 600,000 and 800,000 pounds of lead at one of their key [[mining]] sites. 
Having learned to smelt from early fur [[trade]]rs, they used the mines to make lead
balls for their guns. This had two benefits: it provided an alternative [[trade]] 
good to furs (which could vary greatly in number and quality depending on the 
year), and it lessened their need to purchase musketballs from the [[trade]]rs.
 
This process was highly gendered. The actual creation of ammunition was 
primarily men’s work, but [[mining]] itself was overwhelmingly dominated by women, 
with only a few elderly men participating. [[Indigenous]] women in this area were 
considered to have domain over the farming fields and the [[sugar]] bushes, and the 
mines may have been an extension of this. Like [[sugar]]-making, [[mining]] was probably
a seasonal activity incorporated into the cyclical yearly activities. Women 
would dig square holes and dredge up the rock and ore, then broke up the 
deposits by heating them and dousing them with cold water before smelting the 
lead in furnaces cut into hillsides.
 
Evidence suggests that [[indigenous]] women may have had very strong proprietary 
feelings about the mines. As Creole communities of mostly [[French]] [[Canadian]] and 
mixed-blood people sprang up in the Driftless Area (such as in Prairie du 
Chien), only men who married [[Native]] women were permitted to even see the lead 
mines. One man, Julien Dubuque, was unusually granted permission to work the 
mines after marrying a Meskwaki woman, whose name has unfortunately been lost in
the records. The work of Monsieur and Madame Dubuque expanded the [[mining]] 
operations by encouraging a developing Creole community that bought [[Indian]] lead 
in exchange for [[trade]] goods. According to Ho-Chunk sources, [[indigenous]] miners 
also sold musketballs to other tribes outside the region.
 
After the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[America]]n military established a more permanent 
presence in the region. At first, immigrating [[America]]n men had to follow 
tradition and marry [[indigenous]] women to get involved with [[mining]]. But by the 
late [[1820]]s thousands of [[white]] miners and a smaller number of black miners (both 
free and enslaved) had rushed to the area. The two groups of miners rarely 
mixed, clashing over gender roles, language, and prejudice. Worse, [[white]] men 
engaged in rowdy behavior, and [[indigenous]] women, who had occupied crucial 
positions in society until now, were abused so frequently that [[Indian]] men began 
to try to police them. In Prairie du Chien, the predominately metis society 
passed a law prohibiting “[[white]] persons skulking” around after dark.
 
The [[white]] miners’ abuse of [[Indian]] women, their destruction of [[indigenous]] food 
sources, and their relentless incursions into [[Indian]] territory were major issues
for [[indigenous]] communities by [[1830]]. Meanwhile, changing circumstances meant that
women’s production of lead and maple [[sugar]] were now more central to [[indigenous]] 
economies than the fur [[trade]], leaving men idle and susceptible to drunkenness 
and belligerence. These strains, along with longstanding conflicts over certain 
[[treaties]], contributed to the outbreak of the Black Hawk [[War]] in the [[1830]]s.
 
The war tore apart [[Indian]] communities and increased [[white]] fear and hatred for 
[[Indian]]s, resulting in the policies of removal that were attempted in the next 
few decades. The Sauk and Meskwaki were removed several times to Iowa, Kansas, 
and Oklahoma. Some remained hidden in Iowa until they were allowed to purchase 
their own land in [[1851]], which they still own today as the Meskwaki Settlement. 
The Ho-Chunk were also removed repeatedly, to Minnesota, [[South]] Dakota, and 
Nebraska. Though some still live on the Nebraska reservation today, many 
Ho-Chunk people refused to leave their Wisconsin homeland, even walking back all
the way from Nebraska. Today they have begun to reacquire their land in 
southeastern Wisconsin.
