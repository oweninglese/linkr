title: Opinionthe science suggests a wuhan lab leak
---

The possibility that the [[pandemic]] began with an escape from the [[[[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology]] is attracting fresh attention. [[[[President]] Biden]] has asked the national intelligence community to redouble efforts to investigate.

Much of the public discussion has focused on circumstantial evidence: mysterious illnesses in late [[2019]]; the lab’s work intentionally supercharging [[virus]]es to increase lethality (known as “[[gain of function]]” [[research]]). [[The [[Chinese]] Communist Party]] has been reluctant to release relevant information. Reports based on U.S. intelligence have suggested the lab collaborated on projects with the [[Chinese]] military.

But the most compelling reason to favor the lab leak hypothesis is firmly based in [[[[science]]]]. In particular, consider the genetic fingerprint of #CoV-2, the novel [[corona[[virus]]]] responsible for the disease #[[Covid]]-19. 

In #gain-of-function [[research]], a #microbiologist can increase the lethality of a #[[corona[[virus]]]] enormously by splicing a special sequence into its genome at a prime location. Doing this leaves no trace of manipulation. But it alters the #[[virus]] [[spike protein]], rendering it easier for the [[[[virus]]]] to inject genetic material into the victim cell. Since [[1992]] there have been at least 11 separate [[experiment]]s adding a special sequence to the same location. The end result has always been supercharged [[virus]]es.

A [[genome]] is a blueprint for the factory of a cell to make proteins. The language is made up of three-letter “words,” 64 in total, that represent the 20 different amino acids. For example, there are six different words for the amino acid arginine, the one that is often used in supercharging [[virus]]es. Every cell has a different preference for which word it likes to use most.
