QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH

Mental [[health]] and substance use in an urban First Nations population
in Hamilton, [[Ontario]]

ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES: Mental [[health]] and substance use have been identified as [[health]] priorities currently facing [[Indigenous]] peoples in [[Canada]]; however, accessible
and culturally relevant population [[health]] data for this group are almost non-existent. The aim of the Our Health Counts study was to generate First Nations
adult population [[health]] data in partnership with the De dwa da dehs ney>s [[Aboriginal]] Health Access Centre in Hamilton, [[Ontario]].
METHODS: Analysis involved data gathered through respondent-driven sampling. Prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals were generated for
diagnosis and [[treatment]] of a psychological disorder or [[mental]] illness, depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide, alcohol and
substance use, and access to emotional support.
RESULTS: Of the 554 First Nations [[adults]] who participated in the Our Health Counts study in Hamilton, 42% had been told by a [[health]] care worker that they
had a psychological and/or [[mental]] [[health]] disorder. High rates of depression (39%) and PTSD (34%), as well as suicide ideation (41%) and attempts (51%)
were reported. Half of the sample reported marijuana use in the previous 12 months, and 19% reported the use of cocaine and opiates.
CONCLUSION: First Nations [[adults]] living in Hamilton experience a disproportionate burden of [[mental]] [[health]] and addictions. By working in partnership with
urban [[Aboriginal]] organizations, it is possible to produce policy- and service-relevant data and address the current deficiency in appropriate [[mental]] [[health]] and
substance use services for urban [[Aboriginal]] people.

n [[Canada]], cycles of family disruption, abuse, colonization,
dislocation from traditional lands and outlawing of spiritual
practices among [[Aboriginal]]* peoples have led to many
[[health]] and social inequities.1,2 Rates of suicide, depression and
substance abuse are significantly higher in many [[Aboriginal]]
communities than in the general population.2–4 [[Aboriginal]]
communities and their governing organizations have identified
[[mental]] [[health]] and substance use as [[health]] priorities currently
facing [[Aboriginal]] peoples in [[Canada]]. Currently, however,
accessible and culturally relevant population [[health]] data for
urban [[Aboriginal]] populations are limited. This near absence of
[[health]] assessment data is of concern, given the size and growth
of the [[Aboriginal]] population in [[Canada]] and known [[health]] and
social disparities.2,3,5,6 The aim of this study was to respond to
urban First Nations [[health]] information gaps in order to generate
population-based measures of key [[mental]] [[health]] and substance
use conditions for First Nations people living in Hamilton.
Prevalence rates of specific psychiatric disorders, diagnosed
using culturally validated measures among [[Aboriginal]] people,
are limited. Existing prevalence data are generally unadjusted
* “[[Aboriginal]] peoples” is a collective name for all the original peoples of [[Canada]] and
their descendants. The Constitution Act of [[1982]] specifies that the [[Aboriginal]]
Peoples in [[Canada]] consist of three groups: [[Indian]]s, Inuit and Métis. Globally, no
universal definition of [[Indigenous]] peoples has been accepted. Most definitions of
“[[Indigenous]]” will include reference to the relationships of [[Indigenous]] peoples to
a collective kin group and a current or historic landbase.

and based on service utilization or clinic records, and this
produces underestimates, as many [[Aboriginal]] people do not use
mainstream services.7,8 In addition, there are cultural and
historical differences across [[Indigenous]] populations as well as
methodological challenges associated with measuring and
diagnosing these illnesses.9
These gaps were partially addressed by the development of the
First Nations and Inuit Regional Longitudinal Health Survey
(RHS), a national, population-based sample administered and
governed by the [[Aboriginal]] community, which has generated

MENTAL HEALTH IN URBAN FIRST NATIONS

high-quality and culturally grounded evidence for on-reserve
populations.10 Results from the [[2002]] RHS indicated that 30.1%
of respondents had experienced a time when they felt sad, blue
or depressed for two weeks or more in a row, 30.9% reported
having suicidal thoughts over their lifetime, and 15.8% reported
having attempted suicide at least once in their lifetime.11 In
comparison, the [[Canadian]] Community Health Survey (CCHS),
although it does include off-reserve [[Aboriginal]] populations in
[[Canada]], has a higher response bias and is not administered by
the community. Results from the [[2000]]/[[2001]] CCHS showed that
13.2% of the off-reserve [[Aboriginal]] population had experienced a
major depressive episode in the previous year.12 CCHS data from
Hamilton revealed that 26% of residents reported being limited
by a physical or [[mental]] [[health]] condition.13
Although there are variations across communities,14,15 rates of
suicide among certain First Nations and Inuit communities in
[[Canada]] are high.16 Again, these data must be interpreted with
caution as there are two potentially significant sources of error
that must be considered: first, that suicide [[death]]s are often
under-reported and classified as accidental [[death]]s and, second,
that accurate data on whether a person is “[[Native]]” or “Non[[Native]]” as self-defined or defined by the census are difficult to
collect.17 Elevated rates of suicide and self-harm in [[Aboriginal]]
populations in [[Canada]] and globally have been linked to the
damaging impacts of colonization, including deculturation,
intergenerational trauma and the cumulative effects of [[racism]],
discrimination and the social, economic and political exclusion
experienced by [[Aboriginal]] communities.14,18
Related to the lack of available and [[representative]] data is a need
for more community-centric [[research]] and data systems that build
on the strengths and priorities of [[Aboriginal]] communities, as well
as a need for core involvement of [[Aboriginal]] people in the
planning and implementation of services and programs.19 The
current [[mental]] illness service delivery model has strong
psychiatric and biomedical traditions and focuses largely on
individualized interventions as opposed to a more wholistic,
[[Aboriginal]] model of wellness that involves the physical,
emotional, spiritual and [[mental]] aspects of a person who is
always in connection with his or her community, family and
the natural environment.20,21
Given the almost non-existent population-based data for urban
[[Aboriginal]] people in [[Canada]], the main objective of the Our Health
Counts (OHC) project was to work in partnership with [[Aboriginal]]
stakeholders to generate a culturally relevant, [[representative]]
baseline set of [[health]] data for three urban [[Aboriginal]]
communities in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Respondent driven sampling
(RDS) was selected as the recruitment method for a number of
reasons: it builds on the existing strength of social networks,22
and it allows for the generation of unbiased estimates of a
population’s composition by adjusting for different probabilities
of being sampled and by use of a structured recruitment frame
and a dual incentive process.23,24 The results presented here
pertain specifically to the urban adult First Nations population
in Hamilton, where the organizational project lead was the
[[Ontario]] Federation of [[Indian]] Friendship Centres (OFIFC) and the
community partner was De dwa da dehs ney>s [[Aboriginal]]
Health Access Centre (DAHC).

METHODS
Community-based participatory [[research]]
This study upheld current ethical and scientific standards in
[[indigenous]] [[health]] [[research]].25–28 Data sharing and [[research]]
agreements were established between the academic [[research]]
team, OFIFC and DAHAC. In addition, a Governing Council,
comprising [[representative]]s from the core urban [[Aboriginal]]
provincial organizations, was established to oversee all stages of
the [[research]] process. All members of the Hamilton study team
were from the [[Aboriginal]] community, living in the general
vicinity of the city of Hamilton. Community-based processes for
the OHC project are more fully described elsewhere.29,30 Formal
ethics approval was provided by the [[Research]] Ethics Board of
St. Michael’s Hospital in [[Toronto]].

Study site
The City of Hamilton is located in southern [[Ontario]] on what was
traditionally Haudenosaunee (Iroquoian) territory and is near two
First Nations reserves: Six Nations of the Grand River and
Mississaugas of the [[New]] Credit. According to the census, in [[2006]]
the total [[Aboriginal]] population in Hamilton was 13,735 people,
accounting for 2.8% of the total population of the city.31 The
OFIFC identified the city of Hamilton as a promising
community site on the basis of its significant [[Aboriginal]]
population and strong infrastructure of [[Aboriginal]] community
services.

Recruitment
The RDS process was initiated through the purposive selection of
individuals, also called “seeds”, to begin recruitment. Inclusion
criteria for participation in the study were age of 18 years or
older, residence within the geographic boundaries of the City of
Hamilton and self-identity as First Nations. With the help of
community partners nine seeds were chosen, and they agreed to
participate. In order for seeds to reflect a diverse demographic
perspective of First Nations people living in Hamilton, factors
such as sex, age, family size and occupations were considered in
their selection.
Study participants, including seeds, provided written informed
consent and then completed a [[health]] assessment survey, after
which they received three to five coded coupons to refer a
member of their social network into the study. Following the
holiday closure of DAHC, the number of distributed coupons
per recruit was increased from three to five in order to increase
the rate of recruitment. Participants received a monetary
reimbursement for their time and participation, which consisted
of $20 for completion of the survey and an additional $10
for every eligible person recruited into the study. Study
recruitment and interviews took place in an [[Aboriginal]]
community centre.
For sample size calculation, we assumed 95% confidence
intervals (CI), survey item prevalence ranges from 10% to 75%
and a design effect of 2.32 On the basis of this formula, the OCH
study aimed to recruit 500 First Nations [[adults]] and 250 [[child]]ren.
The data presented here are for the adult sample only.

Sources of data

RESULTS

Community concept mapping was implemented to develop a
community-specific survey for First Nations in Hamilton.33 Data
were collected and compiled using SPSS Data Collection Author.34
We implemented the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale K-10
in order to measure depression and anxiety symptoms among
study participants.35 The K-10 has been used extensively in
population-based studies and is well established as a reliable and
valid tool in diverse contexts,35–37 including [[America]]n [[Indian]]
communities.38 Analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of the
K-10 also support the use of this screening instrument to
appropriately identify likely cases of anxiety and depression.35,37
As indicated by scholars in the field,36 an individual’s total score
can be broken down into four categories: low range (10–15),
moderate range (16–21), high range (22–29) and very high range
(30–50). Those individuals who fall into the high and very
high range would likely receive a diagnosis of anxiety and/or
depression.
In consultation with [[Aboriginal]] community partners, we
selected the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD), a screening
measure for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that has been
empirically validated.39 The PC-PTSD screening tool was
designed to detect PTSD diagnoses in primary care settings by
capturing meaningful, empirically derived symptom clusters
using a 4-item, plain language scale.39 Specifically, First Nations
[[adults]] were asked if they had ever had any experience that was
so frightening, horrible or upsetting that, in the previous month,
they had had nightmares or thought about it when they did not
want to; had tried hard not to think about it or went out of
their way to avoid situations that reminded them of it; had been
constantly on guard, watchful or easily startled; or had felt
numb or detached from others, activities, or their surroundings.
The literature suggests that the results of the PC-PTSD should be
considered positive if a respondent answers “yes” to any three
items; screening and positive cases should then be assessed with
a structured interview for PTSD.39
Alcohol use and suicide measures administered for Our Health
Counts were the same as those used in the both the [[Aboriginal]]
Peoples Survey40 and the RHS,41and had therefore been
previously validated with [[Aboriginal]] populations. Additional
substance use questions were modified from the RHS.
Specifically, self-reported rates of alcohol consumption and
substance misuse in the previous 12 months were investigated, as
well as lifetime injection drug use or needle sharing.

Socio-demographic characteristics
From [[November]] [[2009]] to [[April]] [[2010]], a total of 554 First Nations
[[adults]] were recruited into the study. A description of
recruitment dynamics, RDS processes and data on demographic
and social characteristics of First Nations [[adults]] in Hamilton
was published by Firestone et al.30 Referral trees generated
recruitment chains that were long enough to achieve
“equilibrium”, the point at which the sample composition
becomes stable.43 The data captured people who were [[homeless]],
transient and had low-literacy s[[kill]]s, who are known to be
under-represented in the census.30,44,45 Overall, a high response
rate for survey questions was observed, including sensitive
questions around trauma and suicide. Specifically, for the K-10
scale and the PC-PTSD screen, the response rates were 94% and
97%, and the Cronbach’s alpha values were 0.834 and 0.846
respectively. Such high response rates can be attributed to
the survey tool itself, which reflected the [[health]] priorities of
the community33 and which was administered in a safe and
culturally secure context.

Mental [[health]]
Most First Nations [[adults]] had been told under the age of 35 that
they had a psychological and/or [[mental]] [[health]] disorder and
over half were at that time taking medication (Table 1). When
participants were stratified by age, we found that individuals
aged 35 to 49 years were significantly more likely to be taking
medication than those 18 to 34 years of age (73%, CI 57.4, 82.8 vs.
32.7%, CI 19.8, 46.3.

Depression, anxiety, PTSD and suicide
Scores for the K-10 scale are presented in Table 2. Those individuals
who fell into the high and very high range (39% of First Nations
[[adults]]) would likely receive a diagnosis of anxiety and/or
depression. When we stratified PTSD indicators by sex and age
categories we did not observe any significant differences.
Suicide among close friends or family was highly prevalent, and
40% of First Nations [[adults]] in Hamilton had ever thought about
committing suicide themselves (Table 2). Although sex and age
differences were not statistically significant, there was a strong
trend indicating that individuals between 18 and 34 years were
more likely to have had these thoughts than participants under
18 years of age (52.8%, CI 41.4, 63.9 vs. 32.7%, CI 22.1, 41.9).

Statistical analysis
RDS methods are used to carry out two tasks: to sample a
population and to generate population estimates using methods
of statistical inference. Population-based estimates and CIs were
calculated using the RDS-I enhanced data smoothing estimator
in the custom RDSAT software (version 7.1).42 Where possible,
data were stratified by sex (male and female) and age (18–34
years; 35–49 years; and 50+); statistically significant differences
with non-overlapping CIs are reported. The RDS methodology
anticipates that personal networks are not randomly distributed
and therefore adjusts for small to moderate levels of network
clustering (e.g., people having ties to others like them), in the
form of post-sampling weights.32

Alcohol and substance use
Adjusted self-reported rates of alcohol consumption and substance
use in the previous 12 months are presented in Table 3. In addition
to the [[drugs]] listed, we also asked participants about PCP
(phencyclidine)/Angel Dust, acid/LSD/amphetamines, inhalants
and Ritalin, but the numbers were too small to report.
As an indicator of high-risk behaviour associated with drug use,
we asked participants about needle sharing.

DISCUSSION
The goal of this [[research]] was to work in partnership with
[[Aboriginal]] communities to address the current deficiency in

Close to 40% of First Nations participants scored in the high or
very high range of the K-10 scale and would most likely present
symptoms of clinical anxiety and depression.36 As a comparison,
the results from the [[2008]]/10 RHS among on-reserve and mostly
non-urban First Nations indicated that 48.9% scored in the low
range (0–5), 44.8% scored in the moderate range (6–19) and 6.3%
scored in the high range (20 and higher).41 [[Australia]]’s National

scores from a modified K6 showed convergent validity with selfreported [[mental]] illness and additional stressors, including racial
discrimination, unemployment and separation from family.46,47
In [[Canada]], a recent report highlights the experiences of [[racism]]
among urban [[Indigenous]] populations, who likely have increased
contact with non-[[Indigenous]] people with limited understanding
of the historical and contemporary socio-economic and political
context of the lives of [[Indigenous]] people.48,49 Clearly, there is a
need for further exploration around the urban environment and
related challenges regarding access to housing, a lack of food
security and high levels of [[poverty]] and [[racism]], together with
their impact on [[health]] in urban [[Aboriginal]] populations.
Forced assimilation in [[Canada]] has had a serious impact on
factors such as the identity and [[mental]] [[health]] of [[Aboriginal]]
peoples, as well as on the dynamics and overall structure of
communities, bands and nations.50,51 It must be recognized that
the impacts of historic events and policies on [[mental]] [[health]] and
well-being might have been different for First Nations, Métis and
Inuit, the differences manifesting themselves also between
communities living on and off-reserve. To date, in [[Canada]], no
systemic studies have been conducted in order to generate
comparable population-based PTSD screening data or prevalence
rates among [[Aboriginal]] people.52 Findings from a telephone
survey of close to 3,000 [[Canadian]]s in [[2002]] revealed an estimated
prevalence rate of lifetime PTSD of 9.2%, with a rate of current
(1-month) PTSD of 2.4%.53 Because of variations in screening
tools, sample size, time frame for symptom duration and other
population characteristics, comparison of epidemiological PTSD
data is complicated.53 For First Nations individuals in Hamilton,
we observed that over a third of the population had experienced
past trauma in their lives that was affecting their everyday wellbeing. As presented elsewhere, PTSD may be linked to residential
school attendance, abuse and family [[violence]], family disruption
by [[child]] protection services and transgenerational trauma
related to these and other impacts of colonization.54,55 There is
an urgent need for ongoing screening for PTSD as well as the
development and piloting of new screening and assessment tools
customized to [[Indigenous]]-specific historic and ongoing trauma.
Rates of participants having a close friend or family member
who had committed or attempted suicide, had self-harmed on
purpose and had expressed suicide ideation were high in the
study. Among those who had thought about suicide, 51% had
made an attempt. Comparably, for on-reserve First Nations, the
results from the [[2002]] RHS indicated that 30.9% reported having
had suicidal thoughts over their lifetime, and 15.8% reported
having attempted suicide at least once in their lifetime.11 Issues
surrounding suicide have been identified as a top [[health]]
problem for [[Aboriginal]] people living in cities, and they continue
to be inadequately addressed.56 We also know that the
overwhelming majority of [[Aboriginal]] suicide victims suffer from
[[mental]] [[health]] disorders, and yet there are few agencies that offer
a continuum of [[mental]] [[health]] care designed specifically for
delivery to urban [[Aboriginal]] populations. It is anticipated that
the data gathered through this [[research]] will corroborate and
attest to the need to sustain and enhance existing services and
programs aimed at suicide prevention in urban [[Aboriginal]]
settings.57

There is growing recognition of the co-occurrence of substance
use and [[mental]] [[health]] disorders in non-[[Aboriginal]] and [[Aboriginal]]
populations. However, there is a large knowledge and service gap
for the [[treatment]] of concurrent disorders in this context and an
even greater dearth of evidence for [[Aboriginal]] populations. The
findings presented here are preliminary and descriptive;
however, drug use and associated high risk behaviours among
First Nations individuals may reflect mechanisms by which
people are managing their [[poverty]], stress and [[mental]] [[health]]
issues. More in-depth analysis in the future will help to build our
understanding of these issues, including initiation into drug use,
acquisition of different types of [[drugs]], binge drug use, and risks
and exposure to blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections.
It is important to recognize that in the face of emotional
suffering, First Nations [[adults]] also reported good levels of selfrated [[health]], felt in balance in the physical, [[mental]], emotional
and spiritual aspects of self, and exhibited a strong sense of
cultural identity.29 Resilience and concepts such as enculturation
have been explored as protective factors against substance use,
suicide ideation and suicide attempts, depressive symptoms and
chronic PTSD in [[indigenous]] settings.15,58 Our findings speak to
the importance of culture-based coping mechanisms and [[health]]
services for [[Aboriginal]] people.
There were some limitations to this study. First, RDS cannot
guarantee a random sample of network members, meaning that
there was room for bias with the sampling methodology. Given
multiple assumptions in the sampling process, RDS estimates are
likely to exhibit error; however, there have been few robust
evaluations of RDS to quantify this.59 There is an active
literature on estimation using RDS data,60 and there is debate
regarding the true design effects in RDS surveys.61 Existing
multivariable regression analyses using RDS samples have not
suitably addressed the co-relation between observations and the
unequal sampling probabilities inherent in RDS, therefore we are
reporting prevalence estimates for which methods are better
established. While there may have been some limitations with
self-reporting, particularly around experiences and behaviours
that are stigmatizing or too painful to recall, all interviews were
conducted by members of the community in a safe and neutral
place, and interviewers provided continued assurance of
confidentiality.
Our findings clearly indicate disproportionately high levels of
anxiety and depression, experiences of trauma, self-harm, and
suicide ideation and attempts in an urban First Nations
population in Hamilton. Additionally, the results highlight
problematic drug use and related high-risk behaviour, as well as
challenges to linking individuals to appropriate and accessible
support for these issues. As expressed by key [[Aboriginal]]
stakeholders and community members in Hamilton at our final
dissemination and gathering, these findings are not new or
surprising for the First Nations community,56 However, by
generating population-based [[health]] information where little
previously existed and strengthening community and
organizational partnerships and capacity, communities can be
even more effective in driving change in policy and
programming that will address [[health]] inequities faced by their
people. For example, the results have supplemented the

des populations accessibles et culturellement appropriées sur ce groupe
sont presque inexistantes. L’objet de l’étude Our Health Counts était de
produire des données de santé des populations sur les adultes des Premières
Nations, en partenariat avec le Centre autochtone d’accès aux soins de
santé De dwa da dehs ney>s de Hamilton ([[Ontario]]).
MÉTHODE : Nous avons analysé des données recueillies par
échantillonnage en fonction des répondants. Des estimations de prévalence
et des intervalles de confiance de 95 % ont été générés pour le diagnostic et
le traitement d’un trouble psychologique ou d’une maladie [[mental]]e, la
dépression, l’anxiété, l’état de stress post-traumatique (ESPT), le suicide, la
consommation d’alcool et de substances et l’accès au soutien affectif.
RÉSULTATS : Des 554 adultes des Premières Nations ayant participé à
l’étude Our Health Counts à Hamilton, 42 % avaient été informés par un
travailleur de la santé qu’ils avaient un trouble psychologique et/ou de santé
[[mental]]e. Des taux élevés de dépression (39 %) et d’ESPT (34 %), ainsi que
d’idéation suicidaire (41 %) et de tentatives de suicide (51 %) ont été
déclarés. La moitié de l’échantillon a dit avoir consommé de la marijuana au
cours des 12 mois antérieurs, et 19 % ont dit avoir consommé de la cocaïne
et des opiacés.

RÉSUMÉ

CONCLUSION : Les adultes des Premières Nations vivant à Hamilton
portent un fardeau disproportionné de troubles mentaux et de
toxicomanie. En travaillant en partenariat avec des organismes autochtones
en milieu urbain, il est possible de produire des données utiles pour les
politiques et les services et de répondre au manque actuel de services en
santé [[mental]]e et en toxicomanie pour les Autochtones en milieu urbain.

OBJECTIFS : La santé [[mental]]e et la consommation de substances sont
considérées comme deux enjeux prioritaires pour la santé des peuples
autochtones au [[Canada]] à l’heure actuelle; cependant, les données de santé
