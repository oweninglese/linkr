understanding of the consumers and their expectations for t
action. In this spirit, Philip Kotler defines marketing as th

scious effort to achieve desired exchange outcomes wit

markets," wherein an appreciation of the market in which
change is taking place is central to the process.1 Not surpr
most [[research]] on marketing has a contemporary focus, but
the problems faced by firms today have analogues in the h
experience.
The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company exchanged [[Europe]]an [[trade]] goods for
furs with [[Native]] [[America]]ns over a period that extends from the late
seventeenth through the twentieth century. That experience pro
vides an ideal case study of how a firm with little initial knowledge
of its consumers developed a successful and enduring relationship
with them. The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company received its charter in [[1670]],
allowing it to [[trade]] for furs in the hinterland of Hudson [[Bay]]. Al
though the [[French]] had been trading through [[Quebec]] City and Mon
treal since the early [[1600]]s, the English [[company]] was a new venture
operating in a new area.2 At first, conflict between [[Britain]] and [[France]]

prevented the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company from gaining secure control
of its posts, but with the signing of the [[Treaty]] of Utrecht in [[1713]] the

hinterland of Hudson [[Bay]] was defined as [[British]], and the Company
began to [[trade]] actively.
During the eighteenth century, the expanding fur [[trade]] reflected

the growth of the [[Europe]]an hatting and felting industries, which
were primarily based on beaver pelts. Although beaver could be found
in many parts of [[North]] [[America]], the highest quality pelts came from

the drainage basin of Hudson [[Bay]], where only [[Native]] [[America]]ns
hunted and trapped beaver; [[Indian]]s thus were the primary agents in
a market bartering furs for [[Europe]]an commodities. Through this pro
cess [[Indian]]s gained access to goods—both producer and consumer—
previously unknown. We focus on the marketing of goods by the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company and the role played by [[Native]] [[trade]]rs in de
ter[[mining]] the quality and selection of goods made available for pur
chase.

The extensive data set preserved in the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's
archives provides a detailed view of the interaction between those
who were supplying [[Europe]]an goods and those who were supplying
the furs. The [[trade]] accounts, letters, and other correspondence be
tween the trading posts and the head office suggest that the Hudson's

[[Bay]] Company was committed to learning about its consumers and to
offering goods that were most in demand. They began by providing
goods similar to those in the more easterly [[trade]], but they also exper
imented with goods that [[Indian]]s had not yet seen. The records reveal
that the [[Native]] [[America]]ns in the region were demanding consumers,
concerned not only with the quantity of the goods they received but
also with their quality and variety. In a world where neither side
was in a position to coerce the other, [[Native]]s' preferences played a
major role in the conduct of the [[trade]].
Our argument is both similar to and very different from that found
in the extant literature. We are not the first to examine the role of
[[Indian]]s as consumers in the fur [[trade]]. The seminal work on the sub

ject is that of E. E. Rich, "Trade Habits and Economic Motivation
among the [[Indian]]s of [[North]] [[America]]."3 Rich argued that, because
[[Indian]]s did not have a [[Europe]]an sense of [[property]], the fur [[trade]]
could not be motivated in the same way it was in [[Europe]]. In other
work, we too have suggested that limited [[property]] rights in [[Native]]
[[America]]n societies had a major impact on the conduct of the [[trade]]
by inhibiting conservation of the fur-bearing animals that served as
the [[trade]]'s basis.4 The lack of [[property]] rights applied, however,

mainly to the animal resources, not to the [[Europe]]an goods that
[[Native]] [[trade]]rs were receiving in exchange. Thus the more durable
items—guns, kettles, and blankets—were regarded as the [[property]] of
the household that purchased them, and the nondurables that came
to play an increasingly important role in the [[trade]]—[[tobacco]] and
brandy—were consumed directly. The ethic of generosity among
[[Native]] groups may have affected their view of the goods they were
receiving, but overall the correspondence of the Company reveals
[[Native]] [[trade]]rs as consumers whose personal preferences played the
overriding role in the composition of the [[Europe]]an [[trade]] goods pre
sented to them.

Rich also argues that [[Native]]s had backward-bending supply curves
of labor: concerned only to achieve a target income, they actually

argued that this view of the trading environment—which i
flected in the work of Karl Polanyi, Arthur Ray, and Shepar
III—is not consistent with the evidence.5 Rather, when pri
[[Indian]]s increased their efforts in the fur [[trade]], which allowed them

to increase their consumption, particularly of luxury goods.6

From the start, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was aware that it was
working in an unknown cultural environment, and one of its goals
was to learn about the reactions of [[Native]] [[trade]]rs to price and other
dimensions of the [[trade]]. In essence, this is the problem facing any
multinational; success depends on the ability to breach the cultural
divide. As James Axtell has argued, "[[Indian]]s no less than the colo
nists had a right to acquire new tastes, to form new aesthetic prefer

ences, .... And they exercised it."7 We believe that the Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company traversed the cultural divide successfully because it
was willing both to incorporate [[Native]] trading traditions and to lis
ten to its consumers.

The Trade at York Factory; A Brief History

Soon after receiving its charter, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company estab
lished several trading posts; Rupert's House on the eastern side of
James [[Bay]] in [[1671]], followed in quick succession by Fort Albany on
the Albany River, and Moose Factory on the Moose and Abitibi Riv
ers (see map). The [[French]], operating along the St. Lawrence from
Montreal, quite naturally saw the Company as a potential threat, and

their reaction in [[1686]] was to capture Fort Albany and Rupert's

House, although both posts were returned in [[1693]]. Despite the con
flict and uncertainty, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company maintained its
foothold in the region and gradually expanded its trading area. In
[[1684]] the Company established Port Nelson, later renamed York Fac

mote trading posts were not physically secure from [[French]] incur
sion. It was only after the [[Treaty]] of Utrecht was signed in [[1713]] and
the drainage basin of Hudson [[Bay]] was declared English that the im
mediate risk of military conquest ended. The economic rivalry with
the [[French]] continued, however, until their rule in [[Canada]] ended in

[[1763]]. English and [[Scottish]] merchants operating from Montreal also
offered competition until the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company and [[North]]west
Company merged in [[1821]]. Our analysis here focuses on the [[trade]]
through York Factory to [[1770]].
Company policy in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] during this period has

been described as vigilant but passive, because Company [[trade]]rs
waited for the [[Indian]]s to come down the rivers to the [[Bay]] rather than
physically going out in pursuit of furs. Because each river-mouth fort

commanded a different hinterland, a roughly radial trading pattern
developed. The [[French]], in contrast, moved directly into the interior
from their base along the St. Lawrence. Their [[trade]] can better be de

scribed as linear, with voyageurs continually pushing farthe

search of new sources of supply.
York Factory, located on Hudson [[Bay]] at the mouth of the

River, was by far the largest of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company'

posts. From [[1713]] to [[1738]] it faced little competition, but in
[[1730]]8 [[French]] [[trade]]rs began to move into the hinterland of

tory, establishing their own trading posts and interceptin

groups en route to the [[Bay]]. Because the Hudson's [[Bay]] C

faced competition during only the second half of the perio

here, we can explore the impact of this competition on
pany's marketing and trading strategies.

During the eighteenth century, York Factory served a hin
of nearly one million square kilometers.8 In [[1720]] the weste

tories of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, from James [[Bay]] to th

ters of the Churchill River, were controlled by Algonquian
[[Cree]] bands, while in the lands along the southwestern bou

two [[Cree]] allies held sway: the Siouan-speaking Assiniboine
Algonquian-speaking Ojibwa.9 [[Native]] populations in the reg

groups that occupied the York Factory trading hinterland
that [[Western]] [[Cree]] numbered 4,500; [[North]]ern Ojibwa, 1
Plains Assiniboine, 2,700. It is likely that existing estimate
ased downward, because they are drawn primarily from rep
the latter part of the eighteenth century and, in the case
Ojibwa, from the early nineteenth century.10 The size of th
groups coming down to the [[Bay]] ranged from small bands
groups, and decisions concerning who would come down to

ing." The unit of account used by the Company at all its posts was
the Made Beaver—the price of a prime beaver skin, either parchment
(a pelt from a freshly caught animal) or coat (a pelt that the [[Indian]]s
had worn); all values were expressed in Made Beaver (MB), a unit of
account easily understood by those coming to [[trade]].12 The Official
Standard, or the list price, gave the official rate of exchange for [[trade]]

goods and furs expressed in Made Beaver; it was used for purposes
of accounting and as a guide to [[company]] factors rather than as a rigid

price list. Post factors were permitted, indeed encouraged, to [[trade]]
at more favorable rates, both to cover the expenses required by the
ceremonial nature of the [[trade]] and to generate additional income for
the Company. As a result, the actual trading of furs for goods took
place at a rate referred to as the post factor's Comparative Standard,
which typically exchanged [[Europe]]an goods at prices higher than the
official list price.13 The amount resulting from the difference between

these two rates was called the Overplus, and all factors had to pro
vide a very close accounting of this number.14 In addition, expenses
incurred in the form of gifts presented to [[Native]] [[trade]]rs during the
ceremonies that preceded the actual trading offset the Overplus. The
construction of accounts that included this separate accounting for
gifts, and other Company actions such as the giving of ceremonial
uniforms to the trading captains, mirrors the ritual nature of [[Indian]]
ceremonies.

The accounting system valued both [[Europe]]an goods and furs in
this unit of account. For example, in [[1730]], the Official value of goods
11. Arthur J. Ray and [[Donald]] Freeman, "Give Us Good Measure": An Eco
nomic Analysis of Relations between the [[Indian]]s and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
before [[1763]] ([[Toronto]], [[1978]]), were perhaps the first to provide a clear description
of Hudson's [[Bay]] Company accounting practices. See particularly chaps. 6 and 7.
12. These pelts are also known as castor sec and castor gras. See Carlos and
Lewis, "[[Indian]]s, the Beaver and the [[Bay]]." The Official price of prime beaver pelts
(coat or parchment) was 1 MB, smaller or inferior beaver pelts were 1/2 MB, mar
ten were 1/3 MB, and all other furs were assigned prices based on the size and
quality of the pelt.

13. There is not generally a record of Comparative Standard by item. There
may have been more of an effect on goods amenable to division, such as gunpow
der or cloth, but there appears to have been no systematic relationship between
the type of good (producer, household, luxury—as listed in Tables 1 and 2) and
the size of the mark-up. It seems, then, and Ray and Freeman made this point,
that although the mark-ups varied by year, the relative prices of [[Europe]]an goods
stayed much the same. See Ray and Freeman, "Give Us Good Measure," 268-70.
14. The accounts were one of the main ways in which the head office could
audit the activities of their post factors and ensure that they were not cheating
the Company. For further discussion of this issue, see Ann M. Carlos and Steven
Nicholas, "Agency Problems in the Early Chartered Companies: The Case of the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company," Journal of Economic History 12 ([[1990]]): 853-57. For a
more extended discussion of Hudson [[Bay]] Company accounting, see Carlos and
Lewis, "Trade, Consumption, and the [[Native]] Economy," 1047.

grouped into a few broad categories: producer goods, household
goods, alcohol and [[tobacco]], and other luxuries. Some of these com
modities, among them kettles, guns, and blankets, came in different
sizes and weights, and the jewelry items came in a wide range of
types. Even ignoring the variations within commodity definition, In
dian [[trade]]rs in a typical year could select among sixty to seventy
different goods.18

We have defined producer goods as those used mainly for hunting
game.19 Guns and related supplies dominated the producer goods
category, accounting for 70 to 80 percent of goods in this group in
terms of value. Before [[1720]] [[Native]]s spent more than 60 percent of

18. We can compare these commodities to the list provided by Kathryn E.
Holland Braund, Deerskins and Duffels: The [[Cree]]k [[Indian]] Trade with Anglo

[[America]], [[1685]]-[[1815]] (Lincoln, Nebr., [[1993]]), 130, for the southern [[Cree]]k [[trade]].

Economy," producer goods played little part in the hunting of fur-bearing ani
mals. High-quality pelts were destroyed if full of shot holes.

their income from the fur [[trade]] on producer goods. During the [[1720]]s

and through the [[1730]]s, however, the share fell to between 40 and 50
percent; and starting in the early [[1740]]s and continuing to [[1770]], the
producer goods share declined to about 30 percent of expenditures
(see Figure 1). Guns came to play a less important role in demand.
This change in consumption over the period does not reflect the gun
merely as a durable item that did not need frequent replacement,
because the quantity of powder and shot also declined. In fact, in
the harsh local [[climate]], guns were not that durable.20

The household goods category contains those commodities used
most directly in food preparation and for warmth. Kettles and blan

kets predominated, with awls and fire steels being minor items.21

20. As Michael Bellesiles documents clearly in Arming [[America]]: The Origins
of a National Gun Culture ([[New]] York, [[2000]]), guns in this period were unreliable.
21. There is, of course, the possibility of overlap between categories. We could

as easily place knives and needles in the household category as well as in the
producer goods category.

Over the same period, the household goods share in expendi
declined, from about 10 percent to just over 5 percent (see F
The decline in the producer and household goods shares of
expenditure was offset by an increase in the share of expen

what we term luxury items (see Figure 3). To refine further th

of expenditures on these goods, we have broken them into thre

categories: [[tobacco]] and related items, alcohol and related ite

other luxury goods, including beads, cloth, jewelry, and Ve
among a long list of goods (see Table 2).

For much of the period, the most important luxury goo
chased by [[Indian]]s was [[tobacco]]. There were a few large year[[flu]]ctuations, but for the most part, [[tobacco]] consumption a
of total expenditure remained in the 15-20 percent range. O
same period, the share of expenditure on alcohol increased
albeit from an extremely low level. Indeed, in the early pe
alcohol was received in [[trade]] (though it was consumed dur
ritual portion of trading), and until [[1730]] it remained a relat

nor item, with a share of about 5 percent. With the rise in fur

after [[1738]], however, the share of expenditures on alcohol i
markedly, equaling or surpassing that for [[tobacco]] from 175

end of the period.22 The increase in [[tobacco]] and alcohol ex
mirrors the phenomenon noted by Carole Shammas for

peoples: "Probably the most striking development in cons
ing during the early modern period was the mass adopti

English and the colonials of certain non-[[Europe]]an grocerie
[[tobacco]], tea, [[sugar]], and rum.22

The issue of alcohol consumption has been presented in
ature as a negative in[[flu]]ence. Comparison of the role of
the Hudson [[Bay]] hinterland with its role in other areas is d
the absence of more extensive [[trade]] data, but the literatur

[[America]]n [[trade]] intimates the trading of vast quantities an
some [[Native]] groups as so addicted that they would [[trade]]
for alcohol.24 Kathryn Braund and James Axtell, for exam

ment on the harmful effects of alcohol, reporting that [[Indian]]
to drink to total inebriation and when drunk to commit antisocial
acts.25

In [[1740]], before there was significant [[French]] [[trade]] in the area, In
dian [[trade]]rs received from the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company a total of 450
gallons of alcohol, equaling 0.05 gallons per capita, sufficient for at
most five 2-ounce drinks per person for all [[Indian]]s living in the York

Factory hinterland.26 At its peak, and allowing for alcohol received
from the [[French]], actual annual consumption per person was perhaps
double this estimate. Certainly, alcohol was a major component of
the gift-giving ceremonies, but it accounted for only 20 to 30 percent

of the Company's costs for gift items (see Table 3).27 Even if one nar
rows consumers to the 5 percent of the [[Indian]] population who were

directly involved in the brandy [[trade]], the number of drinks per per
son among this group would have risen at most from one hundred

alcohol consumption.

to two hundred over the period."8 John McCusker's estimates of an
nual per capita consumption for a number of groups during the sev
enteenth and eighteenth centuries provide a basis for comparison.

Gin consumption alone in England in the mid-[[1650]]s was 0.02 gal
lons per capita; in the [[1740]]s English per capita alcohol consumption
increased to 1.40 gallons, and the ration for [[British]] soldiers in the

Caribbean in the [[1760]]s and [[1770]]s was 22.75 gallons per capita.29 In
deed, during these decades, "even the sick poor in St. Bartholomew's
hospital were entitled to three pints of beer a day, as well as an un
specified amount of ale."30 Even allowing for consumption of much
of the brandy in situ, the comparisons provided here do not suggest
that [[Native]] [[trade]]rs were drinking more heavily than other contempo
rary populations.
More important, as is evident in Table 2, brandy was not an espe
cially important part of the [[trade]]. Indeed, for much of the period,
goods that have been much less studied dwarfed brandy in quan
tity.31 Until the late [[1740]]s alcohol amounted to less than 10 percent
of the total value of goods received, and in most years was less than
half the [[trade]] in [[tobacco]]. Fine Brazilian [[tobacco]] made up between
15 and 20 percent of [[Native]] expenditure throughout the period.32 The
value of [[tobacco]] consumed was more than double that of alcohol

until the [[1740]]s, in part because the type of [[tobacco]] being sold to
the [[Indian]]s by the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was the most expensive
available. Shipped from Brazil to Lisbon, where the Company bought
through agents, it was then sent on to London for re-export to the
[[Bay]]. In [[1737]], for example, the directors wrote to Messrs. Mawman,
Bearie, and Macy that "the last [[tobacco]] proved very good and there
fore desire this year may be as near that quality and size as you can
but not larger twist nor any inferior quality." When in [[1738]] they

Among the wide variety of luxury goods that also gained

cloth, in fact, exceeded those of alcohol through much of th

about 15 percent in the early years to almost 30 percent by

35. How important alcohol and the other [[Europe]]an goods were relative to to
tal [[Native]] consumption is necessarily a matter of speculation, but we can suggest
orders of magnitude. In [[Western]] [[Europe]], before [[1700]], typical households allo
cated about 80 percent of their income to food; and in late eighteenth-century
Philadelphia, the minimal maintenance of indentured servants was roughly 80
percent of their total compensation. See Carlo M. Cipolla, Before the Industrial
Revolution: [[Europe]]an Society and Economy, 1000-[[1700]], 2d ed. ([[New]] York, [[1980]]),

30; and Farley Grubb, "The Auction of Redemptionist Servants, Philadelphia,
[[1771]]-[[1804]]: An Economic Analysis," Journal of Economic History 48 ([[1988]]): 588.
If at least this share of [[Native]] income went to supplying subsistence, then Euro
pean luxury goods could have accounted for no more than 20 percent, likely less
because [[Native]]s produced some luxuries directly. Because at its peak alcohol was
about 25 percent of [[Europe]]an luxury good consumption, alcohol could have com
prised no more than 5 percent of the total [[Native]] consumption basket, and gener
ally much less than that. Tobacco's share might have been 5 percent throughout

the period, whereas estimates for other luxury goods are as follows: cloth and
gartering, 2-3 percent; beads, 0.2 percent; vermillion, 0.2 percent, and other items

generally been taken as a given.36 Yet the changes in consumption
patterns evident in the York Factory data force questions about the
nature of the goods presented for purchase. While the [[trade]] data de
scribe the quantitative changes that were occurring, the correspon
dence between the head office and managers at the posts illustrates
the thinking of the Company with regard to marketing strategy and,

relating to that, the role played by [[Native]] [[trade]]rs in the choices that

were being made about the quality and types of goods being sent to
the [[Bay]].

Marketing to [[Native]] [[America]]ns: Language
A feature of the long-distance [[trade]]s that has received very little
comment is the frequency with which buyers and sellers spoke dif
ferent languages. In some cases a barter [[trade]] can take place by rely
ing on gestures or a basic pidgin; but the range of goods sold by the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, and the elaborate trading processes and ac
[[company]]ing rituals, speak of a complex market relationship that
evolved over many years. Hudson's [[Bay]] Company managers would
have spoken early modern English, while [[Native]] [[America]]ns coming
to York Factory spoke Algonquian [[Cree]]. As languages go, English
morphology is relatively simple, especially in comparison to [[Native]]

[[America]]n languages, which are very complex.37 In the repeated
transactions that were to occur, the way in which the Company ap

proached communication with the [[Native]] [[America]]ns reflects the
Company's view of the [[Indian]]s as consumers.
The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company entered the fur [[trade]] with the inten
tion of being a repeat actor. Despite the early wars with [[France]], it
built posts around the coastline of Hudson [[Bay]]—Fort Albany, East
main, York Factory, and Fort Churchill. The Company hired salaried
managers to act on its behalf, and in other work we have argued that,

through the use of positive incentives such as efficiency wages and
gratuities, and through the close monitoring of accounts, the Com
pany was effective in reducing the level of its managers' opportun

teenth Century," in Old Trails and [[New]] Directions: Papers of the Third [[North]]
[[America]]n Fur Trade Conference, ed. Carol M. Judd and Arthur J. Ray ([[Toronto]],
[[1980]]), 255-71, has also examined this question. As he correctly points out, even
though iron was considered a technology superior to bone and wood, it was not
nearly as easy to repair a broken metal implement. At issue is not just a crude
comparison of two technologies, but how that new technology would conform to
the needs of those using it.

end of the eighteenth century, many of the Company's ma
factors and managers came from this group.

This letter, written during a time of instability around
[[Bay]], indicates that Company directors in London clearly rec
a need to have managers who could communicate with the

ers. They were sending to Hudson [[Bay]] 14-year-old boys wh

learn not only the [[trade]] but also the language. The Company

different [[Native]] [[trade]]rs coming down to the [[Bay]], it becom
ent why the Company had a greater incentive to invest in t
munication s[[kill]]s than the [[Indian]]s.

One of these Christ Church boys was Henry Kelsey, who became
a distinguished explorer and [[trade]]r. Apprenticed in [[1684]], by [[1700]]
Kelsey had not only mastered [[Cree]] but had also prepared a [[Cree]] dic
tionary, which he sent back to London. E. E. Rich, the preeminent
historian of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, argues that Kelsey, with his
knowledge of [[Cree]] and his interest in expanding the Company's abil
ity to communicate with [[Native]] [[trade]]rs, had much to do with the
loyalty of the [[Cree]] to the English in this period. By [[1702]], the Com
pany had printed multiple copies of Kelsey's dictionary and sent
them back to its posts along the [[Bay]].39

Kelsey was also involved in the organized teaching of [[Cree]]. Rich
notes that the Company's motivation was to enable its officials to
travel in the interior, but such knowledge was also important in the

trading process itself.40 Through the [[1720]]s, although the Company
seemed to be somewhat less interested in exploration, all its [[trade]]rs
were required to learn [[Cree]]. By [[1750]], when the [[French]] were moving

west of Lake Superior and the Company had built Flamborough
House, one of its few posts away from the [[Bay]], [[Cree]] was the predom
inant language of the [[trade]]. Rich describes the new master of Flam

borough House, Samuel Skrimshire, as "an unsteady man, lazy and
unfit for forwarding any business,. . . but. . . he was competent in the

[[Cree]] tongue."41 Indeed, the [[French]] choice of a route to the Rockies
through [[Saskatchewan]] rather than Missouri occurred not only be

cause of the ease of canoe travel, but also because the voyageurs
could use [[Cree]] along the entire route.42

The Company's concern with language continued throughout the

century. Andrew Graham's Observations on Hudson's [[Bay]] was a
very important book within the naturalist community in England.
Graham, who was a post factor in the [[1760]]s, continued a tradition
started by Kelsey, including in his Observations dictionaries of a va
riety of [[Native]] tongues, which he represented phonetically for Euro
pean use as Kelsey had.43 It was not until the [[1840]]s that a proper
[[Cree]] syllabary was created. James Evans, a Wesleyan missionary
working at Norway House in the York Factory hinterland, created a
syllabary for Ojibwa partly based on Pitman shorthand in [[1820]] and
adapted this for [[Cree]] twenty years later. This syllabary is still in use.

So, though we do not know just how factors and [[trade]]rs communi
cated, we do know that the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company encouraged and
supported [[Native]]-language acquisition on the part of its agents at the
[[Bay]].

Marketing to [[Native]] [[America]]ns:

The Quality Dimension
The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company account books document the changing
structure of the [[trade]] as consumption shifted from producer and
household goods into luxury goods. The [[trade]] did more than just
present [[Native]] [[America]]ns with an Iron Age technology; it also meant
access to textiles, blankets, lace, thimbles, mirrors, alcohol, and to
bacco.44 One of the most striking features of the letters exchanged

between the post factors and the head office in London, as

the letters from the directors of the Company to their factors,

evidence they contain of the vital role played by [[Native]] tr
deter[[mining]] both the types and the quality of the commod

vided. Even though they might have journeyed several

miles to engage in [[trade]], [[Indian]] [[trade]]rs were not willing t

just any commodity that the Company chose to send over to its

there for the best satisfaction of the [[Indian]]s, And wee will do

utmost that you shall be supplied with every species of Comm
ity in perfection.45

Thus, very early on, the head office was aware that the Co
[[trade]] goods had to meet the standards of the [[Indian]]s, and th

tions between post managers and [[Native]] [[trade]]rs quickly bec
mechanism used to ensure that the commodities sent were satisfac

tory.46 In [[1697]], for example, the London directors asked its post man

agers to let them know of "any failure in any of the guns and whose
they were and any other commodity."47 Two years later the official
letter to the [[Bay]] expressed the same desire to know about the quality
of the guns sent: "And hope these guns will prove good, or which
pray advice, and note the name and make of those that proves other
wise."48 In [[1717]], the directors wrote that

we notice what you write as to the guns sent you last year that
they were not so good as those you carried with you and are apt

to believe what you write too true, but hope those we now send
you will prove otherwise for we have taken particular care therein

49

Yet, despite these assurances, the head office was still writing in
[[1724]] that "we have taken care to send you this year good guns if not
better than ever were sent into the country," and nine years later the
official letter to the factories noted that the Company had "taken the

utmost care that all the goods now sent you should be according to
your directions and as near the samples as was possible."50 Six years

later the directors wrote, "[W]e observe that the powder, cloth,
knives and hatchets proved bad and that the natives are very curious

in choosing goods especially the iron work. . . . [W]e shall take care
to have all the hatchets viewed and those with any breaks or flaws
thrown out."51

Metal goods—guns, hatchets, knives, ice chisels, scrapers—were
an important component of the [[trade]], especially in the first half of
our period, and the quality of these goods was, as noted, a major
trading issue. Although the assurances made by the head office take
on a rhetorical bent when seen year after year, there was, in fact, a
serious underlying problem that did take many years to understand.

The properties of metal in temperate [[climate]]s and in extreme condi
tions are not the same. Metal products are prone to severe structural

weaknesses during extreme winter conditions. In addition, water
that gets into cracks can cause frost wedging. So guns could burst
when fired and hatchets break.52

The [[Indian]]s quickly realized that flaws of any sort led to problems
and were very choosy about the metal products they purchased. In
deed, although the head office often asked about the type of handles
and the color of the wood, but post factor James Knight wrote back,
"I have never knowd the [[Indian]]s stand much upon the handles so
the blades were but good." And in the same letter he continued: "I
very seldom see that there is any manner of notice taken as ye colour

of ye stocks so the lock and barrell is good and well stocked, and
[the] sett of some for light colourd others for Dark is as their fancy
deads."53
It is clear from the letters between the head office and York Fac
tory that it took many years to understand the nature of the problem.

308 CARLOS AND LEWIS

Only in [[1730]] does a letter from Thomas Macklish, chief fa
York Factory, make it clear that the factors understood the
the metal failures:

We have sent home samples of several goods as is most taken with
the natives. . . and earnestly entreat your honours that all hatchets
sent may be clear of cracks and flaws, for the natives will not [[trade]]
them unless they are necessitated, for whatever crack is in the eye
of the hatchet, and come to strike upon the said hatchet in winter
time, it surely breaks to pieces and is of no further use to the Indi
ans, for the extremity of the frost tries all ironwork, which we daily
find by experience at the factory.54

The directors had pursued a number of different strategies to deal

with the metal failures, including, as noted, purchasing more expen
sive guns. Of course, the directors had to make the vendors under

stand what happened to their products in northern [[climate]]s, a pro

cess that took many years. In addition, given that the problem
seemed to lie in Hudson [[Bay]], the Company sent out an armorer to
each post, one of whose jobs it was to examine all guns on arrival at
the factory to ensure that they met the required specifications and to

repair guns when possible, whether new or used. The Company also

had some metal products made at the [[Bay]] posts. That tactic pro
duced its own difficulties, however: in [[1728]] Macklish had to ask the

Company to send out better bar iron so that the smith could make
ice chisels and scrapers without cracks and flaws. By [[1742]] the York
Factory daily post journal notes that one of the major activities of
the smith during the winter was to make scrapers and bayonets for
the [[trade]].55

Given the preoccupation with metal products that can occur, it is
important to note that concern over quality applied equally to all
goods supplied in [[trade]]. This is made clear in [[1739]] when the chief
factor at York Factory responded to the head office letter of the previ

ous year, which asked him to explain the "[[Indian]]s dislike of particu
lar goods, their refusal and the reason for the same, to the best of

our knowledge." James Isham lists nineteen items, including these
excerpts:
1. Beads large pearl, the [[Indian]]s dislikes for the colour, both large
and heavy, the shape not being for the use they put them to ... so
being few or none [[trade]]d ... I send them home.

2. Kettles they complain of, for their being small for the weight, of

a very bad shape, the handles hanging over the side too far, the

and of too large a grain; they finding when they put a little in their

as thick as packthread in some places and as thin as thread in other
places, and of a small size. . . .
18. Rings is too wide, the generality of the female sex having small
fingers.

Isham went on to note that he had "sent home samples of the most

part which is pleasing to [[Indian]]s, and most conducive to your hon
ours' interest."56

The body of correspondence between the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company

posts and the head office in London documents both [[Indian]] reluc
tance to purchase commodities that they considered inferior and the
Company's continuous efforts to provide [[trade]] items with the correct
attributes. In trying to decide on the correct attributes, the head office

continuously required the post factors to send samples and explicit
descriptions of the goods most desired. The problem facing the Com
pany on the quality dimension was compounded when [[French]] trad
ers moved into the York Factory hinterland. As Arthur Ray has
noted, [[Native]] [[trade]]rs were quick to take advantage of the new situa
tion. As early as [[1728]], even before the [[French]] had penetrated the
area, the factor at York Factory wrote, "Never was any man so up
braided with our Powder, Kettles and Hatchets, than we have been
this summer by all the [[Native]]s, Especially by those that border near
the [[French]]."57 By the end of the [[1730]]s, [[French]] [[trade]]rs had begun to

set up posts within the drainage basin of York Factory (see map).

Quality issues now became confounded by issues of compet
[[1737]] the directors wrote,

We are informed that the powder, cloth, knives and hatchets
out from England] are not so acceptable to the [[Indian]]s as the
sort of commodities as are sent from [[France]], and therefore ord

that you make a strict observation wherein the difference co
between our's and theirs and send us your reasons both from
selves and what you learn from the [[Indian]]s why the one is pr
ble to the other . . . and send samples.58

In response to samples sent, the directors stated that they h

received the two pieces of cloth and the sample of other k
you sent us which you say are [[French]], the worst piece is
course and loose and narrow and not near so good or bro

what we have formerly and do now send, and therefore we d
pect you will write us the reasons why the [[Indian]]s like the Fr
better than ours which you have omitted to do. . . ,"59

Competition wrought changes in the structure of the tra

dian [[trade]]rs played English off against [[French]]. The first im
a change in the prices paid for furs at the [[Bay]] posts. The pr
rose from roughly the 70 that had prevailed until the mid-

115 by the mid-[[1750]]s. On the [[Indian]] side, this increase in
was in part responsible for the shift in expenditures towa
luxury goods.60 On the Company side, there was now more
ing about the nature of faults in the products. By the end
[[1740]]s, for example, the head office argued that a combina
harsh [[climate]] and improper use were perhaps at the base of
problem:
Upon exa[[mining]] strictly into the complaints made of the guns we
find it is chiefly the [[Indian]]s own faults by not putting dry and
proper woods in when they charge them and by firing them when

the muzzle is stopped with snow which will burst the best gun
that can be made, but as to the flaws we have given such strict
orders that we hope you will hear no further complaints in that
head, but if upon the armourers exa[[mining]] the guns now first any
are found so defective as to be unsaleable send them home.61

[[Indian]] Consumers and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company 311

In [[1752]] the directors were highly critical of a post factor who re
turned four guns as defective: "[W]e think its very extraordinary after
having wrote you so fully last year on that head, the defects that you

condemn them for are only fire flaws," which always happen. The
following year they told the factors, "[0]n no account send home any
whose only defects are a few small fire flaws," arguing that these fire
flaws were not "any real defect but a mark of their hardness."62

Throughout the period examined here, the directors were con
cerned with the quality not only of the major [[trade]] items, but also of

those goods that made up a small fraction of the [[trade]]. With regard
to jewelry and other luxury items, the issue was quality and which
varieties would have the greatest appeal. Beads, for example, came
in many colors, sizes, and shapes and were the subject of a great deal
of correspondence despite being a relatively minor [[trade]] item.63 In

[[1718]] the general letter noted, "[A]s to ye large purple and small
[[white]] beads, there are none to be had in England, but hope another
year to furnish you with both."64 Buttons—their material, color, size,

and shape—generated a similar degree of concern, with the Com
pany asking, for example, whether the "coat and waistcoat buttons,
whether solid or hollow, pewter or other metal" were in the correct
sizes.65 As with the more significant [[trade]] items, products that did
not meet the proper specifications simply could not be sold: "a good
quantity of unsizable [[white]] Beads sent 3 years ago by reason your
Honours could not procure at that time those that were sizable as I
am informed. Be pleased to order them home for they will never be
[[trade]]d here."66

Concern about beads continues throughout the period. In the
[[1750]]s the directors sent out some new varieties with evocative

names: [[white]] barley [[corn]], red flower black barley [[corn]], round [[white]]
with double flowers in red and green, and new sorts of [[China]] beads.
As the directors note, these beads "from their scarcity are at an ex

cessive high price."67 This translated into an Official price of six
Made Beaver per pound. In comparison, a blanket cost seven Made
Beaver. Again, as with metal products, the presence of [[French]] com

"Trade, Consumption, and the [[Native]] Economy," 1053-54. The fact that so much
of the Company's correspondence is about beads may help explain why this mi
nor [[trade]] good plays such a disproportionate role in some of the historical litera
ture dealing with [[Native]]s and the fur [[trade]].

petition brought a questioning of post policies. In [[1762]] the d
wrote:

[T]he large long beads returned are so triviall a quantity we think
it very strange they could not be [[trade]]d by mixing a very few at a
time among the others, which would very speedily have exhausted

them, and ought to be the constant practice in trading with the
[[Native]]s, in order to get rid of every article from which they are
about to withdraw their regard, and if not adhered to will from the
fickle disposition of the [[Indian]]s constantly leave a large quantity
of various kinds of useless goods in the Factory. One thing certain
to be depended on is that as we never buy any goods but what we
intend to be the best of their kinds, so neither will we, unless mis
led, purchase any species, but what shall be most agreeable to the
[[Native]]s for [[trade]].68

Thus, as they had in regard to metal products, the London directo

were by the [[1760]]s arguing that the goods sent out were of high qu
ity and that over the decades they had improved in both durabilit

and quality.69 This letter also emphasizes that the directors' know
edge of the [[trade]] came from the demands of the [[Indian]]s and comm
nication with the post factors. At the same time, the letter reveal
that these communications were becoming more tense.

Marketing to [[Native]] [[America]]ns: [[New]] Commodities

In creating a [[trade]] in furs with [[Native]] [[America]]ns, the Hudson's B
Company had to provide goods with the proper specifications. As
result, [[Indian]] [[trade]]rs were able to buy guns, hatchets, cloth, kettle
knives, and twine better suited to their environment and needs. At

the same time, the head office was always in search of new goods
that would entice more [[Indian]]s or more furs or specific furs in for
[[trade]] at the posts. Throughout the period discussed here, the London

directors sent out samples of goods that they hoped would find a
market and, to the extent that there was a demand, instructions about

specific items for which the "new goods" might be [[trade]]d. Thus,
these new commodities had the dual purpose of attracting more
[[trade]] and, when possible, of generating [[trade]] in particular pelts, such
as parchment beaver or martins, that were in high demand on the
London market.

[[Indian]] Consumers and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company 313

The first evidence of such an attempt comes in [[1697]] when the
directors wrote to ask the factors "if you could persuade the [[Indian]]s
to weare our Sheepe Skins drest with the wooll which maybe usefull
to keepe them warm Wee could supply you yearely at a reasonable
price."70 The directors' goal was to try to reduce the amount of coat
beaver—pelts worn by the [[Indian]]s for a number of seasons—brought
to the posts, because its price in London was declining.71 Two years
later, the London committee noted that they "were sorry the [[Indian]]s

will not approve our Sheepe Skins."72 Nevertheless, in [[1702]] they re
quested that factors try to persuade the [[Indian]]s to wear cloth in order

to lessen the quantity of coat beaver brought to the posts. But this
too failed.73

In [[1712]] the directors sent out some brass "handcuffs" (bracelets)
that would [[trade]] only for martins and at a price of four martins per
pair. The handcuffs never sold—not because the [[Indian]]s did not use
them, but rather because they manufactured their own. When re

quested by the London committee to buy back old kettles, the chief
factor at York Factory answered that he could not do so because the
[[Indian]]s "always converted them into fine handcuffs and pouches
which is of greater value with them then twice the price of the ket
tles."74 Despite these failures, the Company continued its strategy of

[[testing]] new commodities. The letter of [[1732]] notes, "[Y]ou will find

by the Invoice a dozen silk handkerchiefs and one doz of trunks
which we send you by way of trial to see how [[Indian]]s like them and
would have you rate them. . . the handkerchiefs at one and a half
beaver each and the trunks at two beaver each."75 As can be seen in

Table 2, there was a demand for both of these items, especially for
trunks.

With the movement of [[French]] [[trade]]rs into the region, the directors

tried to use such new goods as a way to gain market share:
Having received great encouragement from York Fort to send them
a quantity of brass collars which being represented to us as very
pleasing to the [[Native]]s and much to our interest by encouraging
the [[Indian]]s to leave the [[French]], from whom they have some of the

as a shawl over other items of apparel.

most inferior sort made of iron, we have thought it necessary
send you a dozen of two sizes finely polished to try and make
[[experiment]] how far you can improve the [[trade]] in them with
natives to our advantage . . . and have settled the standard at
beaver per collar.76

Unfortunately, unlike the trunks, brass collars did not sell
years later, the factories were told that "since the brass co
not esteemed by the [[Indian]]s according to their value we de

would dispose of them in the best manner you can."77 In 1

Despite the occasional failures described here, a whole ra
luxury items (see Table 2) did sell and in fact grew as a
[[Indian]] expenditure: beads, combs, magnifying glasses, lookin
or mirrors, sashes, scissors, thimbles, and shoes. Although
commodities mirror the inventories of [[Europe]]an and coloni
holds alike, no argument is being made here that [[Native]] Am
used these commodities in the same ways. Indeed, the Com
failure to sell brass collars, earrings, and sheepskins speaks
to the independence of [[Native]] consumers.

Conclusions

The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was a trading [[company]]. Its very exis
tence depended on its ability to supply those commodities that
would entice [[Native]] [[trade]]rs to its posts. Indeed, during the period
examined here, [[Indian]] [[trade]]rs were not only freely coming down to
York Factory, but most were journeying long distances to engage in
[[trade]]. Despite the long journeys, the [[trade]]rs would not buy goods
that failed to meet their specifications or interests.
The directors in London used the [[trade]] indents or accounts and

the reports of the salaried managers to determine which commodi
ties sold. Company managers learned [[Cree]] to help with their market
ing and, from the correspondence, it is apparent that treating the In
dians with respect was viewed as of paramount importance. Not only
did the directors try to provide commodities that met the required
specifications through use of samples and descriptions provided by
the post factors, but the Company continually sent out new goods to
"see if the [[Indian]]s liked them." The rejection of some of these goods

speaks only to the independence of [[Native]] consumers—it was their
preferences that were paramount in deter[[mining]] which goods the
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company shipped to [[Bay]]side posts. The evidence con
firms that [[Indian]]s were not only participating in the consumer revo
lution through the quantity of goods they were buying; they were
also including variety and quality in their calculations as key dimen
sions of their consumption decisions, and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Com
pany responded to these dimensions.
