## 3.1. Introduction

## US and [[Canadian]] border security measures all too often ignore the

## concerns of [[North]] [[America]]n [[indigenous]] peoples. In borderlands regions,

## and especially for affected native populations, border security without

## cross-border stability and cultural continuity can mean no security at all.

## A broad observance of the letter and spirit of a little known, yet significant,

## [[treaty]] negotiated between the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Great]] [[Britain]] in [[1794]]

## could change this paradigm.

## [[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]]^2 ([[ABC]]s) enjoy access to the

## [[United]] [[States]] unrestricted by the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),

## a right stemming from the Jay [[Treaty]] ([[1794]]).^3 An examination of this

## right, now codified at § 289 of the INA, reveals qualifying [[ABC]]s are

## entitled to privileges unparalleled by all but [[United]] [[States]] citizens to enter

## and remain in the US ‘for the purpose of employment, study, retirement,

## investing, and/or immigration’^4 or any other reason.

## This chapter outlines the [[history]] and development of the Jay [[Treaty]],

## the rights of [[ABC]]s today and the scope of [[ABC]] status. It analyses the lack

## of reciprocity in [[Canada]] and explores the issues of cross-border mobility

## and commerce. It provides illustrations of these issues through case law,

#### and as applied in the [[Arctic]] region. It concludes by submitting that active

#### engagement of [[indigenous]] communities on cross-border mobility issues is

#### crucial to the ongoing development of sound border security and policy.

## 3.2. History

#### Long before [[Europe]]an contact, travel across what is now the US/[[Canada]]

#### border was an element of daily life for the people of numerous [[North]]

#### [[America]]n [[indigenous]] nations. The international boundary was established

#### by [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the US in the Peace of Paris, which divided [[North]]

#### [[America]] without regard for its [[indigenous]] nations.^5 The [[indigenous]]

#### peoples resented a boundary passing through territory that had been

#### theirs since time immemorial and viewed the newly established border as

#### an infringement on their sovereign rights.

#### In [[1794]], to address issues unresolved by the Peace of Paris or arising

#### thereafter, [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the US negotiated the Jay [[Treaty]]. As part of

#### this [[treaty]], the parties sought to relieve tribal tensions arising from the

#### imposition of the new boundary.^6 In relevant part, Article III of the [[Treaty]]

#### provides:

#### ‘It is agreed that it shall at all Times be free to His Majesty’s Subjects,

#### and to the Citizens of the [[United]] [[States]], and also to the [[Indian]]s

#### dwelling on either side of the said Boundary Line freely to pass

#### and repass by land or inland navigation, into the respective

#### [[Territories]] and Countries of the Two Parties on the Continent of

#### [[America]] (the Country within the Limits of the Hudson [[Bay]] Company

#### only excepted)...’

#### The Jay [[Treaty]] did not create a new right for the continent’s [[indigenous]]

#### people; rather, it recognised their pre-existing right to move freely

#### across the land.^7 In [[1796]], an explanatory provision was added to the

#### [[treaty]] providing that no further [[treaties]] should derogate from the rights

#### guaranteed by Article III.^8 During the [[War]] of [[1812]], Jay [[Treaty]] rights were

#### suspended. The Supreme Court of the [[United]] [[States]] has held that the [[War]]

#### of [[1812]] abrogated the Jay [[Treaty]] and that, following the war, the [[Treaty]]

#### of Ghent revived the rights of native tribes predating that conflict.^9 ,^10

#### The US continued to recognise the right of [[indigenous]] people to

#### pass across the border freely until enactment of the Immigration Act

#### of [[1924]] (Act of [[1924]]), which provided for only those eligible for

#### citizenship to enter the US.^11 Because [[indigenous]] people were ineligible

###### Jay tREaty aND CRoss-boRDER MobiLity aND sECuRity 37

#### for citizenship as a result of race-restricted naturalisation laws dating to

#### [[1790]],^12 the Act of [[1924]] barred their entry to the US.^13 Shortly thereafter,

#### the US [[government]] used this as a basis to deport [[ABC]]s who had not

#### registered as aliens or obtained immigrant visas.^14

#### In the [[1927]] McCandless case, an [[ABC]] named Paul Diabo was

#### arrested and ordered deported for entering the US in violation of US

#### immigration laws. He challenged his deportation, based on the Jay

#### [[Treaty]].^15 In defence of its position, the [[government]] argued that the [[War]]

#### of [[1812]] abrogated the Jay [[Treaty]], relying on the general principle that

#### war between nations ends all prior [[treaty]] rights, and those rights are

#### only reborn if a new [[treaty]] provides them.^16 ,^17 On appeal, the Court found

#### in favour of Diabo.^18 It reasoned that [[treaties]] stipulating permanent

#### rights, professing to aim at perpetuity, do not end upon occurrence of

#### war, but are merely suspended until the war ends and revived when

#### peace returns.^19 Because Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] grants the right to

#### freely cross the border in perpetuity, the right is permanent in character;

#### thus, the [[War]] of [[1812]] did not abrogate the Jay [[Treaty]].^20 Further, in [[1815]],

#### the US and [[Great]] [[Britain]] signed the [[Treaty]] of Ghent, which again

#### recognised the [[Indian]]s’ prerogative to move freely across the border,

#### removing any doubt as to the existence of that right.^21

## 3.3. Scope: A Determination based on Racial

## Considerations

#### [[Congress]] codified the [[Indian]]s’ right of free passage across the border

#### with the Act of 2 [[April]] [[1928]] (Act of [[1928]]):

#### ‘\[T\]he Immigration Act of [[1924]] shall not be construed to apply to

#### the right of [[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]] to pass the borders

#### of the [[United]] [[States]]: Provided, That this right shall not extend to

#### persons whose membership in [[Indian]] tribes or families is created

#### by adoption.’^22

#### This provision remained in effect until [[1952]], when [[Congress]] enacted the

#### INA. INA § 289 modified the language of the Act of [[1928]] by replacing

#### the adoption provision with a bloodline requirement – the only racial

#### metric in US immigration law:

#### ‘Nothing in this title shall be construed to affect the right of

#### [[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]] to pass the borders of the [[United]]

###### This content downloaded from 192.30.202.8 on Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:25:54 UTC

###### 38 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC

#### [[States]], but such right shall extend only to persons who possess at

#### least 50 per centum of blood of the [[America]]n [[Indian]] race.’^23

#### With no legislative [[history]] on point, the basis for bloodline requirement

#### is unclear, but it is reasonable to assume it stemmed from then recent

#### case law and statutory definitions of ‘[[Indian]]’ outside of the immigration

#### context. In the [[1947]] opinion US ex rel. Goodwin v. Karnuth , a federal

#### district court analysed the term ‘[[Indian]]’.^24 After noting the term was not

#### defined in [[United]] [[States]] Code (USC) sections dealing with immigration,

#### the Court looked to other sections of the Code defining the term. It

#### noted the definition of ‘[[Indian]]’ used in 25 USC Chapter 14, which governs

#### an array of issues pertaining to [[Indian]] peoples and land: ‘The term

#### “[[Indian]]” as used in \[this Act\] shall include all persons of [[Indian]] descent

#### who are members of any recognized [[Indian]] tribe now under Federal

#### jurisdiction... and shall further include all other persons of one-half or more

#### [[Indian]] blood .’^25

#### The Court then cited the canon of statutory interpretation that

#### ‘[[Congress]] may well be supposed to have used language in accordance

#### with the common understanding’,^26 and that ‘\[t\]he popular or received

#### import of words furnishes the general rule for the interpretation of

#### public laws’.^27

#### Applying this canon, the court determined that ‘the words

#### “[[America]]n [[Indian]]s born in [[Canada]]”, found in \[the Act of [[1928]]\] must be

#### given a racial \[rather than political\] connotation.’^28 It then addressed

#### the second clause, which read: ‘Provided, That this right shall not extend

#### to persons whose membership in [[Indian]] tribes or families is created

#### by adoption.’^29 The court reasoned that inclusion of the second clause

#### ‘means that such adoption does not make the adoptee an [[America]]n

#### [[Indian]] by “blood”, entitling him to free entry under the first clause. One

#### whom nature has not made an [[America]]n [[Indian]] cannot be made one by

#### adoption in some [[Indian]] tribe or family.’^30

#### This opinion and the statutory definition of ‘[[Indian]]’ interpreted in

#### Goodwin were published after the Act of [[1928]] (which did not contain

#### a blood quantum requirement) and prior to the [[1952]] enactment of the

#### INA (which did). Although there is no definitive legislative [[history]] on

#### the matter, the drafters of INA § 289 likely knew of this reasoning

#### when they removed the adoption language from the Act of [[1928]] and

#### expressly replaced it with the blood quantum requirement. Beyond this,

#### [[Congress]]ional reasoning for retaining the racial basis for [[ABC]] classification

#### remains unclear.^31

## 3.4. [[Canada]]

### 3.4.1. [[indigenous]] groups in [[Canada]]: [[indian]], inuit,

### Métis and métis

#### Section 35(1) of the [[Canadian]] Constitution names three separate

#### [[indigenous]] cultural groups under the umbrella term ‘[[Aboriginal]]’ for the

#### purposes of [[Canada]]’s constitution:^32 [[Indian]],^33 Inuit and Métis.^34 In this

#### context, the term ‘[[Indian]]’ is therefore used in a distinct way from Inuit

#### and Métis. The question then remains whether the Inuit and Métis

#### peoples are eligible for [[ABC]] status.

#### While the Inuit do not self-identify as [[Indian]]s, and [[Canada]] expressly

#### distinguishes Inuit from [[Indian]]s, as far as the US is concerned, [[Canadian]]-

#### born Inuit are eligible for rights under INA § 289 upon establishment

#### of the requisite blood quantum.^35 ,^36 The US does not rely on [[Canadian]]

#### definitions in deter[[mining]] which groups qualify for the benefits of INA

#### § 289,^37 and US courts have held that the term ‘[[Indian]]’ includes Inuit.^38

#### An examination of the statutory language introduced both prior to and in

#### the INA indicates a clear intent to broaden the applicability of Jay [[Treaty]]

#### rights beyond only those individuals who are members of [[Indian]] tribes.^39

#### Because Inuit are [[Indian]]s as far as the US [[government]] is concerned, Inuit

#### peoples born in [[Canada]] who possess the bloodline requirement may

#### qualify for [[ABC]] status.

#### Like the Inuit, Métis do not self-identify as [[Indian]]s and are distin-

#### guished as a separate [[indigenous]] group from [[Indian]]s in Section 35 of

#### [[Canada]]’s Constitution.^40 The term ‘métis’ originates from a [[French]]

#### word meaning ‘mixed’ and was historically used in [[Canadian]] [[French]]

#### for persons of mixed ancestry.^41 While ‘métis’ generically denotes mixed

#### [[indigenous]] ancestry,^42 when capitalised, the term refers to a specific

#### population of [[indigenous]] and [[French]]-[[Canadian]] origin which emerged

#### from the marriages which took place in the early 19th century between

#### [[French]]-[[Canadian]] fur [[trade]]rs and local [[indigenous]] people.^43 The Métis

#### maintain a strong and unique identity, with specific criteria dictating

#### membership within the community.^44

#### Meanwhile, the question of whether Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s^45

#### are ‘[[Indian]]s’ under Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]], has long

#### been the subject of legal debate. Section 91(24) is the provision of

#### [[Canada]]’s Constitution through which the federal [[government]] of [[Canada]]

#### derives jurisdiction over the subject matter of ‘[[Indian]]s, and Lands reserved

#### for the [[Indian]]s’.^46 In [[2013]], a Federal Court ruled in Daniels v. [[Canada]]

###### This content downloaded from 192.30.202.8 on Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:25:54 UTC

###### 40 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC

#### that both Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s are included as [[Indian]]s ‘within the

#### meaning of the expression “[[Indian]]s and Lands reserved for the [[Indian]]s”

#### contained in s. 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]].’^47 On 17 [[April]] 2[[014]],

#### the Federal Court of Appeal upheld that decision in part: it ruled that

#### only Métis, and not non-status [[Indian]]s, are included as [[Indian]]s within

#### the meaning of the [[Canadian]] Constitution.^48 But on 14 [[April]] [[2016]], the

#### Supreme Court of [[Canada]] (SCC) unanimously restored the ruling of

#### the Federal trial court, which held both Métis and non-status [[Indian]]s

#### are ‘[[Indian]]s’ for the purpose of section 91(24) of the Constitution

#### Act, [[1867]].^49 In its decision, the Court clarified that the term ‘[[Indian]]’ or

#### ‘[[Indian]]s’ in [[Canada]]’s constitutional context has two meanings: ‘a broad

#### meaning, as used in s. 91(24), that includes both Métis and Inuit and

#### can be equated with the term “[[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]]” used in s. 35,

#### and a narrower meaning that distinguishes [[Indian]] bands from other

#### [[Aboriginal]] peoples.’^50

#### The definition of [[ABC]] is contingent only on birth as a [[Canadian]]

#### citizen and satisfaction of the requisite blood quantum. Métis identi-

#### fication alone is insufficient to qualify for [[ABC]] status; an individual must

#### satisfy the bloodline requirement, a matter independent from Métis

#### identity. The same rule applies to métis. For this reason, while the recent

#### ruling of the SCC has significant implications for the rights of Métis and

#### non-status [[Indian]]s in [[Canada]], it has no bearing on their qualifications for

#### [[ABC]] status. Ultimately, for INA § 289, whether individuals are [[Indian]],

#### Inuit, Métis or métis, they will qualify for [[ABC]] status if they were born in

#### [[Canada]] and can satisfy the bloodline requirement.

### 3.4.2. No Reciprocal Right to Enter [[Canada]]

#### The SCC decisions regarding the validity of Jay [[Treaty]] rights have been

#### informed by the fact that the [[Canadian]] Parliament has never enacted

#### enabling legislation required for the Jay [[Treaty]] to have force of law in

#### [[Canada]].^51 ,^52 Thus, the [[Canadian]] [[government]] holds that the Jay [[Treaty]]

#### does not affect the admissibility of US-born [[indigenous]] persons to

#### [[Canada]].^53 Admissibility of all non-citizens to [[Canada]] is governed by the

#### Immigration and Refugee Protection Act,^54 which does not incorporate

#### Jay [[Treaty]] rights. The [[Canadian]] Immigration Act states that ‘every person

#### registered as an [[Indian]] under the [[Indian]] Act has the right to enter

#### and remain in [[Canada]] in accordance with this act, and an officer shall

#### allow the person to enter [[Canada]] if satisfied following an examination

#### on their entry that the person is a... registered [[Indian]]’. However, the

#### registration requirements of the [[Indian]] Act have proven difficult, and

###### Jay tREaty aND CRoss-boRDER MobiLity aND sECuRity 41

#### [[Canadian]] courts have declined to broaden its applicability; thus, US-born

#### [[indigenous]] persons are not extended a reciprocal right of entry to [[Canada]]

#### under the Jay [[Treaty]].

#### In [[1956]], the SCC in Francis v. The [[Queen]]^55 unanimously held that

#### a [[treaty]] such as the Jay [[Treaty]] is not enforceable in [[Canada]] without

#### enabling legislation.^56 While [[Canada]] does not recognise a reciprocal

#### right of entry for US-born [[indigenous]] persons, [[Canadian]] courts

#### have recognised and protected an [[aboriginal]] right to freely pass the

#### border.^57 This right is protected by [[Canada]]’s Constitution in Part II of

#### the Constitution Act, [[1982]] (Constitution Act).^58 Section 35(1) of the

#### Constitution Act recognises and affirms ‘the existing [[aboriginal]] and

#### [[treaty]] rights of the [[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]]’.^59 Section 35(2) defines

#### ‘[[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Canada]]’ to include the [[Indian]], Inuit and Métis

#### peoples of [[Canada]].^60 While [[Canadian]] courts have declined to recognise

#### Jay [[Treaty]] rights as existing [[treaty]] rights under Section 35, it is within

#### Section 35 that [[Canadian]] courts find authority to recognise existing

#### [[aboriginal]] rights.

#### In [[1990]], the SCC decided R. v. Sparrow , analysing the rights

#### of [[aboriginal]] peoples in light of Section 35.^61 The Court held that

#### Section 35(1) should be given a generous and liberal interpretation in

#### favour of [[aboriginal]] peoples, that the [[government]] cannot extinguish

#### an [[aboriginal]] right without a clear intention to do so, and that the

#### [[government]] may regulate or infringe on such rights only if the inter-

#### ference meets the test for justification laid out by the Court.^62 It established

#### four factors to analysing a claim under Section 35(1): (1) ‘whether an

#### applicant has demonstrated that he or she was acting pursuant to an

#### [[aboriginal]] right’; (2) ‘whether that right was extinguished prior to the

#### enactment of s. 35(1)’; (3) ‘whether that right has been infringed’; and

#### (4) ‘whether that infringement was justified’.^63 This test continues to be

#### employed by the SCC when analysing 35(1) claims.

#### In the [[1996]] case of R. v. Van der Peet, the SCC analysed the

#### substantive rights recognised and affirmed by Section 35(1).^64 The Court

#### described Section 35(1) as ‘the constitutional framework through

#### which the fact that [[aboriginal]]s lived on the land in distinctive societies,

#### with their own practices, customs and traditions, is acknowledged and

#### reconciled with the [[sovereignty]] of the [[Crown]].’^65 The Van der Peet Court

#### articulated a test for identifying [[aboriginal]] rights – the ‘integral to a

#### distinctive culture test’. It directs that ‘in order to be an [[aboriginal]]

#### right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition

#### integral to the distinctive culture of the [[aboriginal]] group claiming the

#### right’.^66 To qualify, the ‘practice, custom or tradition must be of central

###### This content downloaded from 192.30.202.8 on Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:25:54 UTC

###### 42 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC

#### significance to the [[aboriginal]] society in question – one of the things which

#### made the culture of the society distinctive’.^67 The Court concluded that

#### [[aboriginal]] rights must be based on those that existed prior to contact

#### with [[Europe]]an society.^68

#### Watt v. Liebelt^69 raised the question of whether ‘it could be contrary

#### to an existing [[Aboriginal]] right of an [[Aboriginal]] people of [[Canada]], as

#### guaranteed in the Constitution, for an [[Aboriginal]] person who is \[an

#### [[America]]n citizen\], and neither a [[Canadian]] citizen nor registered under

#### the [[Indian]] Act of [[Canada]], to be ordered to depart from [[Canada]] for a

#### crime committed \[in [[Canada]]\]’.^70 While the Court of Appeal did not

#### ultimately reach a decision on the issue, it quashed the order of deportation

#### and remanded the case for further fact-finding on the tests previously

#### established in Sparrow and Van der Peet.

#### Recently, the case of R. v. Desautel^71 again raised the issue of whether

#### a US-born [[indigenous]] person not resident in [[Canada]] may assert an

#### [[aboriginal]] right to enter [[Canada]], and the court found they could. The

#### appellant was Richard ‘Rick’ Desautel, a member of the US-based Lakes

#### Tribe of the Colville Confederated Tribes (‘Lakes Tribe’) and a resident

#### and citizen of the [[United]] [[States]]. The Lakes Tribe is a successor group of

#### the Sinixt people, whose traditional territory extends both north and

#### south of what is now the US-[[Canada]] border. In [[2016]], Desautel asserted

#### an [[aboriginal]] right to hunt for ceremonial purposes by shooting and

#### [[kill]]ing an elk in traditional Sinixt territory in [[Canada]]. He was charged

#### with hunting without a licence, and hunting big game while not being a

#### resident of [[British]] Columbia, contrary to the Province’s Wildlife Act.^72

#### In his defence before the [[British]] Columbia Provincial Court,

#### Desautel asserted his actions were protected by Section 35. In opposition

#### to Desautel’s claim, the Province argued 1) an [[aboriginal]] group must

#### reside in [[Canada]] to be considered an [[aboriginal]] people protected by

#### Section 35 in [[Canada]], and 2) Desautel’s claimed hunting right is incom-

#### patible with [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]].^73 The court acquitted Desautel of the

#### charges. It found he was exercising an [[aboriginal]] right of the Sinixt/Lake

#### People to which Section 35 protections applied, and that the relevant

#### sections of the Wildlife Act unjustifiably infringe this right.^74 The Province

#### appealed to the [[British]] Columbia Supreme Court,^75 which again found

#### for Desautel.^76 The Province’s subsequent request to appeal the matter to

#### the [[British]] Columbia Court of Appeal (BCCA) was granted, and after

#### considering the arguments of the parties, the court again sided with

#### Desautel.^77 At the deadline for finalising this chapter and forwarding it to

#### its publisher, it is unknown whether the Province will seek leave to appeal

#### the BCCA decision to the Supreme Court of [[Canada]].

#### Another recent case has drawn much-needed public attention to

#### the issue of cross-border mobility for US-born [[indigenous]] persons seeking

#### access to their traditional lands in what is now [[Canada]]. Dr Mique’l

#### Dangeli is a US-born member of Tsimshian Nation. Her people’s

#### traditional territory spans the border between [[Alaska]] (US) and northern

#### [[British]] Columbia ([[Canada]]). As one of the few remaining [[flu]]ent speakers

#### of Sm’algya̱x, the Tsimshian language, she moved to [[Canada]] to teach

#### Sm’algya̱x in her community’s traditional territory, but after ongoing

#### complications with [[Canadian]] immigration, she was forced to leave

#### [[Canada]] after her post-graduate work visa expired.^78 While she was later

#### able to secure the right to work in [[Canada]] through an employment visa

#### based on her status as a professor, she continues her fight for her right to

#### live and work in her traditional territory as an [[indigenous]] person. She

#### has started a petition calling on the [[Canadian]] [[government]] to reciprocate

#### the Jay [[Treaty]], which eloquently states the issue:

#### ‘The colonial border between the US and [[Canada]] dissects

#### [[Indigenous]] territories in ways that sever the lifelines between First

#### Nation families, communities, languages and ceremonies. Every

#### year thousands of US-born First Nations people who are [[Indigenous]]

#### to [[Canada]] are denied the ability to live and work in [[Canada]] because

#### the [[government]] refuses to recognize their ancestral rights to do so.

#### Yet through the Jay [[Treaty]], the relatives of these same people who

#### are born in [[Canada]] and have [[Indian]] Status can live and work in the

#### US. How is it possible that the US, with its extreme policies against

#### immigration, honours the rights of [[Indigenous]] peoples regardless

#### of citizenship and [[Canada]] does not?’^79

#### The rights of [[ABC]]s are firmly settled in the US under INA § 289, rooted

#### in the Jay [[Treaty]]. As the foregoing discussion suggests, there is no

#### reciprocal Jay [[Treaty]] right for US-born [[indigenous]] persons to enter

#### [[Canada]], and the rights of US-born [[indigenous]] persons under [[Canadian]]

#### law are still evolving. The conclusion of this chapter includes a discussion

#### of continuing developments in this regard.

## 3.5. An Exploration of the Jay [[Treaty]] in the

#### The Jay [[Treaty]] provisions drafted to relieve tribal tensions originally

###### 44 THE NORTH AMERICAN ARCTIC

#### now the mainland US-[[Canada]] border. As security measures have moved

#### to the forefront of modern concern, the Jay [[Treaty]] has become diminished.

#### In the 21st century, native populations face a variety of cross-border

#### mobility challenges:

#### ‘\[S\]ecurity has meant increased difficulty in pursuing intertribal

#### [[trade]] and exchange, greater obstacles to delivery of social and

#### [[health]] services to tribal members who live across national borders

#### and the attenuation of social and kinship networks... \[B\]arriers to

#### border mobility undercut efforts to keep alive or re-create cultural

#### traditions and practices that native leaders claim are critically

#### important to the identities and well-being of their members.’^80

#### These concerns transcend the 49th Parallel – they extend across the

#### [[North]]ern Borderlands: along the [[Alaska]] (US)/[[Canada]] border and across

#### the [[Arctic]] region.^81

### 3.5.1. the [[arctic]]

#### The [[Arctic]] region is home to over 500,000 [[indigenous]] peoples^82 spanning

#### 40 ethnic groups.^83 The [[Arctic]] settlement area is divided between eight

#### countries: [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]], [[Russia]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], Norway,

#### Iceland and [[Denmark]].^84 In [[1996]], the [[Arctic]] Council was created ‘with

#### the purpose of advancing circumpolar cooperation. The mandate of the

#### Council is to protect the [[Arctic]] environment and promote the economies

#### and the social and cultural well-being of northern peoples’.^85 The Council

#### consists of the eight above-mentioned [[Arctic]] [[States]], along with six

#### [[Indigenous]] Peoples Organisations representing [[indigenous]] interests,

#### the intent being ‘to engage [[Arctic]] [[indigenous]] peoples in the cooperation

#### in recognition of their right to be consulted in any issues concerning the

#### stewardship of their ancestral homelands’.^86

#### Although those ancestral homelands are now divided by interna-

#### tional boundaries, ‘the [[indigenous]] peoples of the [[Arctic]] view themselves

#### as having a historical existence and identity that is separate and

#### independent of the states now enveloping them’^87 – a claim to [[sovereignty]]

#### at the heart of the Jay [[Treaty]]’s intent. While each distinctive cultural

#### group in the [[Arctic]] has its own unique issues and experiences, one major

#### common challenge faced across these communities is cross-border

#### mobility and the Jay [[Treaty]].

#### It is noted that a Desautel fact pattern could easily arise in the

#### [[Arctic]], where subsistence hunting remains a reality of daily life for many

#### communities. In the most remote areas, the border is still unmarked

#### and a hunting trip across an unmonitored boundary line may only

#### become known to the hunter upon review of their GPS coordinates at

#### the end of the day. A US-born [[indigenous]] person engaged in hunting

#### of migratory species such as caribou, whose migration routes crisscross

#### the border, could easily trigger charges like those currently faced by

#### Desautel should their hunting cross into [[Canada]]. Regardless of who

#### prevails should the Desautel case reach the Supreme Court of [[Canada]], as

#### development in the [[Arctic]] continues to impact natural resources

#### and animal populations, it is only a matter of time before both the US

#### and [[Canada]] begin to monitor hunting and fishing in this region with

#### heightened scrutiny.

#### For brevity, this chapter will focus on exploring the issue of

#### cross-border mobility in the [[Arctic]] as applied to the Inuit, the most

#### northerly of the [[Arctic]] peoples.

### 3.5.2. a Case study: the inuit

#### ‘We Eskimo are an international community sharing common

#### language, culture, and a common land along the [[Arctic]] coast of

#### Siberia, [[Alaska]], [[Canada]] and Greenland. Although not a nation-

#### state, as a people, we do constitute a nation.’^88

#### As introduced in Section 3.4.1., the Inuit are not [[Indian]]s; however,

#### they may qualify for [[ABC]] status upon establishment of the requisite

#### bloodline. There are nearly 60,000 individuals who identify as Inuit

#### in [[Canada]],^89 and approximately 15,700 Inuit living in [[Alaska]].^90 A

#### discussion regarding the right of free passage for Inuit is not confined

#### by the borders of the US and [[Canada]]. Inuit traditional lands span across

#### the circumpolar region in the US, [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], Greenland and

#### [[Russia]].^91 In [[1977]], the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) was founded to

#### ‘speak with a united voice on issues of common concern and combine

#### their energies and talents towards protecting and promoting their way

#### of life’.^92

#### In its first conference that same year, Inuit from [[Canada]], Greenland

#### and the US ([[Alaska]]) discussed this common vision,^93 proposing the

#### right of free travel across traditional Inuit lands of the circumpolar

#### region. The conference presented Resolution 77–13, which ‘call\[ed\]

#### upon [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Denmark]] to provide for free and

#### unrestricted movement for all Inuit across their [[Arctic]] homeland’.^94

#### Resolution 77–13 was rooted in the rights bestowed by the Jay [[Treaty]],

#### and also referenced the concept of [[aboriginal]] rights, then yet to be

#### recognised by the Supreme Court of [[Canada]]:

#### WHEREAS, a [[treaty]] negotiated between the [[United]] [[States]] and

#### England provides intercourse and commerce across the U.S./[[Canadian]]

#### border ; and

#### WHEREAS, we Inuit are the [[indigenous]] people of the [[Arctic]] and

#### have freely visited and [[trade]]d back and forth across our homeland

#### for thousands of years, thus establishing our [[aboriginal]] rights to free

#### and unrestricted travel and trading all across the [[Arctic]]; and

#### WHEREAS, the Jay [[Treaty]] between the [[United]] [[States]] and England

#### clearly recognizes and protects our rights to unrestricted intercourse

#### and [[trade]] across the U.S./[[Canadian]] border ; and

#### WHEREAS, these guarantees have never been negotiated with

#### [[Denmark]], and have not been properly established in [[Canada]],

#### resulting in the fact that our circumpolar Inuit community does not

#### enjoy the right of free travel and [[trade]] across the [[Canadian]]/

#### Greenlandic border; and

#### WHEREAS, our [[aboriginal]] rights to travel and [[trade]] freely along the

#### [[Arctic]] coast will be an important factor in the economic growth of

#### our circumpolar community;

#### NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the delegates assembled

#### at the first Inuit Circumpolar Conference call upon the Governments

#### of [[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Denmark]] to negotiate an

#### agreement that will protect for all Inuit the right to unrestricted

#### [[trade]] and travel as envisaged between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]

#### by the Jay [[Treaty]].^95

#### While the Jay [[Treaty]] originally envisaged unrestricted [[trade]] and travel

#### across the border, the provision relating to [[trade]] was never codified in

#### § 289 – an array of customs and environ[[mental]] laws govern the transport

#### of goods across the border. The regulations and restrictions imposed by

#### these laws often provide exceptions for the traditions of [[indigenous]]

#### communities; however, these exceptions rarely contemplate cross-border

#### cultures, and may only be asserted by communities on one side of

#### the border. Without Jay [[Treaty]] protection in this regard, cross-border

#### [[indigenous]] cultures would be well-served with a strong proponent in

#### international policy and legislative development. The ICC is not only a

#### Permanent Participant of the [[Arctic]] Council, but it also holds Special

#### Consultative Status with the [[United]] Nations, and has been involved

#### with the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Convention

#### on the Trade of Endangered Species, the World Intellectual Property

#### Organization, the Organization of [[America]]n [[States]], the International

#### Whaling Commission, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the

#### International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).^96 These

#### global connections make the organisation a strong player in developing

#### the [[Arctic]]. As the [[Arctic]] continues to develop, the ICC is an ideal advocate

#### for cross-border policies that recognise and respect the traditional

#### practices of cross-border cultures.

## 3.6. Cross-Border Culture and Commerce

#### Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] states in part ‘\[n\]o duty of entry shall ever be

#### levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation

#### into the said territories respectively, nor shall the [[Indian]]s passing or

#### repassing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever nature,

#### pay for the same any import or duty whatever’.^97 However, the US

#### [[government]] does not recognise the continued validity of this provision in

#### the way it has Jay [[Treaty]] rights regarding free passage.^98

#### In US v. Garrow , a [[1937]] US Court of Customs and Patent Appeals

#### case, the court opined that the Jay [[Treaty]], including its duties provision,

#### was abrogated by the [[War]] of [[1812]].^99 The court maintained the [[Treaty]] of

#### Ghent was not self-executing and was not enacted by legislation;

#### therefore, no [[treaty]] right remained for the duties provision.^100 Although

#### statutory exemptions from customs duties had been maintained in

#### various iterations of the Tariff Act, the exemption was deleted in [[1897]].^101

#### No legal basis remained for the [[Treaty]]’s duties provision.

#### Nearly 30 years later, the federal district court in Akins v. Saxbe noted

#### that language granting [[Indian]]s the right to pass with their goods duty free

#### ‘was not included in the Tariff Act of [[1897]],^102 and it has not been included

#### in any subsequent tariff act’.^103 It maintained questions of customs duties

#### and importation to be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the customs

#### courts.^104 Meanwhile, in [[2001]], the SCC held that there exists no [[aboriginal]]

#### right to transport goods duty free across the US-[[Canada]] border.^105

#### Despite restrictive policies in force today, traditional [[indigenous]]

#### cross-border commerce and culture is well-documented: ‘\[a\]boriginal

###### This content downloaded from 192.30.202.8 on Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:25:54 UTC

#### economies were vibrant – they produced and [[trade]]d, often over long

#### distances and through elaborate [[trade]] coalitions. Trading relations

#### evolved over millennia... It is a mistake to assume that [[Aboriginal]]

#### peoples and their economies were local, static, subsistence-oriented or

#### unresponsive to opportuni ties for wealth generation.’^106

#### Even if the communities cannot access one another to the extent

#### they once did, their long-standing traditions of cross-border commerce

#### and culture continue to survive despite the US-[[Canada]] border; a boundary

#### line aptly described as a ‘figment of someone else’s imagination’.^107

#### Indeed, ‘\[f\]rom the [[Indian]] viewpoint, he crosses no boundary line. For

#### him this does not exist.’^108

#### The Blackfeet (US) and Kainai (also known as the Blood or

#### Kainaiwa) ([[Canada]]) provide an illustration of the many tribes whose

#### lands were bifurcated by the drawing of this boundary line, and whose

#### traditional practices are affected by its imposition.^109 ‘Today there is con-

#### siderable intermarriage and contact \[between the Blackfeet and Kainai\]

#### through social, recreational and religious events... These gatherings

#### form the center of tribal cultural and religious life. Tribal members often

#### [[trade]] animals, meat, berries, roots, herbs, handmade goods and medicine

#### bundles at these events.’^110 However, both ‘[[Canadian]] and [[America]]n

#### customs laws... forbid the import and export of certain plants and animals

#### that are significant in ceremonial life. In addition, these laws require a

#### search of all goods, thereby inhibiting the exercise of tribal culture and

#### religion.’^111 While a customs search may seem a benign inconvenience to

#### a non-[[indigenous]] person, it can be devastating to the integrity of certain

#### sacred items.^112

#### The current debate over eagle feathers, which carry religious

#### significance for many [[indigenous]] cultures, provides an illustration of

#### the competing interests and policies at play. Under the Bald and Golden

#### Eagle Protection Act (BGEPA), possession of eagles or eagle parts carries

#### civil and criminal penalties.^113 However, a religious exception to BGEPA

#### allows enrolled members of federally-recognised [[Indian]] tribes to apply

#### for a permit allowing them to possess or take bald or [[gold]]en eagles or

#### their parts.^114 Policies exist to allow members of federally-recognised

#### tribes to travel with eagle parts between the US and [[Canada]] or [[Mexico]]

#### without a permit in certain circumstances,^115 and [[Canadian]]s presenting

#### a Certificate of [[Indian]] Status may travel in and out of the US with

#### eagle parts under similar circumstances.^116 All items are still subject to

#### customs declarations.^117 Because the policy for [[Canadian]]s is restricted

#### to those carrying a Certificate of [[Indian]] Status, it necessarily excludes

#### non-status [[Indian]]s.

#### Outside of ceremonial implications, well-intentioned and important

#### legislation aimed at protecting endangered or threatened wildlife has

#### also created unanticipated economic difficulties for [[indigenous]] [[Canadian]]

#### populations, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) being one

#### example.^118 The MMPA bans the import of marine mammals and marine

#### mammal products into the US.^119 The practical effect is ‘\[a\]n [[America]]n

#### [[Indian]] or Eskimo living one mile west of the [[Alaska]]n-[[Yukon]] border can

#### sell traditional handicrafts made from seal skin into the “lower 48”, while

#### a [[Canadian]] [[Aboriginal]] person living one mile east of the same border,

#### cannot do so’.^120

#### Another challenge to cross-border mobility for [[ABC]]s is the [[Western]]

#### Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) – a result of the Intelligence Reform

#### and Terrorism Prevention Act of [[2004]] (IRTPA)^121 – which requires

#### US and [[Canadian]] travellers to present a passport or other approved

#### document denoting identity and citizenship when entering the US.^122

#### While WHTI-compliant tribal documents do exist, they are not common,

#### and in their absence, the issue of passports serves as a barrier – particu-

#### larly because [[ABC]] status is not dependent on tribal membership.^123

#### Significant numbers of [[indigenous]] people do not carry US or [[Canadian]]

#### passports, either as a matter of [[sovereignty]] (they consider themselves to

#### be members of their own [[indigenous]] nation, and may choose to carry a

#### tribal passport rather than a US or [[Canadian]] passport) or for practical

#### purposes (it may not be reasonable for a tribal elder living in a remote

#### region to travel to a passport application centre).

#### If WHTI requirements are not modified for [[ABC]]s, their Jay [[Treaty]]

#### right of free passage will remain limited. A non-expiring WHTI-compliant

#### Jay [[Treaty]] Card would remedy this situation. The Jay [[Treaty]] Card could

#### be issued by the Department of Homeland Security upon the applicant

#### evidencing their identity and qualification for the status. The process of

#### documenting as an [[ABC]] is outside the scope of this chapter, but in short,

#### it involves presenting the Department of Homeland Security a host of

#### documentation including long form birth certificates for the applicant,

#### their parents and possibly their grandparents, as well as tribal records

#### that indicate blood quantum.

#### Border security and species protection are the realities of the world

#### we live in, and they will continue to impact [[indigenous]] cross-border

#### commerce and culture. However, it is possible to mitigate adverse effects

#### through recognition of Jay [[Treaty]] principles, encouragement of cross-

#### border relationships and, most importantly, consulting with [[indigenous]]

#### peoples in the development of laws and policies that affect their

#### traditional ways of life.

## 3.7. Conclusion

#### The Jay [[Treaty]]’s provision guarding [[indigenous]] cross-border mobility

#### remains in effect in the US. Meanwhile, [[Canada]] has failed at implement-

#### ing a workable solution to cross-border mobility for US-born [[indigenous]]

#### peoples. [[Canada]] has not developed a workable Jay [[Treaty]] alternative,

#### with the only possible option being the very narrow ‘integral to a distinctive

#### culture test’ set out by the Van der Peet Court – which the [[government]]

#### of [[British]] Columbia has been con[[testing]] relative to its applicability to

#### US-born [[indigenous]] peoples residing in the US, in Desautel.

#### [[Canada]]’s position puts it squarely at odds with Article 36 of the [[United]]

#### Nations Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples, which reads:

#### 1\. [[Indigenous]] peoples, in particular those divided by international

#### borders, have the right to maintain and develop contacts, relations

#### and cooperation, including activities for spiritual, cultural, political,

#### economic and social purposes, with their own members as well as

#### other peoples across borders.

#### 2\. [[States]], in consultation and cooperation with [[indigenous]] peoples,

#### shall take effective measures to facilitate the exercise and ensure

#### the implementation of this right.^124

#### A recent development in [[Canada]] may suggest positive progress toward

#### softening resistance to border crossing rights for [[indigenous]] peoples. In

#### [[2016]], the [[Canadian]] Senate’s Committee on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples heard

#### from [[Canadian]] [[government]]al and [[indigenous]] organisations regarding

#### impediments to the maintenance of cultural and family ties between

#### cross-border [[indigenous]] communities. The Committee recommended

#### that the Minister of [[Indigenous]] and [[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]] appoint a

#### special [[representative]] to explore solutions to border crossing challenges

#### faced by [[indigenous]] communities across [[Canada]].^125 The Minister

#### appointed Fred Caron to this position.^126 He was directed to engage with

#### [[indigenous]] communities on border crossing issues and file a fact-finding

#### report on the outcome of his engagement.

#### Caron filed his report, titled Report on First Nation border crossing

#### issues , on 31 [[August]] [[2017]].^127 The report documents myriad cross-border

#### issues experienced by [[indigenous]] communities across [[Canada]] and

#### addresses potential solutions. Out of all the potential solutions raised in

#### the report, [[Canadian]] ratification of the Jay [[Treaty]] constitutes the broadest

#### and most thorough:

#### ‘\[W\]hile there was a belief on the part of some of the First Nation

#### [[representative]]s I met with that the current issues would not exist

#### had [[Canada]] implemented the Jay [[Treaty]], there was also a view that,

#### in order to set the path forward, what is required is a mechanism to

#### recognize inherent and Jay [[Treaty]] rights in a modern context. All

#### who expressed themselves on the subject were of the view that

#### recognition of these rights should be an integral part of the federal

#### [[government]]’s commitment to reconciliation and the recognition of

#### a nation-to-nation relationship. Such recognition, in their view,

#### would honour and respect their identity as [[North]] [[America]]n [[Indian]]s

#### having long-standing historical relationships with [[Canada]] and the

#### US based on historical [[alliance]]s and [[treaties]].’

#### Whether the report results in [[government]] action remains to be seen.

#### Ultimately, until Jay [[Treaty]] rights receive significant rehabilitation in the

#### US and recognition in [[Canada]], the [[Treaty]]’s intent will be met in only a

#### lukewarm fashion, if at all. Further incursions will rapidly diminish its

#### usefulness to the [[indigenous]] peoples it was designed to serve. Ultimately,

#### it is clear that active engagement of [[indigenous]] communities on this

#### issue, by both the US and [[Canadian]] [[government]]s, is crucial.

Act of [[1790]] was repealed by subsequent
naturalisation acts in [[1795]] and [[1798]],
no relevant change was made regarding
this restriction until the Fourteenth
Amendment in [[1868]]. See [[United]] [[States]]
Constitution, amendment XIV, § 1 (‘All
persons born or naturalized in the [[United]]
[[States]], and subject to the jurisdiction
thereof , are citizens of the [[United]] [[States]]
and of the state wherein they reside’)
(emphasis added). However, ‘[t]he
specific meaning of the language of the
clause was not immediately obvious. In
[[1884]] the [[United]] [[States]] Supreme Court in
Elk v. Wilkins held that [[child]]ren born to
members of [[Indian]] tribes governed by
tribal legal systems were not US citizens.’
112 US 94, 102 ([[1884]]) (‘[[Indian]]s born
within the territorial limits of the [[United]]
[[States]], members of, and owing immediate
allegiance to, one of the [[Indian]]a tribes,

25 Goodwin v. Karnuth, 661 (emphasis

further quoted the definition: ‘For the

other [[aboriginal]] peoples of [[Alaska]] shall be
considered [[Indian]]s.’ The court also looked
to 48 U.S.C. § 206, dealing with territories
and insular possessions, which provided a
short and simple definition: ‘[[Indian]]s:
[[Native]]s with one-half or more [[Indian]]
blood.’ Although there is no definitive
legislative or regulatory [[history]] on the
matter, it is reasonable to assume that the
drafters of § 289 relied on this definition.

31 Spruhan, ‘[[Canadian]] [[Indian]] Free Passage
Right’, 314–15. One possibility for
retention of the bloodline requirement
may be the then national policy of [[Indian]]
termination, which began in the [[1940]]s
and was embraced by the Eisenhower
administration from [[1953]]–60. See Ralph
W. Johnson, ‘Fragile Gains: Two Centuries
of [[Canadian]] and [[United]] [[States]] Policy
Toward [[Indian]]s’, [[Washington]] Law Review
66 ([[1991]]): 643, 662. ‘The [[United]] [[States]]
identified assimilation and integration as
the official rationale for the termination
policy, but there is evidence that the
desire to reduce federal expenditures for
[[Indian]] nations was a major motivation for
the termination acts’. Robert T. Coulter,
Termination, [[Native]] Land Law § 8:2
([[2012]] ed.). The bloodline requirement
serves to disqualify many from status as
[[ABC]]s.
32 Generally, the [[Canadian]] constitution is
understood to comprise two statutes:
The Constitution Act, [[1867]] ([[British]]
[[North]] [[America]] Act or BNAA) and the
Constitution Act, [[1982]]. Part II of the
Constitution Act, [[1982]] sets out the rights
of [[Aboriginal]] peoples. The Third Schedule:

44 The two major organisations representing
Métis maintain different criteria for
qualification: The [[Congress]] of [[Aboriginal]]
Peoples [http://www.abo-peoples.org]
defines Métis as ‘individuals who have
[[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] ancestry,
self-identify themselves as Métis and are
accepted by a Métis community as Métis.’
The Métis National Council [http://www.
metisnation.ca] defines Métis as ‘a person
who self-identifies as Métis, is of historic
Métis Nation ancestry, is distinct from
other [[Aboriginal]] peoples and is accepted
by the Métis Nation.’ Library and Archives

are those who are recognised by the

the [[Indian]] Act, R.S.C. [[1985]], c. I-5.
Non-status [[Indian]]s, on the other hand,
can refer to [[Indian]]s who no longer have

members of mixed communities who have

52 In order for a [[treaty]] to have force in
[[Canada]], implementing legislation is
required. [[Canada]]’s status as a dualist state
and the effect that status has on the Jay
[[Treaty]] was made clear in Francis v. The
[[Queen]]. The terms ‘monism’ and ‘dualism’
have been used to describe different types
of domestic legal systems. Oxford
University, The Oxford Guide to Treaties ,
368 (Duncan B. Hollis ed., Oxford
University Press, [[2012]]). In dualist [[States]],
which include [[Canada]] and almost all
other [[British]] Commonwealth [[States]], ‘no
[[treaties]] have the status of law in the
domestic legal system;... all [[treaties]]
require implementing legislation to have
domestic legal force’. By contrast ‘[In]
[m]onist [[States]]... some [[treaties]] have the
status of law in the domestic legal system,
even in the absence of implementing
legislation.’ Oxford Guide to Treaties , 369.
The Supremacy Clause of the US
Constitution establishes the Constitution,
federal statutes, and US Treaties as ‘the
supreme law of the land’. [[United]] [[States]]
Constitution article VI, clause 2.

55 Francis v. The [[Queen]]. While the case
involved customs issues rather than the
right of US-born [[Indian]]s to cross in to
[[Canada]], both issues fall under the Jay
[[Treaty]]; therefore, its language is important
and relevant to the admissibility of
US-born [[Indian]]s into [[Canada]].
56 In an interesting side-note, the US/
[[Canada]] border itself was created by [[treaty]]
but never codified by legislation in
[[Canada]]. See Phil Bellfy, ‘The Anishnaabeg

68 R. v. Van der Peet, 550–62. The Court
outlined ten factors to consider when
applying the integral to a distinctive
culture test:
```

```
Courts must take into account the
perspective of [[aboriginal]] peoples
themselves... Courts must identify
precisely the nature of the claim being
made in deter[[mining]] whether an
[[aboriginal]] claimant has demonstrated the
existence of an [[aboriginal]] right... In order
to be integral a practice, custom or
tradition must be of central significance to
the [[aboriginal]] society in question [it was
one of the things that truly made the
society what it was]... The practices,
customs and traditions which constitute
[[aboriginal]] rights are those which have
continuity with the practices, customs and
traditions that existed prior to contact
[prior to the arrival of [[Europe]]ans in [[North]]
[[America]]]... Courts must approach the
rules of evidence in light of the
evidentiary difficulties inherent in
adjudicating [[aboriginal]] claims... Claims to
[[aboriginal]] rights must be adjudicated on a
specific rather than general basis [must be
specific to the particular [[aboriginal]]
community claiming the right]... For a
practice, custom or tradition to constitute
an [[aboriginal]] right it must be of

independent significance to the [[aboriginal]]
culture in which it exists... The integral to
a distinctive culture test requires that a
practice, custom or tradition be
distinctive; it does not require that that

The in[[flu]]ence of [[Europe]]an culture will
only be relevant to the inquiry if it is
