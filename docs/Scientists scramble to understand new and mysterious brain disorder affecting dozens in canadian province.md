Forty-eight people in [[[[Canada]]]] have [[battle]]d a rare and debilitating brain disorder.

It closely mimics the [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob]] disease, a fatal [[brain disorder]] that affects only 1 in 1 million people each year, [according to a [[Washington]] Post report].

For those who have suffered the symptoms of this new disorder, tests for #Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have come up negative, and experts can’t seem to find a cause.

Patients have ranged in age from 18 to 85 and have lived in the Moncton area or the [[New]] [[Brunswick]] Acadian peninsula.

For now, it’s being referred to as the [[Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause]]. Officials are currently looking into the [[New]] [[Brunswick]] Cluster.

Of the 48 people who have been identified as having symptoms of the unknown syndrome, six have died, as of Monday.

“The suffering is immense … because it’s beyond physical,” said neurologist Alier Marrero, who works at Moncton’s Dr. Georges-L.-[[Dumont University Hospital Center]]. “There’s also the [[neuropsychiatric]] and moral suffering of the patients that is only partially relieved by medications.”

Some of the symptoms patients are developing include:

-   Sleep disorders, including severe insomnia
    

-   Rapid and unexplained weight loss
    

-   [[Capgras delusion]], which makes patients believe their family members have been replaced by imposters
    

“The rapidity in the constellation of features is something that -- I’ve not seen this before,” said Michael Strong, the neurologist who heads the [[Canadian]] Institutes of Health [[Research]].

[[The [[Washington]] Post]]reports the cluster of cases was detected by the federal public [[health]] agency’s Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance system, which monitors for CJD and other prion disorders.

[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes] prion diseases as a “family of rare progressive neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. They are distinguished by long incubation periods, characteristic spongiform changes associated with neuronal loss, and a failure to induce inflammatory response.”

The brain of a person with a prion disease can resemble sponges with small holes.

The first case of this new disorder experts in the area were made aware of was in [[[[2015]]]], but Marrero could not find a diagnosis. From [[[[2018]]]] on, others presented with similar symptoms, and 11 new cases in [[[[2019]]]] would eventually be identified as part of the cluster. There were 24 more in [[[[2020]]]], at which time Marrero and Coulthart began thinking they could be dealing with something new.

“We say that they were resistant to diagnosis,” said Michael Coulthart, who heads the [[CJD]] surveillance system. “That’s what had to emerge as a pattern before we started talking about a cluster.”

It is believed the syndrome has a two-year incubation period.

Scientists have looked into many avenues for an explanation, including environ[[mental]] exposures, travel histories, diet, as well as blood screenings for a presence of infectious diseases known to cause neurological symptoms, auto[[immune]] disorders, metabolic deficits and cancer.

None of those tests have provided an answer.

A cerebrospinal [[flu]]id test for high levels of protein markers is what can help to diagnose CJD, but all of the patients have come up with a negative test result.

“These cases, for all intents and purposes by their description, should be CJD,” Strong said. “That’s what they sound like and are presenting like, and yet, the [[testing]] is negative.”

Two theories include that the syndrome could be tied to exposure to an environ[[mental]] toxin, or that it is being caused by an entirely new prion disorder.

A spokesperson with the [[Department of Health]] said the department is working to identify all potential causes for the unknown disease.

Coulthart said he believes that attention will help them to arrive at an answer.

“Fear is understandable,” Marrero said. “But we are working for hope.”
