For 110 years, the numbers stood as gospel: 618,222 men died in the Civil [[War]], 360,222 from the [[North]] and 258,000 from the [[South]] — by far the greatest toll of any war in [[America]]n [[history]].

But new [[research]] shows that the numbers were far too low.

By combing through newly digitized census data from the 19th century, J. David Hacker, a demographic historian from Binghamton University in [[New]] York, has [recalculated the [[death]] toll](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/[[2011]]/09/20/recounting-the-dead/#more-105317 "Article by Dr. Hacker on Times Opinionator blog.") and increased it by more than 20 percent — to 750,000.

The new figure is already winning acceptance from scholars. Civil [[War]] History, the journal that published [Dr. Hacker’s paper](http://www2.binghamton.edu/[[history]]/docs/Hacker_CW_dead.pdf "Text of paper."), called it “among the most consequential pieces ever to appear” in its pages. And a pre-eminent authority on the era, [Eric Foner](http://www.ericfoner.com/ "Times article"), a historian at Columbia University, said:

“It even further elevates the significance of the Civil [[War]] and makes a dramatic statement about how the war is a central moment in [[America]]n [[history]]. It helps you understand, particularly in the [[South]] with a much smaller population, what a devastating experience this was.”

The old figure dates back well over a century, the work of two Union Army veterans who were passionate amateur historians: William F. Fox and Thomas Leonard Livermore.

Fox, who had fought at Antietam, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, knew well the horrors of the Civil [[War]]. He did his [[research]] the hard way, reading every muster list, [[battle]]field report and pension record he could find.

In his [[[1889]] treatise](http://www.civilwarhome.com/foxspref.htm) “Regi[[mental]] Losses in the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], [[1861]]-[[1865]],” Fox presented an immense mass of information. Besides the aggregate [[death]] count, [[research]]ers could learn that the Fifth [[New]] Hampshire lost more soldiers (295 [[kill]]ed) than any other Union regiment; that Gettysburg and Waterloo were almost equivalent [[battle]]s, with each of the four combatant armies suffering about 23,000 casualties; that the Union Army had 166 regiments of black troops; and that the average Union soldier was 5 feet 8 1/4 inches tall and weighed 143 1/2 pounds.

Fox’s estimate of Confederate [[battle]]field [[death]]s was much rougher, however: a “round number” of 94,000, a figure compiled from after-action reports. In [[1900]], Livermore set out to make a more complete count. In his book, “[Numbers and Losses in the Civil [[War]] in [[America]], [[1861]]-65](http://archive.org/stream/numbersandlosse00livegoog "E-book"),” he reasoned that if the Confederates had lost proportionally the same number of soldiers to disease as the Union had, the actual number of Confederate dead should rise to 258,000.

And that was that. The Fox-Livermore numbers continued to be cited well into the 21st century, even though few historians were satisfied with them. Among many others, James M. McPherson used them without citing the source in “Battle Cry of Freedom,” his Pulitzer-winning [[1988]] [[history]] of the war.

Enter Dr. Hacker, a specialist in 19th-century demographics, who was accustomed to using a system called the two-census method to calculate mortality. That method compares the number of 20-to-30-year-olds in one census with the number of 30-to-40-year-olds in the next census, 10 years later. The difference in the two figures is the number of people who died in that age group.

Pretty simple — but, Dr. Hacker soon realized, too simple for counting Civil [[War]] dead. Published census data from the era did not differentiate between native-born [[America]]ns and immigrants; about 500,000 foreign-born soldiers served in the Union Army alone.

“If you have a lot of immigrants age 20 moving in during one decade, it looks like negative mortality 10 years later,” Dr. Hacker said. While the Census Bureau in [[1860]] asked people their birthplace, the information never made it into the printed report.

As for Livermore’s assumption that [[death]]s from disease could be correlated with [[battle]]field [[death]]s, Dr. Hacker found that wanting too. The Union had better medical care, food and shelter, especially in the war’s final years, suggesting that [[South]]ern losses to disease were probably much higher. Also, [[research]] has shown that soldiers from rural areas were more susceptible to disease and died at a higher rate than city dwellers. The Confederate Army had a higher percentage of farm boys.

Dr. Hacker said he realized in [[2010]] that a rigorous recalculation could finally be made if he used newly available detailed census data presented on the Internet by the [Minnesota Population Center](http://www.pop.umn.edu/ "Times article") at the University of Minnesota.

The center’s Integrated Public Use Microdata Series had put [[representative]] samples of in-depth, sortable information for individuals counted in 19th-century censuses. This meant that by sorting by place of birth, Dr. Hacker could count only the native-born.

Another hurdle was what Dr. Hacker called the “dreadful” [[1870]] census, a badly handled undercount taken when the ashes of the war were still warm. But he reasoned a way around that problem.

Because the census takers would quite likely have missed as many women as men, he decided to look at the ratio of male to female [[death]]s in [[1870]]. Next, he examined mortality figures from the decades on either side of the war — the [[1850]]s and [[1870]]s — so that he could get an idea of the “normal” ratio of male to female [[death]]s for a given decade. When he compared those ratios to that of [[1860]]-70, he reasoned, he would see a dramatic spike in male mortality. And he did. Subtracting normal attrition from the male side of the equation left him with a rough estimate of war dead.

It was a better estimate than Fox and Livermore had produced, but Dr. Hacker made it clear that his was not the final answer. He had made several assumptions, each of which stole accuracy from the final result. Among them: that there were no war-related [[death]]s of [[white]] women; that the expected normal mortality rate in the [[1860]]s would be the average of the rates in the [[1850]]s and [[1870]]s; that foreign soldiers died at the same rate as native-born soldiers; and that the [[War]] Department figure of 36,000 black war dead had to be accepted as accurate because black women suffered so terribly both during and after the war that they could not be used as a control for male mortality.

The study had two significant shortcomings. Dr. Hacker could make no estimate of civilian [[death]]s, an enduring question among historians, “because the overall number is too small relative to the overall number of soldiers [[kill]]ed.” And he could not tell how many of the [[battle]]field dead belonged to each side.

“You could assume that everyone born in the Deep [[South]] fought for the Confederacy and everyone born in the [[North]] fought for the Union,” he said. “But the border states were a nightmare, and my confidence in the results broke down quickly.”

With all the uncertainties, Dr. Hacker said, the data suggested that 650,000 to 850,000 men died as a result of the war; he chose the midpoint as his estimate.

He emphasized that his methodology was far from perfect. “Part of me thinks it is just a curiosity,” he said of the new estimate.

“But wars have profound economic, demographic and social costs,” he went on. “We’re seeing at least 37,000 more widows here, and 90,000 more orphans. That’s a profound social impact, and it’s our duty to get it right.”
