20. Accommodating the Inuit
majority: Traditional placenames in
[[Nunavut]] today
Lynn Peplinski
Inuit Heritage Trust, [[Nunavut]]
For 4,000 years, Inuit and their predecessors have combed the almost 2 million
square kilometres of the northern [[Canadian]] landscape, now known to the world
as [[Nunavut]], “Our Land”. Evidence of extensive Inuit land use and occupancy is
present in the more than 8,000 placenames that, lamentably, have yet to appear
on official maps. While recognition of the Inuit home land came in [[1993]] with the
signing of the [[Nunavut]] Land Claims Agreement, maps of the [[Arctic]] continue to
reflect centuries of [[Europe]]an exploration and discovery. The Inuit Heritage Trust
has been documenting Inuit traditional placenames and has submitted close to
5,000 placenames to the Government of [[Nunavut]] to make them official since
[[2005]], and estimate that more than 3,000 still need to be verified and processed.
This paper grew out of a meeting with members of the Geographic Names Board
of [[Canada]] who were assembled in Yellowknife, [[North]]west [[Territories]] in [[August]]
[[2007]]. Here, the author spoke with provincial and territorial [[representative]]s
from across [[Canada]] about issues relating to [[aboriginal]] placenaming policies
with particular attention to the use of non-[[aboriginal]] generics. Given that the
[[Canadian]] Government’s Principles and Procedures for Geographical Naming
state that first priority shall be given to names with long-standing local usage
by the general public, and Inuit comprise 85 per cent of the population in
[[Nunavut]], the time for Inuit names to appear on [[Canada]]’s maps is overdue.
Twenty years after the signing of the [[Nunavut]] Land Claims Agreement, thousands
of traditional placenames have been documented and submitted to the Government
of [[Nunavut]] (GN) but have yet to appear on [[Canada]]’s official maps. Traditional
placenames clearly demonstrate the extent of Inuit land use and occupancy of the
vast northern land that is [[Nunavut]]. Given the enduring presence of Inuit living in
[[Nunavut]], and the steady domestic and international interest in the potential of a
northwest passage in [[Canada]]’s north, there are many reasons why Inuit traditional
placenames should see the light of day.

[[Indigenous]] and Minority Placenames

While [[Canada]] is officially a bilingual nation with both English and [[French]]
enjoying equal status, only 23 per cent of the population considers [[French]] as
their mother tongue, and an overwhelming majority of francophones (18.5 per
cent) are concentrated in one province, the province of [[Quebec]].1
In [[Nunavut]], a different version of bilingualism reigns with Inuktitut dominating
[[French]]. Geographically isolated from the rest of [[Canada]] – its remoteness due
to distance from and the lack of road infrastructure linking it to the rest of
[[Canada]], [[Nunavut]] has been home to Inuit and their predecessors for the past
4,000 years. Today, the territory boasts a population of about 32,000, 85 per
cent of whom are Inuit, settled in 23 communities.2 There are arguably two Inuit
languages in [[Nunavut]]. Inuktitut is spoken in all but two communities, where
Inuinnaqtun is spoken. Each community is made up of speakers of one or more
dialects depending upon where the family groups’ ancestors lived on the land
prior to moving into established communities around 50 years ago. There can be
many dialects present in one community, again depending on where individual
families resided on the land prior to moving into established settlements.
The year [[2013]] marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the largest land claim
in [[Canadian]] [[history]], the [[Nunavut]] Land Claims Agreement (NLCA). [[Nunavut]],
formerly part of the [[North]]west [[Territories]], covers just less than 2 million square
kilometres occupying one fifth of [[Canada]]’s land mass.
Created under the NLCA, the Inuit Heritage Trust exists to support an Inuit
voice on issues relating to heritage including archaeology and placenames. With
regards to traditional placenames, the Inuit Heritage Trust (IHT) organisation
has two main goals:
1. The distribution, in communities, of traditional placenames knowledge on
topographic, thematic maps.
2. Ensuring the traditional names are made official. This is also a land claim
obligation for IHT (NLCA, Article 33 Part 9).
IHT’s policy regarding naming features on maps is to capture the most appropriate
dialect for the place where possible. That is, the dialects of descendants of family
groups tied to specific geographical areas receive priority. Names for the same
features, in other dialects may appear in the legend of the map. This effort is also
explicitly noted on the individual map sheets produced by IHT.

20. Accommodating the Inuit majority: Traditional placenames in [[Nunavut]] today

Greenland, whose capital city of Nuuk is just two hours by air charter east
of Iqaluit, [[Nunavut]]’s capital city, has approached the dialect issue differently.
Whereas in [[Nunavut]], efforts are made to respect and record placenames in local
dialects, in Greenland, the official language in all documentation including
placenames is the Nuuk dialect of Inuktitut (language of the Inuit, also referred
to as Greenlandic). Individuals in small communities are encouraged to speak
their own dialects and maintain their own traditional placenames, but all written
documentation, including placenames on maps, is in the Nuuk dialect. Also in
Greenland, all names are written in roman orthography, a result of the Inuit
language there having benefited from the written word more than 100 years
earlier than its [[Canadian]] cousins. For these and other reasons, Greenlanders
enjoy maps with their traditional Inuit names entirely in Greenlandic.3 Also
worth pointing out is the disfavour with which Inuktitut names on maps are
viewed by some non-Inuit. In a personal email from a staff person in a Danish
Geodata Agency, Greenlandic maps were described as a “path of thorns for
international users”.4 Not everyone is impressed by the move to finally legitimise
traditional [[indigenous]] names by putting them onto maps.
When compared with other [[indigenous]] populations in the world, Inuit of
the eastern [[Arctic]] enjoy one of the highest percentages of native-language
speakers: 64 per cent of the population in [[Nunavut]] can converse in Inuktitut
or Inuinnaqtun.5 In the central and eastern [[arctic]], the preferred orthography
is still syllabics. This writing system was introduced by missionaries in the
late [[1800]]s to a people that had heretofore no written language. In a personal
communication Kenn Harper, a local author and historian, recounted that when
syllabics were introduced in the eastern [[arctic]], people could learn the basic
system in a couple of hours and then were expected to teach it to someone else.
In this way the early system of syllabics swept through the eastern [[arctic]]. In a
very short time after the introduction of syllabics, missionaries made Inuktitut
reading materials available to Inuit in their own language.6
Though most young Nunavummiut (residents of [[Nunavut]]) in schools today
learn English and use roman orthography, they also learn to write Inuktitut
in syllabics. There is considerable debate about the advisability of maintaining
two distinct writing systems, with some favouring abandoning syllabics for
roman orthography; however, syllabics still appear to have strong support. In
IHT’s experience, Inuit in communities prefer to read Inuktitut placenames on

paper maps or in [[Google]] Earth, in syllabics. Thus the Inuit Heritage Trust is
committed to producing maps with traditional placenames using syllabics. The
[[Canadian]] Government, however, when it publishes maps for the wider public
with the newly adopted traditional names, will transcribe the names in roman
orthography. The volume of names, and the length of the names themselves
may be problematic for [[government]] cartographers on a practical level. The
syllabics characters combine consonant/vowel sounds (i, pi, ti, ki gi represented
as syllabics) thus taking up less space on the map. A practical solution may be
to limit the number of names on the maps, a standard practice in cartography
but an unsatisfactory one for northern travellers. Typically the scale of a map
dictates the amount of information that can be included. More placenames may
be expected to be found on maps at larger scales such as 1:50,000 (of which there
are 16 in an area covered by a 1:250,000 map). However, in IHT’s experience,
people prefer to see all the placenames information on 1:250,000 scale maps,
with none omitted for the sake of a clean, uncluttered map. Given the vast
distances hunters may cover in a day of travel by boat or snow machine, one
reference map, rather than more than a dozen, is far more practical.
Draft topographic maps produced by IHT may contain hundreds of traditional
placenames. One map (1:250,000) in particular, for an area of Cumberland
Sound near Pangnirtung contains over 400 traditional placenames – a daunting
challenge for the cartographer.7 If and when Inuit traditional placenames become
official, will the [[Canadian]] Government be able to demonstrate them satisfactorily
on maps? Unfortunately, IHT only has resources enough to produce a small
selection of maps that are shared with communities. Though at the federal level
there is currently a small group of individuals in the Mapping Information
Branch that has been trying to promote interest in a program to produce
“[[Canadian]] [[Arctic]] Prototype Maps – Customized, Multilingual, Topographic”,
they have been unsuccessful due to reduced budgets.8
Concern exists that if not added to current maps, traditional names will become a
relic of a way of life only 50 years ago – a way of life which has been rapidly and
even traumatically replaced by modernity. However, the land has not changed
and neither has the need to know and understand the land, if not for one’s
absolute survival, then for Inuit to retain a sense of themselves and their culture.
Traditional placenames allow today’s Inuit to maintain an appreciation and an
intimate connection to the land, similar to that of their predecessors. By way of
7 Map 26J is the map with the greatest number of traditional, but still unofficial placenames (as of 09/[[2013]])
in [[Nunavut]]. This map was made by the [[Canada]]-[[Nunavut]] Geo[[[[science]]]] Office in partnership with IHT and may

example, in the summer of [[2007]], a group of hunters attempted to trap beluga
whales in an inlet on the descending tide by throwing rocks into the water to
keep the belugas in, trapping them behind a sand bar. The inlet, Millorialik,
“where you throw something”, is named for this activity. Despite the hunters’
efforts, the beluga managed to escape. The hunters left the area disappointed
but with a renewed sense of the challenge experienced by their predecessors to
survive on the land.9 Formerly for Inuit, the animals meant everything: food,
shelter, tools, transportation. Besides a few wild roots and berries, there was
no other option for sustaining life in this harsh northern country. Though
modernity has meant a move to settlements, heated homes and the availability
of store-bought food, hunting remains a necessary cultural activity to put food
on the table. A study exploring the issue of food security in [[Nunavut]] found that
relying exclusively on market food is an unaffordable option for many families
(Chan et al. [[2006]]: 416–431). Traditional placenames not only offer insight into
past land use but practical information for the modern hunter.
[[Nunavut]] is still a relatively new territory and the population small. There are
fewer than a handful of individuals working on placenames issues on a regular
basis. Therefore, progress to make traditional placenames official is slow. In [[2009]],
IHT submitted 11 maps to the Government of [[Nunavut]] containing approximately
900 traditional placenames. Two of these maps (with a total of 290 names) have
gone through the GN system and may be official as of 2[[014]]. Since [[2011]] an
additional 4,000 were submitted to the GN to be made official. There still remain
thousands of names that need to find their way onto official maps.

1. Generics
The issue of generics and how these are handled across jurisdictions varies.
There are a relative few traditional placenames currently dotting [[Nunavut]]’s
maps, the ones placed there when the territory was part of the [[North]]west
[[Territories]] and prior to a made-in-[[Nunavut]] Toponymy Policy. However, all of
these names are accompanied by English generics. For example, Qikiqtarjuaq
Island and Tasiujarjuaq Lake are both very common names meaning Big (-juaq)
Island (Qikiq-) and Big (-juaq) Lake (Tasi-), making the added English “Lake” or
“Island” generics redundant. Examples of this tautology are also very common
for maps in northern [[Quebec]].
The province of [[Quebec]], located south of [[Nunavut]] has more than 7 million
inhabitants with more than 80 per cent claiming [[French]] as their first language.10

However, the northern third of the province, a region known as Nunavik, is
sparsely populated with about 10,000 Inuit living in 14 communities scattered
along the coast. Here Inuktitut is the first language of over 90 per cent of the
Inuit population according to the Avataq Cultural Institute.11 In everyday
communications, therefore, English and [[French]] take a back seat to Inuktitut
in the lives of the people who have lived in this northern land for centuries.
In a sense, Nunavik is a nation within a nation, geographically isolated from
the more densely populated part of the province, as [[Quebec]] is also a unique
nation within the larger [[Canada]] because of its culture, language and set of laws
(Sheppard [[2006]]).
In [[Canada]], Inuit distinguish themselves from other First Nations groups. That is,
Inuit do not fall under the general umbrella of First Nations; they remain their
own distinct group. In [[Quebec]], as in most of the provinces and territories in
[[Canada]], [[aboriginal]] (First Nations peoples including Inuit) make up 8.1 per cent of
the province’s population, with some First Nations living on reserves, some not.12
On the Nunavik ([[Quebec]]) maps much effort was undertaken to document almost
8,000 traditional Inuit names which were eventually published in an Avataq
Cultural Institute gazetteer in [[1987]].13 However, those traditional names were
altered by the Commission Toponymique du [[Quebec]] when they were made
official, by the addition of [[French]] generics. With regards to generics, the [[Quebec]]
Toponymy Policy (adopted in [[1987]] and revised in [[1990]]) states that:
[[Aboriginal]] place names that contain a generic (attached to or separate
from the specific) in their language of origin are assigned a generic in
[[French]] when they are officialized. This [[French]] generic represents the
best possible translation of the [[Aboriginal]] term.
The separate [[Aboriginal]] generic is not included in the official name,
unless it constitutes the sole element of the original place name. To
counter the often negative reaction to the [[Aboriginal]] place names that
are considered too long and difficult to pronounce or remember, the
Commission may officialize shortened versions of inventoried names
provided their meaning is not lost as a result.

20. Accommodating the Inuit majority: Traditional placenames in [[Nunavut]] today

When an [[Aboriginal]] place name does not include a generic in its original
form, the Commission, in officializing the name, will add a [[French]]
generic if and when this type of place name is usually expressed with a
generic in [[French]].14
One could argue that adding [[French]] generics makes placenames more accessible
to the “whole” [[Quebec]] community. However, the “whole” by large majority, in
this particular region of [[Quebec]] consider Inuktitut to be their first language.
The added [[French]] generic effectively changes the name. Also, if you are a
native speaker the name/generic combination becomes almost farcical because
of the tautology.
Given the geographical isolation of many Inuit communities from the more
densely populated parts of [[Canada]] and the intense role the land plays in
everyone’s lives, in addition to the language reality, Inuit and the wider public
may be better served by the publication of a glossary of Inuktitut placenames.
Such a glossary would provide insight into the language and the world view
present in the traditional naming system of Inuit in northern [[Canada]] rather
than adding a generic to satisfy the [[French]]/English speaking minority.
Kearns and Berg ([[2002]]) discuss the issue of placenames as a form of resistance and
contend that resistance to naming can occur on at least two levels: the creation
and deployment of alternate names and the use of alternative pronunciations for
established names. By its policy to replace [[aboriginal]] placename generics with
[[French]] ones, or to add generics to [[aboriginal]] names, is the [[Quebec]] Government,
through its Toponymy Policy, resisting efforts by Inuit wishing their own names
to be legitimised? This exercise has its roots in [[Quebec]]’s Charter of the [[French]]
Language, safeguarding [[French]], in [[Quebec]], as the dominant language.
[[Quebec]] is an interesting case because it is the largest province in [[Canada]] in area
(the three northern territories do not count as provinces) and the second largest
in population. As a primarily [[French]]-speaking province, [[Quebec]] has fought
long and hard against the cultural domination of the English majority in [[Canada]].
By introducing Bill 101, the Charter of the [[French]] Language, the [[government]] has
sought to protect the language and to ensure the province’s status and future
as a [[French]]-speaking nation. All signage, commercial advertising, street signs
and services, as well as placenames generics, are in [[French]]. As has been noted
though, fully a third of [[Quebec]]’s land mass is understood to be Inuit territory,
where a version of a self rule accord looms. Criticism of [[Quebec]]’s Charter of the
[[French]] Language has been widespread, considered by some to be an infringement
on their rights and freedom to work, be educated or read or post signage in their
14 Commission de Toponymie [[Québec]], ‘Politiques de la Commission de toponymie ([[1990]])’, http://www.
toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/toponymie_expliquee/politiques_topo.html (accessed 20 [[May]] [[2007]]).

language of choice, most often English. However, 30 years after its introduction
Bill 101 has been reported as being relatively well accepted in the province
(Bauch [[2007]]).
According to Danielle Turcotte, Director, Commission de toponymie, the
[[Quebec]] Government is currently seeking a way to publish on the web both the
official placenames as well as the unofficial [[aboriginal]] placenames in a way that
will underline the official status of names while also providing visibility for
the purposes of conservation of the [[aboriginal]] placenames in the memories of
[[aboriginal]] communities.15
For Nunavummiut to insist on their traditional names becoming official is a
logical, natural follow up to the [[Nunavut]] Land Claims Agreement. Kearns and
Berg ([[2002]]) also note that:
Place names are publicly pronounced, [and] there is thus scope to not
only identify a point on the map, but also to make a point through
(metaphorically) mapping out one’s politics of place in speech. (Kearns
and Berg [[2002]]: 287)
Indeed, the [[Nunavut]] Land Claims Agreement is the largest in [[Canadian]] [[history]].
[[Nunavut]] is not [[Nunavut]] Territory, it is [[Nunavut]] (without the added generic);
translated as Our Land, the name is a significant statement when one locates
this massive territory on a map. Accordingly, all traditional placenames are
expected to be accepted as is, without the addition of English generics. There
is an exception to this rule, however. The Geographic Names Board of [[Canada]]
maintains a list of names of pan-[[Canadian]] significance. The names on this list of
prominent geographical features are to appear in all official documentation with
English and [[French]] names only. This may not be hugely problematic given that
many of the more prominent geographical features identified as having pan[[Canadian]] significance do not have traditional names. For example, Inuit tended
not to name large features that extended for hundreds of kilometres (Frobisher
[[Bay]] or the whole of Cumberland Sound or Baffin Island). There are exceptions
however, as in the case of seven First Nations groups in the [[North]]west [[Territories]],
each traditionally having their own name to the Mackenzie River, a significant
river in [[Canada]]’s north-west.16
As noted earlier in this chapter, a staff member from the Danish Geodata Agency
referred to Greenlandic placenames as a path of thorns. While Greenlandic
names on maps and charts may be difficult to pronounce, so are many foreign
names to the uninitiated anywhere. However, those Greenlandic names are also
a pronouncement; they make a strong statement about the Inuit presence on the
15 Pers. comm. with Danielle Turcotte, Commission de toponymie du [[Quebec]], by email, [[2007]].

islands and in the fiords of Kalallit Nunaat (Greenland). Also worth pointing
out is that English or [[French]] or Danish names, as in the Greenland example,
are equally difficult for native Inuktitut speakers to pronounce. Despite the fact
that there are maps with official English toponyms in [[Nunavut]], Inuit continue to
refer to places on the land using traditional Inuktitut names, which to them, are
far more informative, and easier to pronounce in their own language. Finally, as
stated in the [[Canadian]] Government’s Principles and Procedures for Geographical
Naming [[2011]], Principle 2:
First priority shall be given to names with long-standing local usage by
the general public. Unless there are good reasons to the contrary, this
principle should prevail.
Consider the following passage by [[Canadian]] author Peter Steele, in his book,
The Man who Mapped the [[Arctic]]:
The chaps in this narrative were much exercised about maps. Mapping
was why they were there. The [[indigenous]] peoples appear to have
given few names to prominent geographical features, certainly not the
plethora that sprang from visits by [[Europe]]ans. Franklin, Back, and
other explorers could, and did, walk in and map a continent. Then by
way of recognizing their patrons and sponsors these first “[[white]] men”
sprinkled the maps they drew with the names of luminaries, major and
minor, who are now recorded in perpetuity to the total denial of the
native culture. (Steele [[2003]]: xx)
(As a northerner himself, Steele apparently had little awareness of the extent of
traditional [[aboriginal]] placenames that existed prior to these “others” entering
the scene.)
The type and scale of features named on maps gives insight into many aspects
of the Inuit presence on the land. The explorers and other adventurers who
bestowed their names on the coastal areas often did so from the decks of their
relatively large ships. With these they also travelled faster than did Inuit in their
small qajait (kayaks) in summer or fall, or by dog team or on foot in winter. There
are many examples where names of large inlets and other bodies of water do not
have Inuktitut counterparts to the “colonial” ones on the maps. However, the
more discrete features within those larger bodies do have traditional names. For
example, only the end of Frobisher [[Bay]] is named Tasiujarjuaq (like a big lake);
the name represents almost a third of the whole named bay that is hemmed in
by islands, but not the whole bay.
A working paper prepared for a [[2004]] meeting of the [[United]] Nations Group of

names into official nomenclature.17 In this paper, O’Brien notes that at one time
names that were deemed cumbersome and unpronounceable were shortened or
rejected and that, in recent years, the provincial and territorial names boards have
been more open to the approval of names with long specifics. Both examples of
long names (one had 31 letters) still had English and [[French]] generics attached to
them. However, the author does note further in the document that geographical
names usually include both a specific and a generic and that the generic term
will be in English, [[French]], or in an [[aboriginal]] language.
Beyond [[Quebec]], a look at the [[treatment]] of generics and placenames in other
[[Canadian]] provinces and territories and the [[United]] [[States]] follows.

2. Moving from west to east across [[Canada]]18
Janet [[Mason]], Provincial Toponymist in [[British]] Columbia (BC), related that
as part of the Nisga’a [[Treaty]] signed in [[1999]], 40 traditional placenames were
adopted into legislation. However, despite there being intensive native
language programs in schools since this time, these names, entirely in the
Nisga’a language, are not in local use, suggesting a disconnect between the
older and younger generations. [[British]] Columbia’s Toponymy Policy, available
on the internet, states that placenames will be accepted in a single language
form; however, despite this statement, [[aboriginal]] names with English generics
are accepted if this is how the names are used locally.19 [[Mason]], emphasised
that, in her opinion, maps are not a tool for language retention. This comment
contrasts with the [[Nunavut]] experience where, in the Inuit Heritage Trust’s
experience, maps with Inuktitut placenames (as opposed to the more widely
available topographic maps with primarily English-only toponyms) are actively
sought by hunters who tend to communicate with each other over short wave
radio in Inuktitut while “on the land”.
In Alberta, local use dictates the form of the name confirming that English
generics are not automatically added as a matter of course.20

20. Accommodating the Inuit majority: Traditional placenames in [[Nunavut]] today

Alberta’s example is unlike its neighbour to the east, [[Saskatchewan]], which
though it describes itself as “aligned with the Geographic Names Board of
[[Canada]]”, has a similar policy to that of [[Quebec]]. That is, the English generic is
always attached to the [[aboriginal]] name. If a generic is integral to the name, an
English generic would be added. If the generic is separate from the specific,
the [[aboriginal]] generic might be dropped. Here, the provincial names authority
indicated that there is interest in capturing the [[aboriginal]] names and their
meanings but these would appear in a [[database]] and not in the official road signs
or other documentation.
[[Manitoba]]’s policy is similar to that of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Quebec]] in that
placenames always are given an English generic. One exception was noted –
that of a populated place known by the [[aboriginal]] name “Manitou” with no
generic. Incidentally, [[Manitoba]] is also a province with an outspoken [[French]]speaking minority.
[[Ontario]], the most populous province, home to almost 40 per cent of the [[Canadian]]
population has a relatively small First Nations population (less than 2 per cent
of the total population).21
[[Ontario]] accepts [[aboriginal]] generics, as in the case of a recent [[aboriginal]] name
that was approved in [[Ontario]]: Miskwaa Ziibi where the entity type is listed as
River, and the generic in the name itself “Ziibi” means “River”. Therefore the
name – Miskwaa Ziibi – stands on its own without an English or [[French]] generic
in the name itself.22
The Nova Scotia placenames policy stipulates that names should be adopted in
a single language form; this includes a provision allowing the generic term to be
recorded in an [[aboriginal]] language.23
[[New]] [[Brunswick]], in many ways, is just getting started with its Toponymy Office. As
in some of the other provinces names changes are not encouraged. However, First
Nation peoples on reserves in the province may apply to the federal department
of [[Indian]] and [[North]]ern Affairs with a proposal for a new name, a process in place
in all the provinces. [[New]] placenames proposals with demonstrated support and
little or no conflict have a better chance of being accepted.

[[Indigenous]] and Minority Placenames

Inuktitut placenames in the province. The Inuit of Nunatsiavut, a land claim
settlement area within the province of [[New]]foundland and Labrador, number
about 5,500 persons. The actual area covered in the Labrador Inuit Land Claims
Agreement, consists of 28,000 square miles (72,520 km²) of land in Labrador and
17,000 square miles (44,030 km²) of sea. Labrador Inuit do not own this land,
but have special rights related to traditional land use.
With regards to placenames, the Nunatsiavut Land Claim Agreement24 states that
the Nunatsiavut Government will have the exclusive right to establish official
placenames in Labrador Inuit Lands, subject to approval by the responsible
provincial minister. The Government of [[New]]foundland and Labrador must
consult the Nunatsiavut Government on any proposed placenames in the
Settlement Area outside Labrador Inuit Lands.25
In the [[Yukon]], one of [[Canada]]’s three northern territories, [[aboriginal]] names stand
on their own. There are special challenges here as there may be as many as
four First Nations groups that claim a particular area and therefore a feature
might have four [[aboriginal]] names, with the addition perhaps of a fifth non[[aboriginal]] name. The [[Yukon]] Government has a unique format to handle some
of the overlapping First Nations names through a Land Claims Umbrella Final
Agreement (UFA) in which Alternate Placenames are recognised by [[Canada]], but
do not show up on maps and road signs. Worthy of note is that as of [[2003]], the
official name of [[Yukon]] Territory was changed to [[Yukon]], dropping the generic.
The situation in the [[North]]west [[Territories]] is similar to that of the [[Yukon]] but
here the Government of the [[North]]west [[Territories]] insists that as many as seven
[[aboriginal]] names for one feature, the Mackenzie River is a prime example, be
accepted and that [[Ottawa]] (the seat of the federal [[government]]) must figure out
a way to make this work. This act is also in conflict with a [[United]] Nations
principle of univocity, one name for one place. A First Nations leader, guest at
a Geographic Names Board of [[Canada]] meeting in Yellowknife in [[August]] [[2007]],
also expressed that, in naming, the contributions of [[white]] pioneers in [[Canada]]’s
north should not be forgotten. He noted that the traditional names must appear
but the other non-traditional names are also an important part of [[history]].
In terms of trends in toponymy in [[Canada]], a working group of the Geographical
Names Board of [[Canada]] presented a report on Proposed Delineation Guidelines
at its annual members meeting in [[August]] [[2007]]. In this report they noted how
toponymic and topologic perspectives do not necessarily agree and that an
important distinction must be made between the application of a geographical

name based on local usage and the physical extent of a feature. The example
given is of a hydrologist defining a river based on its physical measurements
of its source, length and flow. Local citizens, however, may apply the name to
only a portion of this physical feature. These Delineation Guidelines will be
of assistance to the Inuit Heritage Trust as we struggle to translate the Inuit
concept of a named place to an “acceptable” generic in English when there is
not a perfect fit between language, cultures and world views. When we submit
placenames to the Government for them to be made official, we normally also
submit an electronic map with shape files with named areas delineated. These
new Delineation Guidelines reflect the reality that we are working in.
Finally, a glance in the direction of the Principles, Policies, and Procedures:
Domestic Geographic Names ([[2003]]) for the [[United]] [[States]] as a whole (as opposed
to state by state).
The [[United]] [[States]] Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) does not encourage
changes in official geographic names. However, the USBGN supports the expert
documentation of geographic names derived from [[Native]] [[America]]n languages.
The USBGN recommends the use of generic terms with names derived from
[[Native]] [[America]]n languages that are easily understood by the general public
and are common to the areas in which the names are applied. This policy applies
even though the [[Native]] [[America]]n names may already contain generic elements.
This being said, Louis Yost of the USBGN did express that the Board will
consider applications with no generics. Though it highly recommends English
generics, the USBGN has been asked by native groups to consider names as they
are used locally.26

3. Summarising approaches to generics with
[[aboriginal]] placenames in [[Canada]]
The position of the national authority, the Geographic Names Board of [[Canada]] is
that placenames generics can be in English, [[French]] or in an [[aboriginal]] language.
However, the provinces and territories have the authority for naming decisions
within their jurisdictions and the G[[NBC]] follows the lead of these jurisdictions.
In provinces and territories where there is either a large and/or outspoken
First Nations or Inuit presence, naming authorities are accepting traditional
placenames as they are used locally, without English or [[French]] generics, into

official nomenclature. Three exceptions are [[Manitoba]], [[Saskatchewan]] and
[[Quebec]], though these three appear to be willing to accord visibility to the
[[aboriginal]] names without going all the way to accepting the names as official.
[[Quebec]] has been making efforts to grant visibility to [[aboriginal]] placenames in
their original forms for the benefit of [[aboriginal]] communities. At a meeting of
the Geographic Names Board of [[Canada]] (G[[NBC]]) in [[August]] [[2007]], the Director
of the [[Quebec]] Commission de toponymie, in a teleconference, mentioned to the
assembled group that her office had a received a proposal for 900 [[aboriginal]]
placenames. She wondered openly if anyone else in the country was dealing with
similar volumes of names changes and new names. In fact [[Nunavut]] is leading the
country with proposals for thousands of placenames to be made official.
In the rest of the country, and particularly where First Nations and Inuit
populations are in the majority, such as in the territories north of the 60th
parallel, the trend is towards reverting to [[aboriginal]] placenames and ensuring
that the integrity of these names is not marred by the addition of English and
[[French]] generics and that the names stand as they are in use by local populations.
