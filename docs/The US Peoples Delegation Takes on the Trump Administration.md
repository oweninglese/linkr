The U.S. People’s Delegation Takes on the [[Trump]] Administration
 
______________________________________________________
 
While the [[Trump]] Administration Rolls Back Climate Protections, a “People’s 
Delegation” is at COP23 to Showcase What Climate Leadership Must Look Like
 
Bonn, Germany — Today, community and grassroots leaders from the [[United]] [[States]] 
announced their platform at COP23 called the “U.S. People’s Delegation[4]” to 
counter the [[Trump]] Administration’s fossil fuel agenda and to hold US states, 
cities, businesses, and the public accountable to commitments to [[climate]] action.
The platform, includes youth, [[Indigenous]] peoples, frontline communities, 
advocates, and policymakers who have come to Bonn with organizations from across
the U.S. They have come together to show what [[climate]] leadership should look 
like[5].
 
With the [[Trump]] Administration rolling back [[climate]] protections, expanding fossil
fuel development, ramming through dirty infrastructure, and withdrawing the U.S.
from its commitments to the Paris Climate Agreement, the People’s Delegation and
the organizations involved are taking action to protect communities and isolate 
the Administration by demanding a fossil free future and real [[climate]] action on 
the local level.
 
Among the demands are:
 
 
  * A just and equitable transition to 100% renewable energy in all cities and 
  states.
  * For U.S. elected officials to step up in meaningful ways to ensure bold 
  [[climate]] action in the face of the current Administration’s rollback on [[climate]]
  protections, the persistence of ongoing [[climate]] disasters, and the impact of 
  existing inequalities and [[government]]al negligence on frontline and vulnerable 
  communities.
  * A halt to all new fossil fuel projects, with the understanding that the 
  fossil fuel industry continues to perpetuate the [[climate]] crisis and sow 
  [[climate]] denial, creating a bleak future for generations to come.
  * A call for all nations to increase their ambition, not decrease it. The 
  commitments countries put forward under the Paris Agreement were already too 
  little, too late and would lead to at least 3.5 degrees of warming, not the 
  1.5° and 2° goals enshrined in the agreement. We can’t let the US be an excuse
  for other countries to dial back their action — especially since with cities 
  and states doubling down, the US could be moving forward.
  * A demand to stop negotiating cap-and-[[trade]], carbon offsets, carbon pricing, 
  and other market schemes that avoid cutting pollution at the source.
 
At COP23, while the People’s Delegation is calling for meaningful [[climate]] 
action, the [[Trump]] Administration is pushing coal, natural gas and [[nuclear]] 
energy[6] as an “answer” to [[climate]] change.
 
The organizations represented in the People’s Delegation include: SustainUS, 
Sunrise Movement, [[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network, Global Grassroots Justice 
Alliance, and the Climate Justice Alliance as part of It Takes Roots, U.S Human 
Rights Network, Climate Generation, Our Children’s Trust, NextGen [[America]], and 
350.org[7].
 
Quote List:
 
Varshini Prakash of SustainUS and Sunrise Movement said, “I have seen [[climate]] 
change-fueled floods destroy lives and livelihoods where my family is from in 
India. In southern India, thousands of farmers have committed suicide because of
drought. Within my lifetime, my home in the [[States]] could be underwater if we do 
nothing to stop [[climate]] change. No one should have to live in fear of losing the
people that they love or the places that they come from. I’m going to COP23 as 
part of the People’s Delegation to show that the [[America]]n people are still in, 
that we’re ready to fight back against [[Trump]] and his regressive policies, and 
that we refuse to let wealthy [[[[CEO]]]]s and oil barons lead us down the path of 
destruction.”
 
Dallas Goldtooth of [[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network, part of the It Takes Roots
delegation said,”We head to COP23 as part of [[Indigenous]] Environ[[mental]] Network 
and with the U.S. People’s Delegation to continue the to rise up as [[Indigenous]], 
Black, and Brown communities against extraction, [[colonialism]] and to call for 
real action from elected leaders who have pledged to address [[climate]] change.”
 
Kiran Ooman, a youth plaintiff with Our Children’s Trust said, “Growing up in 
the [[Pacific]] [[North]]west of the [[United]] [[States]] I have witnessed the effects of 
[[climate]] change, from the steady increase in forest fire severity to unnaturally 
high pollen counts. However, my concern also includes the places where my family
live, including India and Florida, where the fatal threat of storms are 
worsening each year. We are working to hold the [[Trump]] Administration accountable
not only for their inaction but also for the actions they are taking, such as 
pushing through new fossil fuel infrastructure and cutting back on environ[[mental]]
regulations, which puts the [[climate]] and all people of the earth in danger. As 
young people, we face the consequences of these actions most acutely, and that’s
why I’m I’m here at COP 23 with the U.S. People’s Delegation: To remind the 
international community that despite our youth we are fighting the unjust 
actions of the US Government, and we need your support in defending our 
futures.”
 
Katia R. Avilés Vázquez of Organización Boricuá, representing the It Takes Roots
delegation said, “Puerto Rico has been the victim of a perfect storm of natural 
weather extremes, fiscal austerity measures, bad management and planning, 
combined with a colonial situation that prevents us from trading and learning 
from our sister islands in the Caribbean region. Along with the Caribbean, 
Puerto Rico was hit by two of the largest hurricanes in recorded [[history]] within 
two weeks of each other in the month of [[September]]. Organización Boricuá has been
working on the frontlines under the most dire conditions of [[colonialism]], 
corruption, and [[climate]] change. We demand a Just Transition.”
 
Dyanna Jaye, representing ICLEI U.S. Local Governments for Sustainability and 
Sunrise Movement said, “Flooding is routine in my coastal Virginia home town; 
our lands are being slowly reclaimed by the [[Atlantic]] Ocean and communities have 
been forced to flee their homes. From monster hurricanes to the wildfires and 
deadly heatwaves in the [[America]]n West, [[2017]] has shown that the threat of [[climate]]
change is now. Yet, [[Trump]] has allied with fossil fuel [[[[CEO]]]]s who are dead set on 
profiting from pollution, including Exxon [[[[CEO]]]] turned Secretary of State, Rex 
Tillerson. They have no right to represent the [[America]]n people. Though [[Trump]] and
his billionaire friends may try to pull us backwards, we, everyday [[America]]ns, 
will keep moving our country forward and make sure our cities, universities, and
states take the action we need to stop [[climate]] change and create good jobs in 
our communities.”
 
Ellen Anderson of Energy Transition Lab, with the Climate Generation delegation 
said,
 
“We are here to let the world know that most [[America]]ns support action on [[climate]]
change, despite what you hear from [[Washington]]. In our state of Minnesota,we are 
leading the way for the Heartland of [[America]], showing that you can cut carbon, 
build out renewable energy, create thousands of good-paying jobs, and save money
by shifting to a clean energy economy. Our Lt. [[Governor]] said to our delegation 
last week that our state is completely committed to this clean energy 
transition, and feels the sense of urgency to move forward faster. Our 
delegation represents academia, educators, and students along with civil 
society, youth, and [[indigenous]] communities, all standing together with the other
nations of the world to support and learn from each other how to tackle this 
existential challenge.”
 
Thanu Yakupitiyage, U.S. Communications Manager and coordination of the U.S. 
People’s Delegation said, “The U.S. People’s Delegation is at COP23 to share 
loud and clear the message that communities back home demand a fast and fair 
transition to a world free of fossil fuels with 100% renewable energy for all. 
350.org is proud to be supporting the work of organizations who were already 
bringing delegations to COP23. Our work collectively as part of the U.S. 
People’s Delegation is aimed at amplifying the urgency of [[climate]] action, 
holding accountable elected officials who have said they will step up against 
the [[Trump]] Administration to ensure they turn their words into action, and 
sharing our stories and solutions from diverse communities. We do not have time 
to waste, we need real [[climate]] action now.”
