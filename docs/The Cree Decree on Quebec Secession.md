The [[Cree]]s want meaningful inclusion in

want to have an effective say in our own

our region, in real partnership with [[Quebec]] [and] with [[Canada]].
In [[Cree]] we have a word for human being
- eeniw. I want the [[Cree]] people and all of
the [[Aboriginal]] peoples to be treated like
human beings. But this must be understood: our conception of our humanity is

that we are a people. To treat us as humans,

not only to the destruction of a priceless
forest that can never be replaced, but also
to the equally savage destruction of something just as priceless - the rule of law, the

These [[[[protest]]s]] in Oregon are just the
beginning. As more people realize what
the Timber Republicans have done, I predict there will be many more such occasions to stand, to bear witness, to be
counted. I invite all of you, comrades and

colleagues who I know also care deeply

about our forests, to consider when the
best occasion will be for you to join us.
