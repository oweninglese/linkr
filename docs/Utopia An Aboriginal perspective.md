NATIONAL: Award winning investigative journalist John Pilger’s new film Utopia 
will be a powerful weapon to raise awareness about [[Aboriginal]] [[Australia]], 
according to Arrente writer Celeste Liddle*.
 
On flicking through the [[UK]] reviews of John Pilger’s new documentary film 
“Utopia”, one thing quickly becomes apparent: Pilger has created a hard-hitting 
film that is of extraordinary importance.
 
Utopia, which was released in the [[UK]] in [[November]], has consistently received rave
reviews. CineVue refers to it as “as an examination of forgotten injustice it’s 
quite simply essential viewing”. Metro states that the film is “confrontational,
eye-opening and saddening viewing”.
 
As someone who has been lucky enough to see the film, I cannot say I am at all 
surprised that four-star ratings have dominated, with the slightly lower ratings
seemingly limited to criticism about the length of the film and Pilger’s 
interruptive and [[bomb]]astic-at-times interview style.
 
It is frequently described as a “must see”, its content as bleak, confronting 
and disturbing and its core arguments as compelling and shameful.
 
In short, since its release, it has shaken viewers in the [[UK]] and awoken them to 
some unspoken truths in this country.
 
That the film may not have the same reaction in [[Australia]] is not a surprise to 
me. The content, after all, covers the appalling situations and vast injustices 
facing many [[Indigenous]] [[Australia]]ns.
 
It’s been historically well-established that these things are not items of 
interest to the majority of people living in this country.
 
Whilst some independent cinemas have come on board to screen Utopia, it looks 
like additional screenings are going to have to be held in places such as 
universities and activist organisations, as well as on SBS TV.
 
In other words, what should be mandatory mainstream viewing about what’s 
happening in the proverbial “backyard”, particularly if people take the 
democratic process of voting seriously, is probably going to end up preaching to
the converted.
 
It’s nothing new that other countries are expressing shock and outrage over this
film, whilst [[Australia]] tries to ignore its content. For further information, 
check out the mounting pile of political denials following reports from visiting
UN officials.
 
It’s a crying shame, because [[Australia]] NEEDS to see this. They need to sit down 
and absorb the realities of the “[[Aboriginal]] situation” and they need to start 
responding if they actually do believe in the “fair go for all” they’re so fond 
of espousing as a core value of this country.
 
They need to start acknowledging the [[history]] and addressing the current issues 
if they do actually believe this country is a place to be proud of.
 
In Utopia, Pilger takes the viewer on a journey through some of the most 
horrible human rights abuses affecting [[Indigenous]] [[Australia]].
 
It’s a journey that started 28 years ago with his film The Secret Country – The 
First [[Australia]]ns Fight Back and Utopia shows that little has changed.
 
Powerfully, at the beginning of the film, Pilger highlights some of the 
exorbitant wealth certain sections of [[Australia]] are currently enjoying to the 
point where they can afford the rent on a $30,000 per week beach-side [[property]].
 
He then takes the viewer to Ampilawatja, where shanties are lodgings and [[kids]] 
have to be bathed under a communal outdoor tap. He juxtaposes the wealthy 
Canberran suburb Barton, named after the orchestrator of the White [[Australia]] 
Policy, with the region of Utopia, the poorest and most disadvantaged in the 
country.
 
Basic services such as sanitation and transport are lacking in Utopia’s 
communities. Trachoma and glue ear are still [[health]] issues running rampant. The 
differences between Barton and Utopia are stark, yet the differences between 
[[1985]] and [[2013]] Utopia are almost non-existent.
 
Pilger then delves into the years of historical denial. The lack of 
acknowledgement of the frontier wars at the [[Australia]]n [[War]] Memorial; the 
demonising of a people to justify the building of an [[empire]]; the “[[history]] wars” 
of the Howard years where actualities got shoved aside for national pride.
 
It’s particularly poignant when Pilger visits a former [[prison]] camp and place of 
torture and murder for [[Aboriginal]] men called “The Quad” on Rottnest Island.
 
He finds this place has been turned into a luxury resort.
 
Ignored historical facts are delivered thick and fast throughout the film and 
each one lands like a punch in the gut, but none more so than the idea that 
[[Australia]]ns just do not want to hear it.
 
White [[Australia]] definitely appears not too keen to hear it, at least.
 
As already mentioned, many appear to think [[Australia]] is a nation to be proud of.
They show this in a scene where Pilger takes a camera down to Circular Quay to 
speak to the flag-shrouded masses there celebrating [[Australia]] Day.
 
As Pilger works his way through the jingoistic hoards asking people whether they
thought [[Aboriginal]] people had a right to be offended regarding the meaning of 
[[Australia]] Day, he is greeted by everything from the perennially boring “we’re 
ALL [[Australia]]ns” to hearing some
of the most enduring stereotypes of the “uncivilised Aborigine”, to being told 
that he’s “full of s**t”. Certainly some realities of the country’s National Day
rain on the parade of the festival-goers and they simply don’t wish to know 
about it.
 
The criticism of the collective [[Australia]]n amnesia and avoidance continues as 
John Pilger delves into black [[death]]s in custody and the im[[prison]]ment rates of 
First Peoples.
 
He shows footage of the final hours of Kwementyaye Briscoe; locked in his [[prison]]
cell as police neglect to seek proper medical assistance.
 
Pilger speaks to the parents of Eddie Murray: a 21 year old man who died in 
custody in [[1981]] by hanging after being arrested for public drunkenness. There 
have been serious doubt cast on this official reasoning for his [[death]] – police 
records had been falsified and there was evidence that there had been cover-ups.
 
That his parents fought for decades and both ended up passing away before seeing
any justice makes this case even more tragic. Eddie’s case was the first one 
examined in the [[1987]] Royal Commission into [[Aboriginal]] Deaths in Custody, yet 
years later these [[death]]s continue with little public outcry or even 
acknowledgement.
 
When the film investigates the installation of the [[North]]ern Territory 
Intervention, the injustice highlighted goes up another notch.
 
The [[ABC]] Lateline report that led to the Howard [[government]] declaring a “state of 
emergency” in the NT was exposed by journalist Chris Graham (formerly Managing 
Editor of Tracker and a contributor) as having fabricated stories and falsified 
documents; using old and inaccurate footage in some cases to construct their 
untruths.
 
The findings from police departments,the Central [[Australia]]n Specialists, the 
[[Australia]]n Crime Commission and other experts that there was little to no 
evidence to support the claims made by the Lateline programme and the then 
[[government]] has not caused public outcry. Six years after the Intervention was 
instituted and the Racial Discrimination Act (RDA) suspended to bring the policy
in, the Intervention continues, albeit in a modified form.
 
There are two huge points Pilger investigates through this section of the film.
 
One is that the greater [[Australia]]n public has been more than happy to accept the
intervention because they readily accept horrible and racist stereotypes of 
[[Aboriginal]] people as fact.
 
Another is that when it comes to a country generating billions of dollars worth 
of income through the [[mining]] of its mineral resources, the demonisation of 
[[Indigenous]] [[Australia]] is a small price to pay.
 
It’s almost completely impossible to deny the truth of Pilger’s assertions here.
Pilger has already so poignantly highlighted many layers of [[Australia]]n [[racism]] by
this point, and has juxtaposed this [[racism]] with wealth generation repeatedly.
 
Indeed, the continual spectre of the [[mining]] industry looms throughout the film.
 
The diminishing of land rights by [[government]]s and the fear campaigns that have 
been run by the media are highlighted.
 
Taxes upon [[mining]] and the resources that these funds could have injected into 
severely disadvantaged [[Indigenous]] communities are shown as being vehemently 
opposed by some of the wealthiest and powerful [[mining]] magnates in the country.
 
Mining interests have continually been at loggerheads with the interests of 
traditional owners, and at the end of the day, the magnates have almost always 
won.
 
Most [[Australia]]ns have remained apathetic to the reality that whilst Gina 
Rinehart earns almost $1 million every 30 minutes on natural resources in this 
land, [[Australia]] remains the only first world nation to not have eradicated 
trachoma.
 
Indeed, the minority [[government]] formed in [[2010]] by the ALP following the toppling
of Kevin Rudd from leadership suggests that, in part, [[Australia]]ns felt taxing 
[[mining]] [[companies]] was actually a bad thing. That the media continually pumped 
this information through to the voting public is undeniable. When it boils down 
to it, a fairer distribution of wealth, particularly for [[Indigenous]] [[Australia]], 
is not a consideration for a population who are conditioned to think that black 
[[Australia]] already get too much.
 
Pilger also delves into the Stolen Generations and how they are continuing today
via the high rates of removal of [[Aboriginal]] [[kids]] by [[government]] authorities. The 
Apology given by former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in [[2008]] is revisited and Rudd 
emulates the Artful Dodger when asked why things have not improved and why 
compensation was denied to members of the Stolen Generations and their families 
immediately following The Apology.
 
Pilger’s final argument; that a [[treaty]] with [[Indigenous]] [[Australia]] needs to happen
is a very poignant note to end on. I particularly commend him for this.
 
In an endless and well-funded campaign for Constitutional Recognition, which to 
me is a form of “practical reconciliation”, the point that it’s not a true 
negotiation and redistribution for the proper benefit of black [[Australia]] needs 
to be made.
 
What will truly change if black [[Australia]] is merely written into a coloniser 
document, and why is it considered so important at this point in time for this 
to happen? Why was a [[treaty]] on the table in the [[1980]]s yet is not being talked 
about now when we are told so frequently that many gains have been made?
 
Pilger doesn’t even mention Constitutional Recognition and I can only garner 
from this that he, like so many of us in the community, has reservations 
regarding this push and cannot see what the true benefit of it will be beyond 
yet another symbolic gesture.
 
Throughout the film, you see Pilger completely setting politicians and other 
officials on the back foot when questioned on how they have dealt with 
[[Aboriginal]] issues, and the few gains that have been made.
 
You see medical practitioners, journalists and [[research]]ers highlight the many 
miscarriages of justice and human rights abuses that have been inflicted 
particularly on the most vulnerable members of the community.
 
You see Pilger bring the evidence of all this to the table over and over again 
for the audience to ruminate upon.
 
Yet here’s the rub for me: as an [[Aboriginal]] woman in this country, very little 
of what he has presented to me is information I did not already know. Nor would 
it be information a fair chunk of black [[Australia]] wouldn’t know. It’s affected 
our families, it’s denied our heritage, it’s been right there in front of us our
entire lives. We know it because it is a part of us.
 
This is why I have little sympathy when I see opinion pieces criticising John 
Pilger for releasing this film to the [[UK]] before [[Australia]] because they feel that
this is an [[Australia]]n story and it needs to be discussed here first.
 
The evidence has been there for [[Australia]]ns for a very long time, and 
[[Australia]]ns have chosen; through socially-embedded [[racism]]; through personal 
greed; through manufactured national pride, to ignore it over and over again.
 
If Utopia causes outrage in other parts of the world and casts a very stern 
global spotlight on [[Australia]] with regards to the situations facing [[Indigenous]] 
[[Australia]], then perhaps this might actually lead to some more positive outcomes 
for a change.
 
We can only hope.
