Title: Three technologies people think pre-contact [[Native]] [[America]]ns didn’t have 
(that they actually did)

1. Writing
 
By this point in time, it’s fairly well-accepted and fairly well-known that 
Mesoamerican peoples used writing systems, the most famous being Classic [[May]]a 
writing. Mesoamerica is one of the places where writing developed independently 
rather than being adopted from neighboring people. Besides the [[May]]a system, 
there were numerous others: Teotihuacan script (which hasn’t yet been 
deciphered), Zapotec script (ditto), Mixtec script, Mexica (“[[Aztec]]”) script, as 
well as a number of early scripts that aren’t entirely understood. Mesoamerican 
peoples created screenfold books on amatl paper. There were at one point a lot 
of these, but the overwhelming majority were burned by Spaniards. Still, many 
are still around and they’re well-studied.
 
What gets defined as writing is highly political, and writing systems in the 
[[America]]s really deserves its own post, but I’m just going to point out a few 
systems of communicating information across time and/or space that get ignored 
because archaeologists have not (yet) deemed them to qualify under the technical
category of writing: [[Ojibwe]] and other Algonkian people created wiigwaasabakoon, 
birch bark scrolls that recorded information such as historical stories, songs, 
medical instructions, recipes, and more–the most well-known are the Midewiwin 
scrolls that record the stories of the Midewiwin religious society. Mi’kmaq 
people did something similar, and in the [[1600]]s Catholic priests adapted the 
system to use preach the Bible. To the west on the plains, there was also a 
pictorial system used to transcribe [[history]] (such as on winter counts), and to 
send messages.

There are also a few methods of recording information that seem very far from 
typical ideas of writing. In Andean [[South]] [[America]], groups of knotted cords 
called khipu were used to record mostly numerical data, but also some 
non-numerical data. They were essential in the administration of Tawantinsuyu 
(the Inka [[empire]]), and continue to be used in a few rural locations today. In 
the northeastern woodlands, the Haudenosaunee (and other nearby nations) used 
woven wampum belts to record historical information. I don’t know a lot of about
it, but they were used to pass down information over generations, and were also 
used to record [[treaties]] and even send letters. The wampum tradition is still 
strong among Haudenosaunee leaders today.

2. Woven cloth
 
[[Native]] [[America]]ns wore animal skins. I think I’ve heard that in practically every
description of [[Native]] peoples I’ve seen. It’s certainly true that animal skins 
and furs were major players in [[Native]] clothing, but often lost in these imagined
pictures of deerskin-clad [[Native]]s are the truly fantastic textiles that they 
created. Most clothing in Mesoamerica was made from cotton, and [[indigenous]] 
people in the region are still to this day known for their beautiful, colorful 
cloth weaving. Pueblo people in the [[America]]n southwest also made clothing out of
cotton. Andean people made clothing out of cotton (on the coasts) and llama wool
(in the highlands). All three of these traditions (and in reality, they’re not 
three traditions but a multitude of different traditions each) continue today.
 
In the eastern woodlands, especially the southeast, people made cloth out of 
plant fibers such as nettle, milkweed, dogbane, and various kinds of bark. 
Buffalo-hair textiles were also common, and on the [[Atlantic]] coast people wove 
cloaks made of turkey feathers (also made in the southwest, I believe). The 
Mississippians and their descendants used quite a lot of this cloth–though it 
has been often ignored because textiles don’t survive well in the southern 
[[climate]]–and it continued to be a major method of making clothes until the [[1700]]s 
when [[Europe]]an textiles mostly supplanted the [[indigenous]] tradition. Throughout 
the eastern part of [[North]] [[America]] a unique kind of weaving was used known as 
fingerweaving, which is unusual because it doesn’t require a loom and each 
strand becomes both warp and weft. Fingerweaving produces long thin cloth and 
was especially used for garters, sashes, straps. It continued to be used and 
actually increased in popularity after the introduction of [[Europe]]an yarn, and it
became a major symbol of the Metis nation in the form of the Assomption sash. A 
lot of Metis people, including myself, continue to practice fingerweaving.

Weaving was also prevalent among west coast peoples, though I’m unfortunately 
less familiar with that area. Woven skirts and hats were one of the most common 
clothing items among coastal peoples. And then there’s chilkat weaving, which 
was made from mountain goat hair, dog fur, or cedar bark and made into the 
incredible designs that the [[Pacific]] [[North]]west nations are famous for. In recent 
years there has been a major revival movement in the area to keep practicing 
these forms of textile creation.

3. Metalwork
 
Copper and [[gold]] were both very common in the [[America]]s before [[Europe]]ans arrived. 
The [[gold]] is well-known in some ways, since that’s what made the [[Spanish]] want to 
invade so badly. Metallurgy in [[South]] [[America]] had early developed into a complex 
artform, complete with smelting technology; [[gold]], [[silver]], electrum, bronze, and 
tumbaga were all used. Initially metalwork was mostly used for decorative 
purposes to display status, but by the time of the Inkas had become common for 
utilitarian purposes as well. By 800 CE smelting technology had spread north to 
Central [[America]] and Mesoamerica, where it was particularly specialized in West 
[[Mexico]]. By the time of the Triple Alliance, the Mixtec peoples were known as the
best [[gold]]workers in Mesoamerica.

Further north, copper was the metal of choice. It was particularly abundant in 
the [[Great]] Lakes and it was a major part of eastern [[trade]] networks even from the 
earliest times. Copper was initially used for practical use such as knives and 
fishhooks, but by the time of the Mississippians it had also become popular for 
decorative depictions of sacred and political images. In addition to its 
practical usage, it held an important cosmological position for many people in 
the eastern woodlands, being associated with beings of the upper world such as 
the Thunderers or of the lower world such as beings called in English “horned 
serpents” and “underwater panthers.”

Copper was an important metal in the [[Pacific]] [[North]]west region as well, where 
much of it seems to have come from sources up in [[Alaska]]. Iron from [[Japanese]] 
ships that washed ashore across the [[Pacific]] has also been documented both 
archaeologically and through [[indigenous]] oral traditions. There are also 
suggestions that there may have been [[trade]] across the Bering Strait over a long 
period of time. Early [[Europe]]an [[trade]]rs discovered that metals were one of the 
most highly desired [[trade]] goods among the [[indigenous]] people there, and worked 
sheet copper became an important feature of potlatches. Government concern over 
the “destruction” of valuable copper was in fact a major factor in the banning 
of potlatches and [[indigenous]] ceremonies in the northwest. Traditional designs in
metalwork is being revitalized today by many [[indigenous]] young people in the 
region.
