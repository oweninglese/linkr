that

Following on from my article about why I prefer the term "black"[1], I 
encountered what I can only describe as an unexpected and actually quite 
upsetting response via Twitter. It was unexpected because it came from members 
of the migrant community; a community which, on the most part, I have 
experienced as strong allies. It was upsetting because no amount of explanation 
from an Indigenous perspective seemed to satisfy. There was a barrow to be 
pushed and it needed to be pushed at all costs. I write this piece not to cause 
division, but rather to use this opportunity to educate in the hope that the 
knowledge of people is expanded. 
 
It started as an initial long Tweet that I was sent, but from there it developed
into a long twitter exchange. At no point throughout this exchange did I get the
sense that any of the points I had raised from an Indigenous perspective were 
taken on board. This long tweet, minus identification and lead-in paragraph is 
below: 
 
You've made some comments that indicate that you regard it as ‘old fashioned’ or
‘wrong’ to use skin colour as a marker of race. However, if you deny skin colour
as a marker of race, then you deny an important aspect of Blackness.
 
Being darker doesn't make you more Black, but it does make you, all other things
being equal, more discriminated against. To deny that is to deny your privilege:
not privilege of class, education or profession, but privilege of skin colour.
 
There are countless different ways to be Black and not all of them are visible. 
But denying visibility in Blackness reminds me of whites who claim to be 
colour-blind. In doing so, they deny other people’s experience.
 
I think the reason why this means so much to me is that I have no shared 
culture, no shared history, no shared community or any of what you consider to 
be contemporary or valid Blackness. Just skin colour. 
 
Now before I go further, it should be highlighted that my article, which was 
completely about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander identity, and which used 
many of our descriptive terms, our language and our experience to highlight this
fact was interpreted, as was made clear in the residual tweets, to have impact 
for non-Indigenous communities of colour. I never set out to represent these 
viewpoints in my piece. I do not have the required background to represent these
views from a first-hand experience. Considering that our media is dominated by 
white males writing about everyone else, I would much rather read those 
perspectives first-hand rather than silence the voices by hazarding guesses at 
what their views might be. Likewise, I expect that people would recognise that I
am coming from the perspective of an educated Arrernte woman of the hard-left 
persuasion who lives in the city, recognise how rare those voices are in the 
media, and not contribute to the silencing. It was unfortunate that this didn't 
happen.
 
To start with the point regarding how skin colour is a racial marker and there 
is a privilege associated with lighter skin, I didn't deny this in my responses 
although I tried to highlight from an Indigenous perspective why the situation 
was more complicated. I just got walls. This was why I ended up putting a stop 
to the conversation. To put it simply, I don't disagree with Dallas Scott[2] 
when he highlights how skin colour seems to be associated with greater financial
disadvantage, lower educational attainment and social ostracism, although I 
would argue that factors such as remoteness and mainstream ignorance also come 
into play. I'm 100% certain that skin colour was the reason why Jack Charles and
Gurrumul Yunupingu[3] were denied taxis. Their visibility is undeniable. 
 
However, fair skin privilege from an Indigenous perspective is incredibly 
limited. The view expressed by the long tweet completely ignores the many 
assimilation practices that fairer skinned Aboriginal people have been exposed 
to in this country, such as the "Stolen Generations"[4]. Children of fairer skin
being ripped away from their darker parents in order to be trained up in 
domestic chores and farmhand duties so they could then be given to settler 
communities as free labour.

Fair skinned children being blackened up with charcoal by the parents in the 
hope that the government officers would not notice their colouring. Children 
being belted for speaking their language and forced to abandon language, culture
and family in order to avoid punishment. Living conditions so abhorrent that a 
dog would turn it's nose up at them. Don't believe me? Here is my grandmother, 
who was a member of the Stolen Generations, talking about the experience in her 
own words[6]. It didn't end with my grandmother either. My father was a welfare 
kid who ended up with some siblings in The Convent School in Alice Springs where
they were also punished severely for expressing language and culture. Recently 
my brother, at my father's birthday, delivered a speech where he gave the first 
paragraph in Arrernte. I cannot not tell you how that felt. For two generations 
children in my family were denied the right to speak language because they were 
wards of the state and here's my brother, at nearly 30 years old, reclaiming 
this language so that his siblings and his son are not also denied it. It's for 
these reasons that you see so many fairer skinned Aboriginal people fighting so 
damn hard to reclaim language, family and culture. By virtue of skin colour many
were denied these things. This is not an experience within the borders of this 
country that translates readily to a migrant experience. 
 
Additionally, whilst I never denied skin colour as a marker, and whilst I also 
don't deny the existence of some fair skin privilege in the some ways, what 
about visiting the concept of "migrant privilege"? The White Australia Policy 
existed until the early 1980s yet from the 1940s onwards, following the impacts 
of wars, it was chipped away at bit by bit. Non-white immigrants were eventually
accepted into the country in various "waves" to the point of Malcolm Fraser[7] 
openly supporting multiculturalism and opening up the refugee programmes to many
Asian nations. This country has gone so far backward since this time with 
elections being won on the basis of "stopping the boats" that I am disgusted to 
live in it. Yet, here's the thing: my father, despite being born in this country
and having ancestors that had been born in this country for roughly 4000 
generations, was not counted in the census as a citizen of this country until he
was 17 years old. This is why I have problems with the term "First Australians".
Each successive wave of immigrants became Australians before the First Peoples, 
regardless of skin colour, were recognised as human beings. Therefore, migrant 
communities, whilst actively discriminated against by other Australians and 
enduring vast poverty, racism, ostracism and countless other things, also had 
more rights in this country than the First Peoples. 
 
I state this not to be inflammatory. Rather it is a simple historical fact and 
one I believe that the majority of people living in this country are unaware of.
They are not aware that one of the wealthiest countries in this world has third 
world conditions tucked away far from the visible eye. They are not aware that 
trachoma and other third world diseases are still an issue here. They are not 
aware and I am not surprised. Why? Because this country continually fails to 
acknowledge its own history and even goes to the extent of suppressing it by 
referring to the negatives as "black armband history"; therefore there is no 
value for national pride to revisit this stuff. Everyone who lives here benefits
from stolen lands for which treaties are yet to be negotiated, massacres, 
frontier wars, assimilation policies and the displacement of original peoples. 
Including Indigenous peoples that live on lands other than homelands (yep, this 
would be me). Yet the broader knowledge of this is so severely lacking. 
Sometimes a simple acknowledgement is all that it takes to make the day of an 
Indigenous person struggling for recognition. 
 
One final point, throughout the course of the tweeting, the dissenting voices 
referred to themselves as "Black Australians" and I feel the need to claim 
sovereignty here. To me this was no different than seeing Andrew Bolt referring 
to himself as an "indigenous Australian". It diminishes our importance as First 
Peoples of this country. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are the "Black 
Australians". Migrants of colour are black people who have made Australia their 
home and have become "Australians" therefore accepting this country as it 
stands: a place which was wrongfully declared Terra Nullius[8] and was taken 
without the consent of the First Peoples. There is a difference. We use "black" 
as a way of highlighting our experiences as a result of, or in contrast to 
"White Australia". The lack of general population knowledge due to national 
denial when it comes to our unique struggles is why I feel that this distinction
is sometimes unknown and needs to be explained. 
 
I wish to apologise to the many comrades and allies I have within the migrant 
communities for the existence of this blogpost. Know how much I value you, your 
support and your commitment to fighting side-by-side for recognition in this 
country. This is not a blogpost that is written for you. Rather it is written 
for others who, sometimes through no fault of their own, do not possess this 
knowledge. Who would make comments such as encountered above without realising 
just how limited and uneducated on the plight of First Peoples these comments 
are. Who accept this country as their home with a dominant power to struggle 
against for recognition yet fail to delve into intricacies of the experiences of
First Peoples. I hope this post assists in their acquisition of knowledge.
 
Finally, I look very much forward to reading more about the experiences of 
migrant communities in this country. I want to read a hell of a lot more about 
the unique experiences of racism, the ostracism and the intricacies from these 
voices. I WANT to read about skin colour and how this manifests as a site of 
repression from a migrant perspective. If I had my way, the dominant white, 
middle-class, right-wing male voices would be sidelined in the media in favour 
for diversity and the sharing of true knowledges. I will never, however, be 
representing these voices myself in my writings. As First Peoples whose 
experience is almost always denied, we've got our own stories to tell and I am 
not the right person to be telling the stories of others. With respect.

Update 11/4/14 - Earlier this week, a response was written by the original 
poster[9] of the long tweet that started all this. On reading this post, beyond 
linking it so people do know a response was prepared, I have decided no further 
response from me is warranted. The piece speaks for itself and I would be 
clearly wasting my time furthering this exchange, and a couple of parallel 
exchanges with others. Among many other "interesting" points made, it's news to 
me that I want anyone to accept this country as it is, what with me being a 
[[sovereignty]] supporter and all... Anyway, make of it what you will.
 
Update 14/4/14 (what I hope will be the final one) - Eugenia Flynn has written a
response[10] to this whole situation, and I encourage all to read it. It's 
incredibly important and not only reflects her own proximity to this issue but 
came about because, despite all efforts, things didn't appear to be letting up 
any time soon and myths were continuing to be perpetuated by those with a barrow
to push to achieve their own notoriety (my words, not hers). It is an 
extraordinary piece and I want to thank her publicly for taking the time to 
articulate her views. I hope that those with unanswered questions will find them
within her articulate text. I have previously stated that no further response 
from me is warranted, and whilst there was a further response given on me 
stating this (available via the link in the first edit if you click on the main 
site), it is unproductive to engage with that response post or any subsequent as
I have no doubt they will continue. Fiction is fast becoming "fact" and I'm not 
willing to be a part of that.
