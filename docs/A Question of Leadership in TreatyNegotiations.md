CHIEFS AND PRINCIPAL MEN:
A QUESTION OF LEADERSHIP
IN TREATY NEGOTIATIONS X

Abstract: During the 19th century, [[treaties]] were negotiated with
[[Indian]] people in [[Canada]] to extinguish their interests in vast areas of
land prior to settlement by non-natives. Government [[representative]]s
assumed that chiefs and principal men who signed these [[treaties]] repre
sented all bands living in [[treaty]] areas, and that signers had the authority
to negotiate on behalf of their bands. However, ethnohistorical analysis

suggests that this assumption was not necessarily valid, and that the
concept of leadership in the context of [[treaty]] negotiations needs to be
re-examined. Circumstances surrounding the Robinson Superior [[Treaty]]
of [[1850]] are used to explore this issue.

Resume: Au cours du XIXe siecle, les traites etaient negocies avec les
amerindiens du [[Canada]] dans le but d'eliminer leurs interets dans de
vastes territoires avant les reglements avec les non-autochtones. Les
representants du gouvernement assumaient que les chefs et les princi
paux peronnages qui avaient signe ces traites representaient toutes les
bandes habitant la region concernee et assumaient aussi que les signa
taires avaient l'autorite de negocier pour leurs bandes. Quoiqu'il en
soit, l'analyse ethnohistorique suggere que cette presupposition n'etait
pas necessairement justifiee et que le concept de leadership dans le con
texte des negociations d'un traite demande a etre reexamine. C'est en
tout cas ce que laisse entendre les circonstances entourant le ? Robinson
Superior [[Treaty]] ? de [[1850]].

Introduction
The [[treaties]] that were signed during the 19th century by the native people liv
ing in what is now [[Canada]] were negotiated by a named [[representative]], or rep
resentatives, of the [[British]] [[Crown]] and certain individuals who are referred to

in the [[treaty]] documents as "principal men," "principal chiefs, [[warrior]]s and
people" or "chiefs and principal men" of a particular group. The wording of
these [[treaties]], the circumstances surrounding their negotiation and, in general,

the subsequent relationships between [[government]] and the respective [[Indian]]
groups indicate that the [[government]] [[representative]]s dealt with the chiefs and

principal men who participated in the [[treaty]] negotiations as if they repre
sented all the [[Indian]] people living in the [[treaty]] areas and had the authority to
negotiate on their behalf in much the same way that the [[government]] repre
sentatives negotiated on behalf of the [[British]] [[Crown]]. However, the following
ethnohistorical analysis of [[treaty]] negotiations suggests that those assumptions
were based on an incomplete understanding of the sociopolitical organization
of [[Indian]] groups at the time of these negotiations.

Anthropological [[research]] has shown that leadership in band societies is
not formalized and, in fact, different kinds of leaders are afforded recognition

by group consensus as circumstances warrant. Traditional roles are affected
by prolonged contact with [[Europe]]an society, either resulting in changes in
existing leadership roles or acting as a catalyst for the appearance of new
roles that are contemporaneous to, but distinct from, the traditional ones. Lee
refers to this phenomenon as the contradiction between "inside" leaders and

"outside" leaders ([[1982]]:50).
"Inside" and "outside" leaders are discernible among Ojibwa bands
living on the north shore of Lake Superior in the mid-19th century. The tradi
tional forms of leadership ? hunting group leader and band chief ? were still
present and the fur [[trade]] had provided an opportunity for a new leadership
role to appear, that of trading post band chief. He was, as his title suggests,
attached to a trading post and was credited by the [[trade]]r with having consid

erable authority over the members of the trading post band (Rogers [[1965]]). As

an "outside" leader, the trading post band chief was noted for his ability to
deal with non-natives and was highly regarded by them, but the status thus
afforded him was not necessarily recognized by all the members of the trad
ing post band, nor did his authority extend to activities outside the trading

post.
The events surrounding one 19th-century [[treaty]], the Robinson Superior

[[Treaty]] of [[1850]], indicate that trading post band chiefs were heavily repre
sented among the "chiefs and principal men" who participated in the [[treaty]]

negotiations. While this suggests that they were selected to represent the
[[Indian]]s precisely because they were "outside" leaders, the related issues ?
by whom they were selected, what the extent of their authority was, and
which groups they represented ? remain to be dealt with.

To address these issues, information concerning leadership among the

Lake Superior Ojibwa during the early to mid-19th century has been
extracted from the observations and records left by fur [[trade]]rs, explorers and

[[government]] [[representative]]s. These sources are frequently ethnocentric but
they provide a means, when combined with general anthropological theory
concerning band societies, whereby anthropologists and ethnohistorians can
attempt to reconstruct the nature of leadership among these people. In addi

tion, I have relied upon the [[research]] done by Rogers ([[1965]], [[1978]], [[1983]]),

Rogers and Black ([[1976]]), Rogers and Taylor ([[1981]]), Dunning ([[1974]]), [[Bishop]]

([[1974]]), and Ritzenthaler ([[1978]]). Although these authors did not deal

specifically with the Lake Superior Ojibwa, I believe that their observations
are applicable when the general features of leadership that they identified are
supplemented here with the ethnographic information contained in the writ
ings of Hudson's [[Bay]] Company ([[HBC]]) employees in the Lake Superior Dis
trict. The [[trade]]rs' observations are drawn from the period ten to thirty years
prior to the [[treaty]] in [[1850]], since the journals from the Lake Superior posts ?
Fort William, Pic, Michipicoten, Nipigon and Long Lake ? for the period
immediately prior and subsequent to the [[treaty]] have been misplaced or con
tain very little ethnographic material.

Socioeconomic Conditions in the Mid-19th Century
The Lake Superior Ojibwa were hunters, fishermen and gatherers organized
on the principles of band society. A band was composed of hunting groups
(usually extended families) that were scattered throughout the band's terri
tory for most of the year. These hunting groups joined together, usually only
during the spring and fall months, when resources were sufficient to support a

larger number of people in one location, such as a productive fishery. These
gatherings, which often occurred at or near a trading post, were occasions for

visiting, ceremonial events and arranging marriages, because the hunting
groups that formed a band were widely scattered and did not have regular
contact with each other throughout most of the year.

When the Robinson Superior [[Treaty]] was negotiated, the Lake Superior
Ojibwa were in what Rogers and Black ([[1976]]) refer to as the fish and hare
period, although they may have been dependent upon small game for many
years prior to the mid-19th century. Alexander Henry spent the winter of
[[1767]] at Michipicoten and noted, perhaps with some exaggeration, that:
such is the inhospitality of the country over which they [the [[Indian]] people]
wander that only a single family can live together in the winter season, and this
sometimes seeks subsistence in vain on an area of five hundred square miles.
They can stay in one place only till they have destroyed all its hares, and when

these fail they have no resource but in the leaves and shoots of trees, or in
defect of these in cannibalism. (Quaife [[1931]]:206)

The large game animals ? moose and caribou ? had all but disappeared, and
fish and small game animals, particularly rabbits, were relied on for subsis
tence to a much greater extent than had been the case when large game ani

mals were abundant. The effects of this change in subsistence strategy are

richly documented in the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company's post journals and
[[trade]]rs' correspondence. The [[trade]]rs were concerned about the [[Indian]]s' wel
fare, not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because the scarcity of game

animals affected the economics of the fur [[trade]].

Chief Factor John Haldane stated in his [[1824]] report for the Fort William

District that:

formerly there were Moose & Deer ? at this time not one is to be seen being
literally extinct. Caribou was also at a former period, and not a great many
years since, very numerous. Few now are seen ? the scarcity of these Animals
is greatly felt by the [[Indian]]s. In Winter their sole dependence for Subsistence is

on Rabbits [illegible] & Partridges of various kinds. In the Summer and Fall,
the [[Indian]]s are furnished with Nets & in the Fall they are supplied with a good
Stock of Ammunition and notwithstanding these supplies they are often neces
sitated to have recourse to the establishment where we give them fish, potatoes
& [[indian]] [[corn]]. Humanity and interest compel us to be kind to them, & they are
generally grateful to us. (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.231/e/l)

Conditions were so precarious in [[January]] and [[February]] (the coldest months)

that, according to Chief Trader Roderick McKenzie's [[1828]]-[[1829]] report for
Fort William, "two thirds of the poor [[Indian]]s must abandon their lands and

resort to this establishment [Fort William] for subsistence" (Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company Archives b.231/e/6).
Chief Trader [[Donald]] Mcintosh described the socioeconomic conditions
of the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s in his [[1828]] Pic District Report. He wrote
that:
they are divided into Bands [i.e., hunting groups] of one or two families at
most during the winter, they cannot form into large Bands [i.e., bands proper]
because it would be impossible to find subsistence. Altho their lands abounds
in Rabbits on which they depend for food during the winter season, yet they
require a large extent of ground to support a small number of people, as they
destroy these animals in one spot they have to remove to another spot, in con
sequence of which they go over a vast extent of ground in one season. Those

who have families are occupied chiefly during that season in snarring those
animals [rabbits] in order to supply themselves & family with food, hence it is
only Fall and Spring that they can attend to the hunting of those animals with

whose skins they pay their debts. (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives
B.162/e/l)

In [[1834]], Thomas McMurray, who was in charge of Pic Post, stated that
the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s "are hard pushed sometimes to procure a live
lihood [because] their hunting grounds are so circumscribed, and utterly des
titute of Large Animals" with the exception of bears. Consequently, they
depended on rabbits in the winter and were often forced to leave "a good
Martin country to go where Rabbit are plenty," since the two species prefer
different habitats. This was, according to McMurray, often "the cause of a
failure in their [fur] hunts, as best part of their Time is taken up to procure a
Subsistence" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.162/e/4).

The [[Indian]]s who frequented the Nipigon post may have fared somewhat
better than those in the adjacent areas. Although there were "reindeer [cari
bou]" in the area to the west of Lake Nipigon, they were so few in number
that they contributed little to the [[Indian]]s' subsistence. However, fish was
abundant and generally available throughout the year unlike other areas such
as Long Lake, where the fishery was not productive during the winter. Rabbit
was also a mainstay during the winter, as at other posts. The Nipigon Post
Journals contain very few references to "starving [[Indian]]s" in comparison to
other Lake Superior post journals. In [[January]], [[1838]], when an [[Indian]] came to
the Nipigon post to "beg" some fish, claiming that he and his family were
starving, the [[trade]]r noted in his journal that this was "almost unheard of in
this quarter" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.149/e/2, B.149/a/20).
Defined hunting territories were well developed at this time although
incidents of trespass in pursuit of beaver pelts were recorded by the [[trade]]rs.
In [[1829]], George Keith, Chief Factor at Michipicoten, noted that "altho fam
ily territorial divisions seem to be long established and cherished they are
very prone to poach upon anothers hunting grounds and the Beaver ... often
falls a prey to such depredation which sometimes occasions dangerous feuds
between families" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.129/e/6). Ten years
later in [[1839]], Keith recorded in his journal that one of the Michipicoten
[[Indian]]s arrived with his fall hunt and complained about a Pic [[Indian]] who
"poached upon his hunting grounds and [[kill]]ed some Beaver" (Hudson's [[Bay]]

Company Archives B.129/a/20). Government commissioners Vial and
Anderson, relying on the information provided by Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
[[trade]]rs, reported in [[1849]] that by "long established custom," the north shore

of Lake Superior was divided "among several bands [trading post bands]
each independent of the others, having its own chief or chiefs and possessing
an exclusive right to and control over its own hunting grounds ? the limits of
these grounds especially the frontages on the Lake are generally well known

and acknowledged by neighboring bands" (Public Archives of [[Canada]]
RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]16-55).
In [[1828]], [[Donald]] Mcintosh made the following observations about the
condition of the beaver population in the vicinity of Pic Post and the Lake
Superior District in general:
It is evident from the small proportion of Beaver that the District produces that

these animals are nearly destroyed and from the circumstance of having
encouraged the natives ... to hunt the country on the frontiers as much as pos
sible, it is not likely that they will increase; for near the Borders of the Lake
[Superior] and for a considerable distance inland, there is not a Beaver to be

seen. (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.162/e/l)

Beaver returns remained low for the Lake Superior District, throughout the

mid-19th century. Since beaver was the most valuable fur, the economics of
the fur [[trade]] precipitated these numerous incidents of trespassing to hunt bea

ver.

Although there were a small number of people, mainly older men and
widowed women, who remained at or in the immediate vicinity of a post year
round, for most of the year the [[Indian]]s did not appear at the posts in large
numbers or in any grouping remotely resembling a band. Instead, individual

hunters, frequently accompanied by one or more sons or sons-in-law, occa
sionally by a wife (wives) and dependents, made periodic visits to the posts
during the year to [[trade]] their furs or to pick up supplies on credit. The num
ber of times that these [[representative]]s of individual hunting groups appeared
at a post was a function of the distance they had to travel to and from their
hunting grounds or fishing stations. It was usually only during the spring or

fall when hunting groups, referred to as so-and-so's "band" or "family,"

collected at the posts in any numbers, having come from their winter hunting
grounds or fall fishing stations to [[trade]] their furs or to provision themselves
for the winter. However, it was not uncommon for these groups to come to
the post in [[January]] and [[February]], the coldest months of the year, when their

hunting returns were poor and "beg" food from the [[trade]]r to alleviate their
"starving" condition. Spring and fall gatherings at the trading post brought

together the hunting groups of the several bands that frequented the area and
formed the collectivity known as a trading post band. These gatherings would
have been social occasions for feasting, visiting and arranging marriages, and

would have served to enhance the cohesiveness of the trading post band.
Those who stayed at the post year-round or who appeared on a fairly regular
basis were often employed planting or harvesting potato gardens, cutting hay
to feed the post's livestock during the winter, fishing and hunting to provision

the post, manufacturing snowshoes, canoes, and boats, and freighting the

mail and supplies to other posts (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives
B.129/a/l-22, B.117/a/l-12, B.162/a/l-ll, B149/a/l-23).

The Nature of Leadership

The seasonal aggregation and dispersion of a band and the periodic meeting
of a trading post band provided opportunities for a new leadership role to
develop while the traditional roles were still operative. The trading post chief

was, because of his association with the trading post, more visible to the
[[trade]]rs than the traditional leaders ? hunting group headman and band
chief ? whose in[[flu]]ence was felt away from the post. The trading post chief's

sphere of in[[flu]]ence was probably restricted to the activities of the post and it
seems unlikely that his authority would have been recognized away from the

post, when the trading post band split up into hunting groups, by a group
much larger than his own hunting group.
Within a hunting group, the senior male member was most often recog

nized as headman of the group. His leadership was based on his age, knowl
edge and s[[kill]]s as a hunter, perhaps also on his reputation as a shaman, and he

fulfilled his role as leader through his ingenuity, personality and his enjoy
ment of the group's approval. On those occasions when the band's hunting
groups collected, its members recognized the leadership of a single individual

headman, a chief whose role as leader was weaker than that of a hunting
group headman and who was recognized only until the band dispersed once
again. A chiefs authority was based on his age, his oratorical s[[kill]]s and his
ability to act as an arbitrator among band members and, following contact,

between them and [[Europe]]ans. Since the Lake Superior Ojibwa spent most of

the year scattered in hunting groups, headmen would have had more
in[[flu]]ence over their daily activities than did chiefs.

During the period of competition between the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
and the [[North]]west Company, both [[companies]] gave deferential [[treatment]] to
certain individuals to gain their allegiance and the furs hunted by their
groups. These individuals appear to have functioned, or at least were referred
to, as "trading chiefs." They were non-traditional leaders, products of the
relationship between [[Indian]] and [[trade]]r. Their authority was limited and prob
ably only recognized by their own group.
Duncan Cameron, a [[North]]west Company [[trade]]r in the area north of
Lake Nipigon and at Osnaburgh at the end of the 18th century, observed that
trading chiefs were "proud of being reckoned great men, but still they have
little or no in[[flu]]ence over the others, for, after making the father a chief, you
are sometimes obliged to do the same with his son in order to secure his hunt,
for the former has not power enough over him to secure it for you." He noted

further that "the chiefs... are the greatest rogues among them, for if an
[[Indian]] is a good hunter, and has the usual large stock of impudence which
they generally have, with a little cunning, you must make a chief of him to
secure his hunt, otherwise your opponents will debauch him from you, and
you are sure to lose him" ([[Mason]] [[1960]]:278).
After the amalgamation of the [[North]]west Company with the Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company in [[1821]], Hudson's [[Bay]] Company policy was to discontinue
deferential [[treatment]] of headmen. Each hunter was to be dealt with individu

ally according to his efforts and productivity as a trapper. However, the
effects of the old practice persisted for many years. The title of trading chief

was still used by the [[trade]]r and, in some instances, the trading chief still
received deferential [[treatment]], as was the case with Shonshon and Louison at
Pic Post who were still receiving their "chief's clothing" in the [[1930]]s. In the

[[1820]]s and [[1830]]s, two other individuals, LTllinois and Mishemuckqua, were

still referred to as trading chiefs in the Lake Superior District. Along with
Shonshon and Louison, they were represented by the Hudson's [[Bay]] Com
pany [[trade]]rs at Fort William, Nipigon, and Pic Posts as individuals (i.e.,
chiefs) with whom negotiations would have to be conducted for the surrender
of their respective territories. This suggests that, with time, trading chiefs
were elevated to the position of trading post band chiefs.

The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]r George Keith, who was appointed to
a number of different posts in the Lake Superior District during the early to

mid-19th century, claimed in the [[1830]]s that "Chieftainship has in a manner
totally disappeared" and that there were no chiefs "properly speaking"
among the Lake Superior Ojibwa, although there were individuals who
enjoyed some "ascendancy" because of family connections, superior intel
lect, daring and reckless disposition, or because of their expertise and success
as a hunter. Keith noted that such individuals "do however arrogate a superi

ority and during occasional meetings make themselves respected and
obeyed." They were able to "usurp and enforce temporary respect and
authority; but this subjection, to any extent, at least does not hold good much

longer than interest or personal safety prescribe" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
Archives B.129/b/4, B.129/e/6,7,9). These individuals were probably the tra
ditional leaders: hunting group headmen and band chiefs. Keith's observation

that there were no chiefs "properly speaking" suggests that the process
whereby traditional leaders were to be replaced by trading post band chiefs as

persons of authority was in operation in the [[1830]]s, but was not yet fully
developed. Although [[trade]]rs tended to single out prominent persons as chiefs,
trading post bands were not political entities with a single chief with political
authority over all of the hunting groups associated with the post. Only after

trading post bands became [[treaty]] bands were single individuals or chiefs
recognized as having political authority over an entire band. It is likely that
leadership did not become formalized until the later part of the 19th century,
when band elections were institutionalized under the [[Indian]] Act.

On the one hand, an ideal candidate for a trading chief appeared to be
someone who was both a s[[kill]]ed hunter and a spokesperson. Trading chiefs
may have been hunting group headmen in their own right. They would pro
duce successful fur hunts and would be in a position to persuade others to
bring in their furs. Traders rewarded good fur hunters by giving them extras

such as clothing, liquor, and [[tobacco]]. Although hunters were bound by cul
tural conventions to distribute these gifts among their groups, the gifts could
be used to enhance their positions among their followers. A trading chief may

have been appointed by a [[trade]]r because he appeared to be cooperative or
receptive to the presence of the [[trade]]r, or because he could deal with the
[[trade]]r on terms that the [[trade]]r understood. Extras given to trading chiefs
elevated their status regardless of whether or not they were recognized as

leaders. However, it is unlikely that their in[[flu]]ence would have extended
much beyond either their hunting groups or the bands with whom they were
associated. Frequently, a trading post might have more than one trading chief,
a fact that reflects the limited sphere of in[[flu]]ence of these trading chiefs.

Which individuals were identified as chiefs of the Lake Superior
Ojibwa? LTllinois, also known as John Ininway, was a "principal Hunter" at
Fort William during the [[1820]]s and [[1830]]s, and was about 70 years old when
the [[treaty]] was negotiated. Although the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company recognized
LTllinois as the "principal chief" at Fort William, the Jesuit priest described

him as a "Fur Trading Chieftain" who did not have "the main authority" to
act on behalf of the [[Indian]] people, although they "were willing to consider

[him] as Chief" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.231/e/6; Public

Archives of [[Canada]], RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]56-59; Fremiot [[1973]]:593-594).
LTllinois status as an elder no doubt afforded him considerable respect. After

his [[death]] in [[1868]], he was succeeded as the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company chief by
his son Maugadina. Apparently, LTllinois had his own group of followers, as
did Peau de Chat, the other chief at Fort William (Public Archives of [[Canada]]

RG10, Volume 2115, f.2[[1900]]). The split between these two groups appears
to have been based on the distinction between "inside" and "outside" lead
ers, and on religious differences between Catholics and Methodists.

Joseph Peau de Chat was about 40 years old when the [[treaty]] was nego
tiated, and he died the following year. He was described as being "big and
handsome, with a vibrant and sonorous voice." According to the Jesuit mis
sionary, Peau de Chat was chosen by the [[Indian]] people as chief because of
"his eloquent spirit [and] his vehement impetuosity" (Fremiot [[1973]]:593
594). According to John Baptiste Penassie, the first band chief of Fort Wil
liam elected under the [[Indian]] Act in [[1880]], Peau de Chat "was the only chief

appointed by the [[government]] for some time before that [i.e., before
Penassie's election]" (Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 2115,
f.2[[1900]]).
When Peau de Chat attempted to declare himself spokesman for all Lake

Superior Ojibwa, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs at Fort William and at
Nipigon claimed that the [[Indian]] people frequenting the posts in the Lake
Superior District did not recognize his authority to act on their behalf. In
[[1848]], Peau de Chat told the Nipigon [[Indian]]s that the [[government]] had made
him chief over the entire Lake Superior area from the Pigeon River to
Michipicoten. Nevertheless, the Nipigon [[Indian]]s did not acknowledge this
claim because, according to James Anderson, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
[[trade]]r at Lake Nipigon, Peau de Chat "was too well known to the [[Indian]]s to
be believed." Although Peau de Chat prided himself on his abilities as a pub
lic speaker and wanted to be "the [[Great]] Man," the [[trade]]rs warned the
[[government]]'s [[representative]]s against accepting his pretensions, describing

him as a cunning rogue with a dreadful tongue who was also under the
in[[flu]]ence of the Jesuit missionary (Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume

266:[[1631]]56-59). The [[trade]]rs' animosity towards Peau de Chat and their
denial of his claims to be a spokesman for all Lake Superior Ojibwa may
have been prompted by his association with the Jesuit missionary. After his

[[death]] in [[1851]], Peau de Chat was succeeded by Jacob Wassaba or Waiassabe,
who was appointed by the Fort William [[Indian]]s (Public Archives of [[Canada]]
RG10, Volume2115, f.2[[1900]]).
At the Nipigon post, the [[trade]]r recognized Mishemuckqua as chief as
early as the mid-[[1830]]s, and he was still identified as such when the [[treaty]] was
negotiated. His totem was reported to be the eagle, and his mother was said to

be a "halfbreed" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.149/a/19; Public
Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]56-59). Another Nipigon [[Indian]]
named Manitoushainse, whose totem was the kingfisher (Public Archives of
[[Canada]] RG10, Volume 9501), signed the [[treaty]] as a principal man. He was a
relative of Peau de Chat, and, according to the Nipigon [[trade]]r, Peau de Chat

wanted to oust Mishemuckqua and replace him with Manitoushainse (Public
Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]56-59). This suggests that, as at
Fort William, there may have been rivalry between the two kinds of leaders.
Little is known about the Pic chiefs, Shonshon and Louison. Even less is

known about the Long Lake chief, Tabasash, other than that he had three
wives and four adult sons in [[1850]], and may have hunted south of the height
of land which represents the natural boundary between the Lake Superior and

[[Arctic]] watersheds. He died in [[1853]] or [[1854]] (Public Archives of [[Canada]]
RG10, Volume 9497; Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.129/d/7). As early
as the late [[1820]]s, Louison was "considered the Chief" by the [[trade]]r at the
Pic Post, and was given "chief's clothing" in recognition of his position
(Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.162/a/l). Shonshon was also referred to
as a chief in the post journals, was given "a set of chief's clothing" by the
[[trade]]r, and was identified as a chief on the [[treaty]] annuity pay lists (Hudson's

[[Bay]] Company Archives B.162/a/8,ll; Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10,
Volume 9497). Both Louison and Shonshon were considered to be good
hunters because they usually paid their winter debts each spring, and may
also have been hunting group headmen (or possibly band chiefs) in their own

right. It was Hudson's [[Bay]] Company policy to give clothing to hunters who
paid their winter debts in the spring (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives
B.129/a/20), and Shonshon and Louison's positions were further enhanced by

these gifts of "chief's clothing." Both Louison and Shonshon died in [[1858]]

or [[1859]].

The Michipicoten chiefs, Michel Totominai and Chiginans, were
brothers, Totominai being the elder. Their totem was the pike (Archives of
[[Ontario]] MU1125). They, along with Peau de Chat, LTllinois, Mishemuckqua

and the Pic and Long Lake chiefs, were identified as the individuals who
would have to be consulted concerning the surrender of their lands.

Events Leading up to the [[Treaty]]
During the [[1840]]s, a [[mining]] boom in northern Michigan generated a corre
sponding interest in copper deposits on the north shores of Lakes Superior
and [[Huron]], particularly in the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, and on the north

shore of Lake [[Huron]] and the northeast shore of Lake Superior. The Ojibwa
had not ceded their hunting grounds to the [[Crown]] and objected to the explo

ration and [[mining]] activities. In [[1847]], the Ojibwa claiming the territory in
which the most intensive [[mining]] activity was occurring petitioned Lord
Elgin, [[Governor]] General of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], to appoint someone to
meet them in council and negotiate a [[treaty]]. Shinguakonce from Garden
River and Nebenagoching from Sault Ste. Marie were among the principal
activists in this initial effort to negotiate a [[treaty]] (Public Archives of [[Canada]]

RG10, Volume 123:6190-98).
The following year ([[1848]]), a larger than usual number of Ojibwa from
the shores of Lake Superior and Lake [[Huron]] gathered in [[August]] at Mani
towaning on Manitoulin Island in Lake [[Huron]] for the annual present distribu

tion by the [[Indian]] Department in anticipation of negotiating a [[treaty]] as a
result of the [[1847]] petition. Among them were "nearly all" of the Ojibwa
who regularly [[trade]]d at Fort William, including the "young chief" Peau de
Chat and the "old chief" LTllinois. They had been urged to go to Mani
towaning by Peau de Chat who told them that they would receive a large sum

of money for their lands as well as the usual presents (Public Archives of

[[Canada]] RG10, Volume 572; Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives D.5/22,
fo.314-15).
While they were at Manitowaning, the Ojibwa from Lake Superior and
Lake [[Huron]] met in council with Thomas G. Anderson, an [[Indian]] Superinten
dent from the Province of [[Canada]] West, who had been appointed by the
[[Governor]] General "to investigate the claims of the [[Indian]] people and to con
sider the best method of compensating the [[Indian]]s for any loss it [Anderson's

investigation] may prove they have experienced." Shinguakonce, speaking
on behalf of the Garden River [[Indian]]s, told Anderson that the activities of the
miners were destroying their hunting grounds, while Peau de Chat said that
he was concerned about the conflicts that the different demands of the fur

[[trade]]r and the missionary were creating for the Ojibwa. Peau de Chat indi
cated that he was willing to sell his land and its minerals in order to enable
the miners and [[trade]]rs to do as they pleased and so that the Ojibwa could live
as they pleased on land that was reserved for them. Anderson subsequently
recommended that the Government should extinguish the Ojibwa's claims by
negotiating a [[treaty]] that would provide them with a perpetual annuity and

reserves "for them to cultivate hereafter" (Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10,

Volume 534:255-58).

However, the Government did not act on Anderson's recommendation

until after a delegation of Ojibwa from the Sault Ste. Marie area, including

Shinguakonce and Nebenagoching, went to Montreal in [[June]] [[1849]] and
threatened to take the necessary steps to remove the miners from their lands
if their claim was not settled (Illustrated London [[New]]s [[1849]]). Once again, in

anticipation of negotiating a [[treaty]] but unaware of the delay, a group of
Ojibwa from Fort William, as well as Nipigon and Pic Posts, had left for
Sault Ste. Marie in [[June]], where they apparently expected to meet a represen
tative of the Government and to ac[[company]] him to Michipicoten to attend a
council. However, rumors of a cholera [[epidemic]] frightened them into return

ing to their territories early in [[August]] [[1849]] before the delegation had
returned from Montreal to await the arrival of "the gentlemen appointed to

treat with the [[Indian]]s for their Mineral Lands" (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
Archives D.5/25, fo.543-44; D.5/26, fo.76-77).
At about the same time that the Lake Superior Ojibwa were leaving
Sault Ste. Marie, the Government appointed [[Indian]] Superintendent Anderson

and Alexander Vidal, Deputy Provincial Surveyor, to meet with the Ojibwa
and ascertain the basis for their claims to, and their expectations concerning
the surrender of, their lands. Anderson and Vidal accordingly attempted to

meet with as many Ojibwa as possible during [[September]] and early [[October]]
by "calling at all the places to which the [[Indian]]s usually resort," but the
majority had already left the shores of Lakes Superior and [[Huron]] for their
winter hunting grounds. Consequently, the commissioners were able to hold
councils with the Lake Superior Ojibwa only at Fort William and Michipi
coten, although they had also intended to hold councils with the Ojibwa at
Nipigon and Pic posts. During their journey from Fort William to Michipi
coten, they spoke briefly with a few Nipigon [[Indian]]s who were fishing off the

islands in Nipigon [[Bay]] and a group of unidentified [[Indian]]s, accompanied by
men from Pic Post, who were fishing at Pays Plat. As a result, they relied on
the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]r at Pic Post for information concerning the
[[Indian]]s who frequented that area. There were no [[Indian]] people at the post at
that time to verify or expand on what he said. In addition, while at Pic Post,

Anderson wrote to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]r at Nipigon Post and
asked him to provide information concerning the Lake Nipigon [[Indian]]s
because the commissioners had been unable to contact them. The [[trade]]r's
reply came too late to be included in their final report (Public Archives of

[[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]16-55).
At Fort William, Vidal and Anderson held a two-day council with a
group of about twenty-five "Chiefs and [[Indian]]s," including Peau de Chat
and LTllinois. The resident Jesuit priest, Father N. Fremiot, was also in

attendance. On the first day, Peau de Chat told the commissioners that he and
the other (unidentified) chiefs intended to go to Montreal to see the [[Governor]]
General because Vidal and Anderson did not have the authority to negotiate a
[[treaty]]. However, by the end of the second day, Peau de Chat seemed disposed
to surrender his land and demanded $30 each year in payment for every man,

woman and [[child]] (ibid., Fremiot [[1973]]:593-598).
When Vidal and Anderson asked the assembly to name the leader of the
assembled chiefs, they indicated Peau de Chat. Even though Anderson had
met with Peau de Chat the previous summer, Anderson replied that the
[[Governor]] General had neither been aware of, nor had approved, their choice

of Peau de Chat as leader. Nonetheless, both Peau de Chat and LTllinois,
who was recognized by the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company as chief, were allowed to
speak on behalf of the Fort William [[Indian]]s (Public Archives of [[Canada]]

RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]16-55).
During their council at Michipicoten, those who were in attendance ?
the chief, presumably Totominai, and three others ? told Vidal and Anderson
that they would agree to any arrangement that was made between the com

missioners and Shinguakonse, chief of the Garden River Band. They
demanded $100.00 a year for every man, woman and [[child]] in payment for
their land. Anderson told them that he expected to return the following
spring with a [[treaty]] and asked them to have "8 or 10 [[Indian]]s" from the sev

eral posts on Lake Superior at Michipicoten to sign the [[treaty]] (ibid.,
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives D.5/26, fo.271, fo.289). The commis
sioners then proceeded on their journey to Sault Ste. Marie and Lake [[Huron]].

Vidal and Anderson prepared a report for the [[government]] (Public
Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]16-55) in which they identified
the bands, their chiefs, their territories and the "Reservations which the
[[Indian]]s wish[ed] to make." According to this report, there were five bands
on the north shore of Lake Superior. These were identified as the Fort Wil
liam, Nipigon, Pic, Long Lake, and Michipicoten Bands. The Long Lake
[[Indian]]s who hunted south of the height of land were associated through

extensive marriage ties with the Pic [[Indian]]s (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
Archives B.162/e/l). Because of their size and the extent of the territory
reportedly claimed by each, these bands were no [[aboriginal]] bands, but rather

trading post bands whose membership consisted of the remains of several
[[aboriginal]] bands and associated hunting groups that occupied territories in
the vicinity of each of the five Lake Superior trading posts.

The populations of each of these trading post bands remained relatively
stable during the early to mid-19th century. The total population for the Lake

Superior District in [[1828]]-[[1830]] was estimated by Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
[[trade]]rs to be 700-800 people, divided into 154 families. According to the
information given to Vidal and Anderson in [[1849]], the Lake Superior District

population had increased to between 900 and 1,000 people (Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company Archives B.129/e/5-6; Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume
266:[[1631]]16-55). The number of people associated with each post suggests
that from three to six [[aboriginal]] bands frequented each area (Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company Archives B.129/e/l,5-6; B.231/e/l,6-7; B.149/e/l-2,4; B.162/e/l;
B117/e/5; Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 9497:26-38).
During the 30 years prior to [[1850]], the Fort William trading post band
numbered about 200 people. From [[1820]] to [[1849]], approximately 200 to 300
people were associated with the Nipigon Post. At Michipicoten, the trading
post band numbered about 100 to 150 people prior to [[1850]]. The Pic and Long

Lake [[Indian]]s, who hunted south of the height of land, were usually
enumerated as a group and averaged about 200 to 250 people during the
thirty years prior to [[1850]]. The Pic trading post band was twice the size of the
group from Long Lake which hunted south of the height of land.
In their report, Vidal and Anderson described the reserves that were to

be set apart for the Fort William and Michipicoten Bands, but did not identify
reserves for the other three bands of Lake Superior Ojibwa. This reflects the

fact that they were able to hold councils with only the Fort William and
Michipicoten [[Indian]]s. They noted that Peau de Chat wanted the Nipigon and
Pic [[Indian]]s to reside on the Fort William Reserve, but added that those bands
would probably prefer reserves "at their respective haunts."
Peau de Chat and LTllinois were identified as the chiefs of the Fort Wil
liam [[Indian]]s, Mishemuckqua was named as the chief of the Nipigon [[Indian]]s,

Totominai and his brother Chiginans were identified as the chiefs of the
Michipicoten [[Indian]]s, and Shonshon and Louison were said to be the chiefs
of the Pic [[Indian]]s. The Long Lake chief was unknown to Vidal and Anderson

at the time that they prepared their report, but a [[June]] [[1850]] census of the
[[Indian]] population at Long Lake indicated that the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
considered Tabasash (Tabaishash) to be the chief, and that 80 of the 216 Long

Lake [[Indian]]s, possibly including Tabasash, hunted south of the height of
land, and thus had an interest in the area that was to be surrendered by the

[[treaty]] (Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, V9497).
For the most part, these chiefs were identified on the basis of informa
tion provided by the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs and, according to Vidal
and Anderson, they were "vested ... with a species of authority and control

over its [a trading post band's] individual members and its [[property]]." How
ever, they also noted that the authority and control of the chiefs was "neither

well-defined nor regulated" but was "generally submitted to when circum
stances require its exercise." The chiefs would have to be consulted with,
either collectively or individually, for the surrender of their lands, and Vidal

and Anderson cautioned against accepting the claims of any individual to be
the spokesman for all the [[Indian]] people. They noted that occasionally an indi

Hansen / Chiefs and Principal Men 53
vidual chief would, because of his "superior information, intelligence or cun

ning," either assume or obtain the authority to act on behalf of the other
[[Indian]] people. In Vidal's and Anderson's opinion, Peau de Chat was one
such chief, but his "selfishness" and "utter disregard to the interests of the

others" made it evident to them as well as to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
[[trade]]rs that the terms he was attempting to negotiate "would not have
satisfied those whose sentiments [he] professed to express" (Public Archives
of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]16-55).
Although his information was too late to be included in their report, the

Nipigon Post [[trade]]r had cautioned Vidal and Anderson against accepting
Peau de Chat's claim to be the spokesman for all the Lake Superior Ojibwa
(Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]56-59). The following
year, the Fort William [[trade]]r cautioned Robinson, the [[government]]'s [[treaty]]
negotiator, to take note of what the chief of each post had to say concerning
the surrender of their respective territories (Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10,

Volume 266:[[1631]]67-71).
Negotiating the [[Treaty]]
The Sault Ste. Marie Ojibwa had threatened to take steps to remove the min
ers from their lands if their claim was not settled. They had fully expected
Vidal and Anderson to negotiate a [[treaty]] with them. When this did not tran
spire, they formed a party of approximately 100, including "Half breeds,"
[[Indian]]s and three non-[[Indian]]s, and seized the [[Quebec]] Mining Company's
operations at Mica [[Bay]] on Lake Superior in [[November]], [[1849]]. The [[Indian]]
leaders were arrested and taken to [[Toronto]] (Public Archives of [[Canada]]
RG10, Volume 612:393-421, 700-02).
William Benjamin Robinson ([[1797]]-[[1873]]), Minister of Provincial Parlia
ment for Simcoe and Commissioner of Public Works, interceded on behalf of
the arrested [[Indian]]s and secured their release. He told the Superintendent of
[[Indian]] Affairs that the Sault Ste. Marie Ojibwa, at least, were anxious to have

their claim dealt with and was subsequently appointed to negotiate a [[treaty]]
with the Ojibwa of Lake Superior and Lake [[Huron]] (Public Archives of Can
ada RG10, Volume 180, fo.4113, Volume 513:219-20).
Robinson accordingly made a trip to Sault Ste. Marie in the spring of
[[1850]] to inform the Ojibwa about his appointment and to make arrangements
with them for a meeting to negotiate a [[treaty]]. He met with the six leaders or
chiefs from the north shore of Lake [[Huron]] and they agreed to meet again in

[[August]] at Garden River (Archives of [[Ontario]], Robinson Papers; Morris
[[1979]]:17-21). Robinson wrote to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs at Fort
William and Michipicoten asking them to convey the arrangements for the
meeting to the Lake Superior Ojibwa. When he learned of the arrangements,

Peau de Chat was displeased that the Sault Ste. Marie chiefs had not con

suited with the others. However, he and the other "in[[flu]]ential [[Indian]]s" at
Fort William agreed to go after Chief Factor MacKenzie told them that it
would be foolish to refuse since they had been lobbying for a settlement of
their claim for a number of years. Some of the Michipicoten [[Indian]]s had indi
cated to George Simpson, [[Governor]] of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, that they,
too, were disinclined to go. However, they consented after the Hudson's [[Bay]]

Company [[trade]]r, John Swanston, agreed to ac[[company]] them (Public
Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 266:[[1631]]67-71; Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
Archives B.231/a/20, D.5/28 fo.465-66, fo.597-98).
Robinson returned to Sault Ste. Marie in [[August]] [[1850]]. Shortly thereaf
ter, a delegation of about 15 of the "principal [[Indian]]s" from Fort William
arrived together with an unspecified number of "deputies" from Nipigon, six

to eight "hunters" from Michipicoten, and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
[[trade]]r, John Swanston. The available documentation does not indicate
whether any [[representative]]s of the Pic or Long Lake [[Indian]]s accompanied
this delegation. After learning that Peau de Chat was ill and unable to travel
the extra distance, Robinson changed the location of the meeting from Gar

den River to Sault Ste. Marie (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives B.231/a/20,
D.5/28 fo.465-66, fo.597-98; Archives of [[Ontario]], Robinson Papers).
Formal negotiations for the surrender of the Ojibwa's territory began on

[[September]] 5, [[1850]]. On [[September]] 6,[[1850]], the Lake Superior delegation held
a council among themselves to discuss the terms offered by Robinson and
told him that they had agreed to sign a [[treaty]] ceding their territory. On Sep

tember 7, [[1850]], the Robinson Superior [[Treaty]] was signed by four "Chiefs"
and five "principal men." To ensure that there was no misunderstanding, two

interpreters "carefully read over and translated" the [[treaty]] for the Lake
Superior Ojibwa.
Robinson kept a detailed diary of the negotiations (Archives of [[Ontario]],

Robinson Papers). He referred to "Peau de Chat and his chiefs and principal
men" throughout his diary, indicating that he regarded Peau de Chat as the
spokesman for the Lake Superior Ojibwa, despite the efforts of Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs to discredit Peau de Chat. The only other Lake Supe
rior Ojibwa identified by name in Robinson's diary is Totominai, the Michip
icoten chief. Yet, the [[treaty]] was signed by two other chiefs named LTllinois
from Fort William and Mishemuckqua from Nipigon, and by five "principal

men": Shebageshick, Wassaba (who succeeded Peau de Chat as chief in
[[1851]]), Ahmutchiwagabow from Fort William, Manitoushainse from Nipi
gon, and Chiginans from Michipicoten. Note that in [[1849]], Chiginans had
been identified as a chief by Vidal and Anderson. Louison, Shonshon, and
Tabasash, who had been identified the year before the [[treaty]] was negotiated
as the chiefs of the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s, did not sign, i.e., did not put

Hansen / Chiefs and Principal Men 55
their marks on the [[treaty]]. There is also no evidence to indicate whether they
were present at the negotiations.

The Lake Superior Ojibwa were promised an initial cash payment, a
perpetual annuity, hunting and fishing rights, and reserves (Public Archives

of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume [[1844]]). The initial cash payment was entrusted to
the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs at Michipicoten and Fort William for dis
tribution by Robinson and the Lake Superior delegation. Those considered to
be entitled to a share of the initial cash payment received their money from

the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs. However, because they had already
obtained their winter supplies and gone inland, the Pic and Long Lake
[[Indian]]s and many of the Nipigon and Fort William [[Indian]]s did not receive
their [[treaty]] money until the following spring of [[1851]] (Archives of [[Ontario]],

Robinson Papers; Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Archives D.5/29 fo.5-6, fo.353
54, fo.412a-12b; B.134/c/67 fo.133; B.5/28 fo.645; D.4/43 fo.l07d-108d;

D.4/73; D.4/45).
The [[treaty]] also stipulated that the annuity would be distributed each
summer at the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company posts at Fort William and Michipi
coten. The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company undertook this responsibility until [[1875]]
or [[1876]], when an [[Indian]] agent was stationed at Port Arthur (now part of
Thunder [[Bay]], [[Ontario]]), and took over the responsibility for the distribution.

The annuity pay lists included the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s, as well as the
Fort William, Nipigon, and Michipicoten [[Indian]]s (Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
Archives B.129/d/7; Public Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 9497, Vol

ume 9501). Because the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s received [[treaty]] money
and annuities equal to those distributed by Hudson's [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs to
the Fort William, Nipigon, and Michipicoten Bands, it is clear that they were
considered to be entitled to receive the financial benefits of the [[treaty]].
Three reserves were identified and set apart from the area ceded by the

Lake Superior Ojibwa. Two of these were first described in the Vidal
Anderson report: (a) near the mouth of the Kaministiquia River (Fort Wil

liam Reserve Number 52) for "Peau de Chat and his tribe"; and (b) on
Michipicoten [[Bay]] west of the Magpie River (Gros Cap Reserve 349) for
"Totominai and Tribe." The third, for "Chief Mishemuckqua and Tribe,"
was identified during the [[treaty]] negotiations and was located at the mouth of
the Gull River on Lake Nipigon (Gull River Reserve Number 55).
Thirty years after the [[treaty]] was negotiated, the Pic Band petitioned the
[[government]] of [[Canada]] to give them a reserve on the banks of the Pic River.
According to this petition, their "numbers were considered" when the [[treaty]]

was negotiated, but "no reserve was secured to [them] by said [[Treaty]] owing
to the conduct of [their] Chief who instead of going to Sault Ste. Marie, with
drew to the interior of the land being afraid of falling into a snare" (Public

Archives of [[Canada]] RG10, Volume 2137, f.27806). Subsequently, several

other groups of Ojibwa were identified by the Department of [[Indian]] Affairs

as being "reserveless," and reserves were surveyed for them during the
[[1880]]s at Long Lake, Mclntyre [[Bay]] on Lake Nipigon, the mouth of the Nipi
gon River on Lake Helen, and at Pays Plat and the mouth of the Pic River on

Lake Superior ([[Ontario]] Ministry of Natural Resources [[Indian]] Lands Files
#[[1755]]55, 327072, #[[1859]]45, #[[1859]]46, #[[1758]]98).

Conclusions
The sociopolitical organization of the Lake Superior Ojibwa during the mid
19th century operated on three levels of inclusivity, the hunting group, the
band, and the trading post band, and was characterized by the contradiction

between "inside" and "outside" leaders. Leadership at the trading post
band level was non-traditional and more formalized than at the hunting group
and band levels, largely as a result of interaction with [[trade]]rs and their partic

ular form of socioeconomic organization. Formalization of leadership roles
continued with increasing involvement of [[government]] in the affairs of [[Indian]]
bands, culminating in the present system of band elections for chief and band

councillors.

At the hunting group and band levels, the consensus of the group and the
s[[kill]]s and knowledge possessed by an individual and required in a particular
situation were paramount for the recognition of that individual's authority to
act as a leader. Since a hunting group operated on its own for most of the
year, its headman had a greater degree of authority in the day-to-day activi
ties of the group than did the band chief, whose leadership was limited to
those occasions when the band assembled, or the trading post band chief.

At the trading post band level of sociopolitical organization, the
individual(s) identified as chief had usually acquired the status of trading
chief in the early 19th century. While he may have been a hunting group
headman in his own right, his position as trading chief was created and
enhanced by the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, and was elevated to that of trading
post band chief when it became necessary to identify a [[representative]] of the
[[Indian]]s associated with each post to negotiate the [[treaty]]. A trading post band

chief's authority, as an "outside" leader, was limited to the activities at the
trading post and other interactions with [[Europe]]ans. Whether his authority
was recognized by the [[Indian]]s in other circumstances is open to debate.

Those who were identified in [[1849]] by Vidal and Anderson as the chiefs
of the Lake Superior Ojibwa were so named with the assistance of the

Hudson's [[Bay]] Company. Peau de Chat, LTllinois, Mishemuckqua,
Shonshon, Louison, Tabasash, Totominai and Chiginans, his brother, were
said to be the persons with whom negotiations would have to be conducted,

either individually or collectively, for the cession of the Lake Superior
Ojibwa's territory. These individuals, with the exception of Peau de Chat,

had been referred to as trading chiefs prior to the [[treaty]] and were represented
to Vidal and Anderson as the chiefs of the trading post bands. However, the
limited authority of a trading post band chief was recognized by the [[trade]]rs as
they emphasized the need to negotiate with the chiefs of all the Lake Superior

posts. Vidal's and Anderson's comments on trading post band chiefs in gen
eral suggest that they also recognized that the authority of these individuals
was circumscribed and did not extend to other trading post bands.

The available evidence suggests that the recognition afforded trading
post band chiefs by the Hudson's. [[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs, as well as the
[[Indian]]s' apparent acceptance of their ability as "outside" leaders to interact
with non-natives, ensured their position at the [[treaty]] negotiations. Conse
quently, although the Lake Superior delegation consisted of 25 to 30 individ
uals, trading post band chiefs were prevalent among the chiefs and principal

men who negotiated the [[treaty]]. However, they were not the only type of
leader present. Peau de Chat, who acted as spokesman for the delegation, was
present and signed the [[treaty]], as did at least one other, more traditional, type

of leader (Manitoushainse). It is possible that the delegation included other
"inside" leaders who did not participate directly in the negotiations or put
their marks on the [[treaty]] document but were, nonetheless, consulted with by

the more vocal "outside" leaders. The contradiction between "inside" and
"outside" leaders would have been partially resolved by the presence of both
at the [[treaty]] negotiations.
While there is no direct evidence to indicate that the chiefs and principal
men, with the exception of Peau de Chat, were appointed by any of the trad
ing post bands or that any councils were held among the [[Indian]]s prior to the
departure of the delegation to Sault Ste. Marie, it is unlikely, given the nature

of Ojibwa sociopolitical organization, that an event of such obvious import
could have taken place without considerable discussion and consultation.
Furthermore, the authority of the delegation to negotiate the [[treaty]] does not

appear to have been questioned by either the [[Indian]]s or the [[government]]'s
[[representative]].

Robinson conducted the negotiations in counsel with the Lake Superior
delegation, who agreed after consulting among themselves, to the terms that
were offered. For the most part, these terms were based on the recommenda
tions that were outlined in the Vidal-Anderson report and were the result of

the discussions held by Vidal and Anderson with the [[Indian]]s in [[1849]]. It is
clear that many of the chiefs and principal men who negotiated the two
Robinson Treaties did so after several years of lobbying [[government]] to settle

their claims. They did not enter into those negotiations with only a naive
understanding of the immediate implications of the outcome.

An issue related to this discussion of leadership, although there is
insufficient evidence to resolve it conclusively, is the apparent absence of the

Pic and Long Lake chiefs at the [[treaty]] negotiations. The available evidence
indicates that the Pic [[Indian]]s and, because of their association with them, the
Long Lake [[Indian]]s were aware that a [[treaty]] was to be negotiated for the sur
render of their lands. The individuals with whom it was believed negotiations

would have to be conducted were identified and the approximate extent of
their territories was known at least one year prior to the negotiations, and yet

the Pic and Long Lake chiefs did not sign the [[treaty]], nor do they appear to

have been present at the negotiations. They may have been represented by
one of the chiefs and principal men or another member of the delegation.
However, given the nature of [[Indian]] leadership and the fact that reserves
were not set apart for them at that time, it is unlikely that any such extension

of authority would have gone unmentioned, since the chiefs and principal
men who were present would not have had unilateral authority to cede
another band's ([[aboriginal]] or trading post) territory.

Although the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s do not appear to have partici
pated directly in the [[treaty]] negotiations at Sault Ste. Marie, provisions were
made for their indirect participation. They received their share of the [[treaty]]
money as well as the annuity that was promised by [[government]]. The entitle
ment of the Pic and Long Lake [[Indian]]s to the financial benefits of the [[treaty]]

does not appear to have been questioned by the [[Indian]]s, or by the Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company [[trade]]rs who distributed the annuity and the [[government]] that
provided the funds.

One speculative explanation for their apparent absence is a corollary of
the circumstances that prompted the [[treaty]], namely, the conflicts between the

[[Indian]] people and miners. Since the area occupied by the Pic and Long Lake
[[Indian]]s was not subject to extensive mineral exploration or [[mining]] activities
at the time, both the [[Indian]]s and the [[treaty]] negotiator may have felt it unnec
essary to make provisions for reserves or for their direct participation in the
negotiations, and that it was sufficient that provisions were made for their
indirect participation.
Another possible explanation may be tied in with the petition presented
to [[government]] in [[1880]] by the Pic [[Indian]]s when they requested a reserve. The
petitioners claimed that they had intended to participate in the [[treaty]] but were

not represented at the negotiations because their chief, fearing "a snare,"
withdrew to the interior. Any number of scenarios are suggested by the use of
the term "snare," including witchcraft, im[[prison]]ment for a crime, even coer
cion to agree to the terms of the [[treaty]], but the fact that they were petitioning

for a reserve that was not originally provided for in the [[treaty]] suggests that
the petitioners considered themselves to be entitled to one under the [[treaty]].

It is hoped that further [[research]] on the issue of leadership and other, as
yet undiscovered, historical documents will increase our understanding of the
events surrounding this [[treaty]] and the dynamics of leadership in the context

of those negotiations. One area that needs to be investigated is the oral tradi
tion of the bands in the [[treaty]] area. Another is genealogical [[research]] to reveal
the relationships among the bands and to identify the hunting groups that

were associated with each post and subsequently comprised the trading post

band.
