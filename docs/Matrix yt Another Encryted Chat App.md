The recent in[[flu]]x of millions of Signal users, and its subsequent temporary 
outage, caused many users to briefly move their communications to other 
platforms. Many alternatives were adopted to take on the task such as Telegram 
and good old fashioned e-mail and SMS. This event has highlighted the necessity 
to develop alternates and contingencies in case primary communications are 
knocked out. ([[Research]] “PACE plan”)
 
Matrix is another such network which addresses two of Signal’s most commonly 
cited shortcomings: Centralization, and the use of phone numbers for user ID.
 
Matrix is what the network is called, but there are several clients available to
use it. Probably the best one out there is called Element (formerly Riot.im).
 
Matrix is also decentralized. When signing up, most people tend to create an 
account at Matrix.org[1], although there are many other Matrix servers that all 
federate with each other, as well as some that are isolated. It is no small 
task, but a resourceful and willing organization could even run the Matrix 
software on its own server for only its members to use.
 
Rather than requiring a phone number to create an account, Matrix only needs a 
username. Email addresses and phone numbers are optional. Users are searchable. 
Handles are in the format @username:homeserver.com
 
Until the recent addition of Admin roles and the ability to remove members from 
groups, this was another advantage that Matrix had over Signal.
 
Matrix lets you create Public or Private rooms, as well as direct messages.
 
It’s important to note that Matrix does not encrypt new rooms by default. You 
have to toggle the “Enable encryption” switch when you create a room.
