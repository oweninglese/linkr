Originally published in Lêgerîn Issue No 1. The Lêgerîn mission statement is 
“Difusión de la ideología de la revolución en Rojava, y de las ideas de Rêber 
Apo, el Confederalismo Democrático.” The original article and magazine can be 
viewed here.[1] They are also available in [[Spanish]], Portuguese, and [[French]].
 
The context in Latin [[America]] and [[Africa]] is very similar, in many respects, to 
that of the Middle East. These similarities exist because of the inhuman 
exploitation of the [[Europe]]an nation-states in their period of colonialist and 
imperialist expansion. Since the beginning of the “discovery” of the [[Africa]]n and
[[America]]n continents, the original peoples have been suffering from the external 
intervention of capitalist states and their economic interests, motivated by 
monopoly aspirations. Because of the process of extermination and assimilation 
carried out in both continents, the consequences of this horrible period can be 
seen up to today.
 
Not surprisingly, from the beginning of the occupation of the territory, the 
natives offered great resistance to the “civilized” [[mental]]ity and to their 
capitalist understanding of “progress”. This was one of the reasons why the 
colonizers committed several genocides (physical and cultural). The cultures 
found in the territory were diverse, from the state structures of the [[Aztec]] 
Empire in what is now [[Mexico]] to the [[King]]dom of Benin in what is now Nigeria. 
Dozens of already organized states were subjected to colonial domination through
force, extermination and genocide. Among them, the Luba Empire, the Lunda 
Empire, the [[King]]dom of Cazembe, the [[King]]dom of Congo, the [[Inca]] and the [[May]]an
Civilization. In addition to the great [[empire]]s that existed (some with more than
4 thousand years of existence), thousands of tribes lived in these territories 
and organized themselves in different ways.
 
However, it is common to find tribes that lived in common, as is the case in 
Brazil. With about 300 different ethnic groups and 270 different languages, most
of the tribes survived from subsistence agriculture, there was no centralized 
form of power, the economy was based on exchange and equitable division of 
surplus, religion was not dogmatic or monotheistic, the education of [[child]]ren 
was the responsibility of the community, no time was not linear and animism was 
common to all tribes. In the [[Africa]]n continent, tribal organization was the 
common way of managing the
existing societies and many were subject to the great [[empire]]s of the region, 
(already mentioned
above) very similar to the process of domination of the [[empire]]s that existed in 
the Middle East region throughout [[history]] (Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, 
Persian, Ottoman, etc.). However, [[multiculturalism]] and the diversity of these 
tribes and ethnicities have remained present within these societies and many 
still survive the process of assimilation today. It is not difficult to find 
similarities between these forms of organization and the societies that 
inhabited Mesopotamia in the Neolithic period, the difference is that instead of
a city-state being the colonizer, in the case of [[Africa]] and Latin [[America]], the 
nation-states were the colonizers with their capitalist and ultra-nationalist 
[[mental]]ity.
 
The Similarities Between These
Regions and Kurdistan
 
Although they succeeded in gaining their independence from the colonizing 
states, some before others, they now face countless problems on both continents.
Among them, extreme [[poverty]], social inequality, economic dependence, [[violence]], 
neo-[[colonialism]], etc. Although these processes occurred in different forms and 
ways, we can find some similarities between them and try to understand why these
societies are in the current situation. One of the points we can analyses is the
formation of the nation states as their solution for national [[liberation]], here, 
we can observe a parallelism between the Kurdish question and Rêber Apo’s 
understanding of the nation state. In the early days of the party and the 
Kurdish [[liberation]] movement, the idea of creating a Kurdish state to defend the 
interests of the Kurdish people was seen as a possibility of obtaining decent 
living conditions. Since the Kurdish people have been denied their own rights of
existence. Their language, culture, tradition, social organization, were 
forbidden. They were criminalized for being who they are, in their own territory
– divided between [[Turkey]], Syria, Iraq and [[Iran]]. This reminds us of a Zapatista 
saying: “To be seen, we cover our faces; to be named, we deny them our names; we
bet on the present, so that we have a future? and to live, we die. Once again, 
the similarities of the inhumane systematic form of capitalism became evident. 
In Kurdistan or Chiapas, this system en[[slaves]] and [[kill]]s everything and everyone 
who dares to think differently.
 
However, over time and a process of deep analysis, by critics and self-critics, 
the idea of the nation-state was
reconsidered. The state is incapable of offering life in a free society, once 
its formation is directly related to a process
of assimilation, authoritarianism, subjugation of diversity, nationalism and 
especially patriarchy. As such, it is the main perpetrator of the [[mental]]ity that
en[[slaves]] and exploits people. Even some independence movements that had a 
progressive ideal, such as Haiti in [[1804]] (it was the first Latin [[America]]n 
country to declare independence and the first to end [[slavery]]), could not escape 
imperialist exploitation and submitted to the external interests of other states
so that it could be recognized by other states and exist as a nation-state.
 
Beyond the Nation-State
 
It is not possible to be free while being organized as a nation state, it is 
necessary to build an alternative to the state and its [[mental]]ity. This 
alternative is the reorganization of society around the political and moral 
society (ahlaq), this can be observed initially in the primitive socialism in 
the societies of the neolithic period. From this analysis, democratic 
confederalism emerges, the Rebêr Apo paradigm expressed and implemented by the 
Kurdistan [[liberation]] movement in all its dimensions, from the Bakur Mountains to
the Rojava [[revolution]]. This is why these democratic ideas of the party can 
contribute to the advancement of society in Latin [[America]] and [[Africa]] and develop
a truly free space. Even more so because these are societies rich in 
multicultural diversity, with communal origins and a strong heritage of 
resistance, as well as Kurdish society. Since the reorganization of the party 
around the new paradigm, it is not difficult to observe and see these 
similarities between Kurds, Latinos and [[Africa]]ns. All of them went through an 
extremely violent colonization process, they had (and still have) their 
territories occupied and exploited, they have serious problems related to the 
patriarchal [[mental]]ity. However, Rêber Apo’s ideas are not so well known in Latin
[[America]] and [[Africa]], due to the small or non-existent Kurdish community in these 
places. It is crucial that we try to connect with the existing struggles in 
these societies and develop together the alternatives to live free from the 
oppression and [[slavery]] of the capitalist system. Both continents have many 
stories of resistance, anti-colonial movements, guerrillas who fought for 
national [[liberation]] and original societies that still resist and try to keep 
their beliefs, way of life and form of organization alive.
 
These ideas would certainly be welcomed by the Latin and [[Africa]]n people, as 
women’s [[liberation]], ecology and freedom are issues that are already being 
addressed by existing movements. An easy example to note is the growing 
empowerment of feminist movements on both continents, as can be seen in Chile, 
[[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[South]] [[Africa]], etc. However, as much as they can mobilize 
millions of women in the streets and have achieved some improvements throughout 
[[history]], they still find themselves chained to the patriarchal system and 
unfortunately see dozens of women being [[kill]]ed every day by this disgusting 
system. It is not by chance that these movements know the Kurdish Women’s 
Movement well, and no doubt, from this awareness, more fruitful relations of 
unity, mutual aid, bases of international solidarity, etc. could be created. 
These would be the first steps towards leading a unified struggle against the 
patriarchal state and internationalizing the women’s [[revolution]] that is taking 
place in the Kurdish movement.
 
The problems caused by the capitalist [[mental]]ity can easily be observed, for 
example, the destruction of the environment and the global climatic consequences
generated by unrestrained exploitation in the name of so-called “progress”. The 
same term and the same [[mental]]ity that the colonizers had in the 16th century… 
with the passage of time, the terms could change, but the practice and the 
[[mental]]ity is usually the same until today.
 
The Global Revolt of ’68 and the Youth Spirit
 
As in [[Europe]], the front line of the struggles inspired by ‘68 in Latin [[America]] 
and [[Africa]] were young people. Bending their youthful spirit, their will to 
change, their dreams of [[revolution]] and hope, they were the heart of this moment 
and the first ones interested in building an alternative. But they lacked an 
understanding of the [[mental]]ity of the capitalist system as a whole, beyond 
mercantilism. So even though they had well-intentioned actions and attitudes, it
was not enough to break the system’s cycle and create a real alternative. This 
was the “mistake” the party understood, so that we could learn from it and the 
youth could redirect all their strength of spirit to [[revolution]]. At many points,
the youth occupied a crucial space in the struggle against the capitalist 
system. Among them, the most recent one was known as the Students’ Spring, where
thousands of schools were occupied by students from Chile, Brazil, [[Argentina]], 
[[South]] [[Africa]], Angola and some other countries, fighting for better educational 
conditions, a curricular table focused on their human and social capacities, 
which is totally opposite to the commercial logic established in our daily life.
The youthful spirit could be noticed in every action carried out by the 
students, from the reforms made in the abandoned public schools of the State to 
the physical resistance in the streets during the mobilizations where the police
used all their devices to attack them. This spirit is present in the youth up to
now. It is not by chance that those who initiated this gigantic and beautiful 
mobilization in Chile, and who have been occupying the “streets” for the last 
months until now, were the youth (most of them were women with 15 to 18 years 
old). Once again it is evident that there is a need for long-term proposals and 
projects, as well as a paradigm, otherwise these movements will have the same 
end as those of ‘68. Once again, we can clearly see the flames of hope. The hope
of building a true democratic alternative.
 
Since [[2008]], with the prolonged financial crises, all the relationships already 
established between capitalism, liberalism, sexism and conservatism have 
deepened and become polarized. Consequently, there is a more urgent need to 
understand the struggle in a deeper way and to learn from other experiences, 
especially the theories and practices of the Kurdish movement in the last 42 
years, in[[flu]]enced by thousands of years of historical resistance in defense of 
free and communal society.
 
[[United]] Line for the Democratic Nation
 
Democratic confederalism offers a way to organize these societies, respecting 
their characteristics and
[[multiculturalism]] . It is increasingly clear that Rêber Apo’s ideas, although 
developed from Kurdish society, can be applied to other societies because of 
their universalism, their recognition of the existence of differences in 
society, the importance of women’s [[liberation]] (without it, it is impossible to 
overcome the current state and system), the negation of dogmatic ideas and the 
creation of a [[revolution]]ary personality focused on its morals and ethics, one 
way of visualizing the veracity of this is, for example, the participation of 
internationalist hevals (friends) in the party and the exchange of experiences 
this creates within the party. This is one of the beautiful faces of the 
movement, the way everyone has a space and a voice within the party, in the 
struggle for human freedom. The natural characteristics of the Latin and [[Africa]]n
people, such as the joy of the people, the comradeship, the celebrational of 
life and an internal flame that calls for a change in society, would be more 
than welcomed by Rebêr Apo’s understanding and would complement with more 
colors, the rainbow that is the Kurdish struggle. People from all continents and
from all [[corn]]ers of the global earth working together, communally, to build a 
real alternative to the capitalist system.
