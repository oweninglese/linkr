Learning and the Creation of StockMarket Institutions: Evidence from the
Royal [[Africa]]n and Hudson 's [[Bay]]
Companies, [[1670]]-[[1700]]
ANN M. CARLOS, JENNIFER KEY, AND JILL L. DUPREE
In this article we use a unique source-a 30-year time series of the share transactions

of two joint-stock [[companies]]-to examine the growth of the London capital market
prior to and immediately after the Glorious Revolution. We argue that the London

experience with open capital markets was not solely the result of [[1689]]. Rather it was
the learning by private individuals and [[gold]]smith bankers which took place in the

decades before [[1689]] that allowed the market to take full advantage of the [[property]]
rights changes which occurred with the change in regimes.

Capital markets matter. Why they matter is evident in the linking of
financial markets and economic development within the theoretical

macro literature, in the development literature discussions on Latin [[America]]
and the Asian Tigers, and in the discussions of emerging markets in the

[[Eastern]] block countries.' The same coupling of finance and development is
clearly present in any discussion of [[British]] growth in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. England's emergence as an international trading nation
in the seventeenth century can be linked to the growth of trading arrange-

ments that allowed for a longer life of capital either as a regulated [[company]]
such as the Levant Company or in its purer form as a joint-stock trading
[[company]] such as the East India Companies.
It is, however, England's emergence as a world power in the early eigh-

teenth century that has been most closely tied to the financial, institutional,
and capital market changes that occurred at the end of the seventeenth century. Douglass [[North]] and Barry Weingast have argued convincingly that the

Glorious Revolution, by providing legal and [[property]] right changes, reduced
the power of the monarchy to default and thereby reduced the cost of

[[government]] borrowing. From [[1689]] on, the monarch could neither raise a

revenue nor declare martial law without [[parliament]]ary consent: limitations

on royal power that protected private [[property]] from arbitrary seizure.2 In
addition, others point out that William and Mary, by bringing with them

[[Dutch]] financial advisors, made current best practice available to the London
capital market; the chartering of the Bank of England ([[1694]]), the [[New]]

([[1698]]) and [[United]] ([[1708]]) East India Companies, and the [[South]] Sea Company (171 1) as joint-stock [[companies]] created the institutions necessary for

acquisition of public capital; while the restructuring of the Excise Department to improve tax collection and compliance provided the [[government]]
with the funds necessary to repay its war-related debt.3
The conjuncture of capital market evolution for private debt and the

Glorious Revolution is also explicit in the literature. [[North]] and Weingast
state that "the institutions leading to the growth of a stable market for public
debt provided a large and positive externality for the parallel development

of a market for private debt."4 In a recent work, City of Capital, Bruce
Carruthers argues even more starkly that the Glorious Revolution was a
turning point for the private capital market and the nation:
In [[1672]], there was no stock market in London, and England was a weak nation-state

and a second-rate military power. In [[1712]], only forty years later, the shares of many
joint-stock [[companies]] were [[trade]]d on an active and highly organized capital market
that had emerged in London. Furthermore, [[Great]] [[Britain]] had become one of the
major military powers in [[Europe]].5

Without in anyway reducing the significance of the changes engendered by
the Glorious Revolution for the financial and political [[history]] of London and

England, it is necessary to question the implicit, if not explicit, assumption
that the London capital market emerged Phoenix-like from the ashes of the
old regime.
How markets emerge is a critical question? Beyond a doubt, legal struc-

tures, [[property]] rights, and institutions are a funda[[mental]] part of the process
But to use a market, investors and firms must learn how to do so. Learning
and experience are, therefore, also critical for the development of a large

well-functioning market. The very different capital market experiences of
England and [[France]] in the wake of the [[South]] Sea and Mississippi Bubbles
can, perhaps, be attributed to a severe lack of [[French]] confidence and experience in what were seen as John Law's [[experiment]]s that were not present in
London.6 The [[French]] market became hostile to open financial markets,

while the London market grew to export capital to the world. The London

market not only survived the [[South]] Sea Bubble, it h
manent lack of investor confidence after the recoinage crisis of the 1 690s
and in the aftermath of the Stop of the Exchequer in [[1672]].

It is, of course, always difficult to examine the early years of any emerging market. The written documentation, especially price information, is
sparse. In this article, we use a unique source: the stock transfer patterns for
two joint-stock [[companies]] operating during the period from [[1670]] to [[1700]].
This source elucidates the organization of the stock market in the two
decades before the Glorious Revolution and for the decade following. The
information contained in the Royal [[Africa]]n and Hudson's [[Bay]] [[company]]

records allow us to present a micro-institutional examination of the early
market for stock. The records document the existence of all the institutional
features necessary for the operation of a modern securities market-legal
guarantees of transfer, active brokers, and sufficient dissemination of
infornation. Each transaction generated learning based on interaction with
others. Each transaction provided the basis for the growth of knowledge cap-

ital that could be thought of, in part, as a public good available in the coffee
houses of the period.

Because we provide, for the first time, a time series approach to the problem, we can examine the volume of activity over a 30-year period. We are

able to document the early and growing role played by [[gold]]smith bankers
as specialized brokers in this market. The records document activity in the
stock of both [[companies]], measured by the number of active [[trade]]rs, the volume of stock transferred by those [[trade]]rs, and the level of turnover in stock

holding. More importantly, these transfers do not represent activity arising
from [[death]] or inheritance, nor do the transfers represent attempts by suppliers or middlemen to achieve a privileged position within these [[companies]].
In fact, the market for these shares appears to be liquid and transparent and
the transfers seem to conform to the expectations of normal portfolio decisions on the part of an informed public. We are dealing here with only two
[[companies]], but other joint-stock [[companies]] existed, the largest of which was

the East India Company. If similar patterns of stock transfer occurred in
these [[companies]], the learning curve for participants and agents grows even
stronger.'
The next section briefly describes the political period in question and the
nature of the data used. This is followed by a detailed examination of the
stock-transfer patterns first for the Royal [[Africa]]n Company and then for the

Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, focusing, in part, on the role played by active
brokers in these shares.

'The largest joint-stock [[company]] was the East India Company. Unfortunately, however its transfer
books for this period have not survived.

COMPANY ORGANIZATION AND TRADE

All joint-stock [[companies]] needed to keep good records on stock o
ship.8 They had to know who might not yet have fully paid for a
tion, who was eligible to vote at the shareholders meetings, commonly
known as the General Court, and who should earn dividends. As a result the
stock owner lists and the transfer books of these Companies were well maintained and, to the extent that they survived, they contain important information. Unfortunately, because these are [[company]] records of who owned
what stock at which point in time, they do not include the price paid for the
stock. As will be seen below, whereas we have some information on price,
we have no continuous time series for share prices before [[1700]]. The first
continuous series date only from the early eighteenth century. Indeed, it is
this lack of price data that has been used to imply that there was no organized market. Yet it is only when the market grows beyond a certain size that
a printed price series is necessary.9
These transfer records have not been ignored. Huw Bowen used the transfer records of the East India Company to examine the connection between
investment and [[empire]] in the later eighteenth century. Kenneth Davies has
used them to look at some joint-stock investment patterns at the end of the
seventeenth century, and E. E. Rich and Davies use this same source in their
respective [[company]] histories of the Hudson's [[Bay]] and Royal [[Africa]]n [[companies]]. Often, however, these sources have been used for their social significance because they provide the names of those who were involved in these
[[companies]].10 These same records, however, also provide information on
market activity and become especially important when price data are
lacking.

The three decades from the chartering of the Royal [[Africa]]n Company
([[1672]]) and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company ([[1670]]) to the end of the century
were turbulent years. They cover the Glorious Revolution in [[1689]], the
[[Dutch]] [[War]]s, the Grand Alliance, and the [[War]] of the [[Spanish]] Succession,
which did not end until the [[Treaty]] of Utrecht in [[1713]]. On a financial front,

the period was equally one of uncertainty and change. There was the Stop
of the Exchequer in [[1672]], the questioning of the validity ofjoint-stock [[company]] charters after [[1689]], the chartering of the Bank of England ([[1694]]) to
improve [[government]] funding of war, the recoinage crisis of [[1696]], and [[parliament]]arv restrictions on stockbrokers and transactions in [[1697]]. DesDite
8 [[New]] stock was issued at par. However, subscribers were committed to paying a specified
percentage of the capital over a given time period. Thus all future payments were part of the asset
stream of the [[company]].

these events, the market for shares grew through the
here, exploding in the last decade of the century.

The Royal [[Africa]]n Company was chartered in [[1672]] and given a royal

monopoly of English [[trade]] along the west coast of [[Africa]] from modem-day
Senegal right down to Angola. Although the Royal [[Africa]]n Company had
a monopoly of [[British]] [[trade]], this was a monopoly in name only. The
[[company]] faced continuous competition all along the coast from the trading

ventures of other [[Europe]]an nations and [[British]] smugglers.11 This was not a
new venture. Prior to this charter, there had been a long [[history]] of English
joint-stock adventures to the [[Africa]]n coast, with the first Company of
Merchant Adventures for Guinie dating from the [[1550]]s.12 But due to war,
lack of finance, or poor management, none of these ventures was successful.
These earlier ventures, however, provided contact points and posts along the
coast and information about the potential for [[trade]] in [[Africa]].

Company [[trade]] had two distinct parts. First, there was a triangular [[trade]]
in which [[trade]] goods sent from England were exchanged for [[slaves]], who
were then transported to the West Indies and sold. The proceeds-in bullion,
bills of exchange, or [[sugar]]-were shipped to London for sale. Second, the
Company conducted a bilateral [[trade]] between London and [[Africa]], with
[[Europe]]an goods being exchanged for [[gold]], ivory, redwood, and malaguetta
(dye). Although generally considered a slave trading [[company]], the Royal
[[Africa]]n Company was, during this period, a multiproduct monopsonist with
[[slaves]] accounting for only 40 percent of total English [[trade]] with [[Africa]].13
The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company received its royal charter to [[trade]] for furs in
the drainage basin of Hudson [[Bay]] in [[1670]]. Unlike the Royal [[Africa]]n Company, this was a new venture, with only the reports of Pierre Esprit Radisson

and Medart Chouart Grosseilliers to provide information about trading potential around Hudson [[Bay]]. 14 Despite conflict with the [[French]], the Company
established trading posts around James [[Bay]] where it bartered [[Europe]]an [[trade]]

goods for furs which it then imported into England."5 The furs included
beaver, martin, bear, wolf, cat, wolverine, fox, and otter. Although many of
these were used in the fine garment [[trade]], beaver quickly became the primary fur by number and value. Beaver was used by the felting and hatting
industry that transformed the pelts into the finest quality wool felt hats that

English, it was only with the [[Treaty]] of Utrecht in [[1713]], which ended military conflict between these
two countries, that the Hudson [[Bay]] drainage basin was designated as [[British]] and the [[company]] resumed
control of all the posts around the bay.

remained high fashion for over two centuries. Although the [[company]]

charter giving it control of the lands in the drainage basin of Hudson Ba
the [[company]] faced physical and economic competition from the [[French]] in

[[Canada]], and competition in London and [[Europe]] from other major suppliers
of furs.

When these two [[companies]] were chartered, they became part of a small
group ofjoint-stock chartered [[companies]]. William Scott estimates that there
were only about 15 such [[companies]] before the explosion of the [[1690]]s. But
as Scott also points out, 15 is a very lower bound estimate because of the
"great extension of the joint-stock system in the formation of unincorporated

[[companies]]" for whom we do not have the same degree of documentation or
written records.'6 When the Royal [[Africa]]n Company was chartered in [[1672]],
it was second only to the East India Company in size. Unlike the East India
Company, however, the Royal [[Africa]]n never generated quite the same level
of political debate, which from the perspective of market development we
consider makes it an interesting [[company]] to study. Its charter called for a

paid-up capital of ?100,000 sold in ?100 units. The initial public offering
was, in fact, over subscribed, resulting in a capital stock of ?111,100 and
1,111 available shares. The capital stock was expanded by a stock split in
[[1691]] to ?444,400. In [[1693]] the [[company]] issued a further ?E180,850 of stock.
Then four years later, in [[October]] [[1697]], the [[company]] made a new issue of
stock with the intent of doubling the existing capital. However, not all of the

issue was taken up. As a result, the capital stock stood at ?1,101,050 at the
end of [[1697]].17

The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was much smaller, having an initial capital
stock one-tenth that of the Royal [[Africa]]n Company. The size of the initial
offering was ?10,500 again sold in ?100 units which resulted in 100.5 shares
available for market transactions. The small size of the venture probably has
much to do with the fact that this was a completely new venture with only
the barest of information about the area surrounding Hudson [[Bay]]. The
capital was expanded in [[1690]] by a stock split bringing the nominal capital
to ?31,500.18 By [[1691]], when the Royal [[Africa]]n Company was about onethird smaller than the East India Company, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was
about one-twenty-fifth the size. However, if one compares the Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company to the firms floated during the boom of the [[1690]]s, the Hudson's

[[Bay]] was, in fact, an average-sized venture.'9
16 Scott, Constitution, vol. 1, pp. 246, 327.

17 Ibid pp. 237, 26-27, 32-33.
18 Company capital was further expanded to ?103,950 via another stock split in [[1720]].
19 At the same time the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was not a small firm relative to the majority of the
[[companies]] chartered. Scott, Constitution, pp. 336-37, examined the financial and organizational
structure of all such [[companies]]. He estimated that in [[1695]] the paid-up capital for a total of 140 firms
was ?4,250,083. In that same year, the paid-up capital of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was ?31,500.
The average size of the remaining 139 firms was ?30,341, albeit with some variance.

As the largest joint-stock [[companies]], the East India Company, the Bank
of England, and the [[South]] Sea Company have dominated discussion. The
Bank of England was chartered only in [[1694]] and the [[South]] Sea Company

in [[1711]]. Together these were the monied [[companies]] of the early decades of
the eighteenth century. Yet, of these, only the East India Company was a
seventeenth-century [[company]] and unfortunately its transfer books for the

period have not survived.20 It is worth noting that both the Bank of England
and the [[South]] Sea Company were chartered as joint-stock [[companies]]. It was,
in fact, the availability of a standard, homogeneous and easily transferable

security that allowed for the dramatic increase in market activity in the eighteenth century. Thus, the Royal [[Africa]]n Company as the second largest of
the pre-Glorious Revolution period and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company as a

[[representative]] of the smaller [[companies]] are suitable subjects for study and
analysis.
ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY

Information on stock ownership in the Royal [[Africa]]n Company i
in its Transfer Book. This source, however, only covers the years [[1677]] to
[[1693]], but fortunately the Minute Books of the Court of Assistants recorded

transfers before [[1677]] and from [[1693]] until [[July]] [[1699]].21 Although the Company technically had to agree to all transfers, such a restriction was used
only in cases where the existing stockholder was in debt to the [[company]] or
had been accused of private [[trade]].22 There was for both the Royal [[Africa]]n
and Hudson's [[Bay]] [[companies]] easy and accessible transferability of shares.
To undertake a transfer, both the seller and the buyer (or his or her designated attorney) had only to sign the transfer book in the [[company]] office and

pay the transfer tax. Of course the buyer had to pay the seller, but this was
a private transaction.

The Royal [[Africa]]n Company recorded the date of the transaction, the
names of buyer and seller (but not their occupation or address), the amount

transferred, and whether all or part of the stock was being transferred.
According to Davies, about two 200 individuals responded to the initial
offering.23 The intention had been to call up the capital in ten installments
between [[January]] and [[August]] [[1672]], but because the outbreak of the Third
20 Dickson, Financial Revolution, p. 533, fn. 3. Dickson notes that only six transfer books survive
for the Old East India Company and none for the [[New]] prior to [[1723]], and none of the books covers a
period of more than nine months.
21 The Minute Books contain the same information given in the transfer book. However in [[July]] [[1699]],

the [[company]] ceases to record transfer information. There is a gap in the records until [[1703]], when it is
given in [[ledger]] form.

22 In the period studied here, the [[company]] became involved only once in a case where an individual
was accused of private [[trade]] and transfer of shares restricted.

[[Dutch]] [[War]] interfered with the [[company]]'s ability to [[trade]] to [[Africa]], the capital was called up over a longer period. Davies argues that many who subscribed must have been anticipating the war, perhaps with the hope that the

English would gain.[[Dutch]] territory in [[Africa]]. This was not to be. Despite the
fact that England lost and [[France]] gained, the capital was fully subscribed.24

The dividend lists for [[1676]] and [[1686]] each record 192 names. The list for
[[1676]] represents the [[company]] in the initial phase of its operations, and the

list for [[1686]] gives us a snapshot of ownership after ten years of operation.

We also use the dividend list for [[1692]]. This list is post-Glorious Revolution
and also incorporates the scrip dividend of [[1691]]. By [[1692]], the stock list had
expanded to 237 names.25 There were 82 similar names from the first to the
second dividend list. The second and third lists had 94 similar names. How-

ever, there were only 68 similar names on the first and third lists and only
50 names on all three. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century, London

was a large city and these roughly 200 names at any point in time represent
a small fraction of the mercantile and gentry community. But it must be
remembered that these lists represent a stock. What is important is not how

many held stock at a point in time, but turnover in ownership of shares over
these three decades. During the first three decades, there were 4,424 transactions among 1,200 different people. The Transfer Book notes when trans-

fers were undertaken by executors. Based on these notations, [[death]] and
inheritance played a very small role in deter[[mining]] the overall volume of

transactions. When considering learning and the spread of information, each
interaction represents the generation of knowledge between pairs of individuals, and trust in the operation of the market.

The actual transfer activity in Royal [[Africa]]n Company stock is shown in
Figure 1 and Table 1. The number of transactions in [[company]] stock rose in
each decade. There was an average of 40 transactions per year in the [[1670]]s,
72 per year in the [[1680]]s, and 340 per year in the [[1690]]s. The spike of over

900 transactions in [[1691]] dominates Figure 1. It was, undoubtedly, occasioned by the stock split of that year when the [[company]] gave each share-

holder ?300 of stock for each ?100 held. The spike in [[1698]] is probably also
best explained by the stock issue in [[October]] [[1697]]. In the case of both stock
splits and the new issue, dividends would be paid on the larger nominal

stock. Shareholders, however, were free to sell their shares and thus to realign their portfolio size and diversify their holdings. At the same time it is
evident that there were high levels of activity throughout the decade of the

[[1690]]s. The pattern over the three decades shows a growing number of transactions in each decade, which is compatible with a growth in knowledge and
learning by individuals both as investors and as intermediaries.

[[1691]], there were 928 transfers and 734 in [[1698]]. These are very similar n
bers for transactions almost three decades apart and supports a view of
active market in the [[1690]]s.

Although a consistent share-price series for the [[company]] does not e
there are a few individual price quotations. From [[1672]] to [[1689]], the price of
a ?100 share runs consistently above 100. For [[September]] [[1674]], Davies gives

the price as ?130. For [[October]] [[1677]], he lists it at ?170. By [[1680]] it had fallen
back to ?150, but by the end of the decade it had risen back to ?173. As one
would expect, once the [[company]] started to increase the nominal value of the
capital stock, the share prices fell. After the fourfold increase in shares in
[[1691]], Scott lists the price of a share in [[1692]] as between ?56 and ?44, which
is close to what one might expect if the presplit market price was ?173.
After the further stock issue in [[1697]], when the [[company]] attempted to double

the nominal value of the capital stock, the share price had fallen to ?14. A
stock split by itself would have reduced the price to ?28-22, but the deleterious effect of the war must have played a role. Indeed, until the wars of the
[[1690]]s, the market saw the Royal [[Africa]]n Company as reasonably profitble.27
the market as different. Interestingly, there is very little activity in Hudson's [[Bay]] Company shares
through [[1720]].

27 The [[company]] also sold an extra 1,850 shares in [[1693]]. These shares had a face value of ?100 but
were sold at 40. Davies, Royal [[Africa]]n Company, p. 72; and Scott, Constitution, vol. 2, p. 34.

The perception of the [[company]] as an unprofitable enterprise overall is the

result of reading the impact of the [[1690]]s back over the first two decades of
operation. This view is obvious in Davies's use of the word surprising in the

following comment: "the volume of transfers actually registered is surprisingly high and suggests an active market in the stock from the beginning."28
The transfer and price data presented here confirm the existence of a
growing, albeit small, market in Royal [[Africa]]n shares during the first two
decades that grew into a bull market in the [[1690]]s. The data, in addition,

allow us to look more closely into the structure of holdings. In addition to

financial rewards, stock ownership led to power within the [[company]]. The
[[company]] charter specified its legal and organizational structure and the vot-

ing rights of shareholders. At the head office level, joint-stock [[companies]]
were managed and directed by committees staffed by shareholders. Annually

the [[company]] elected a Sub-[[Governor]], a Deputy [[Governor]], and 24 Assistants, who were then allocated to one of the standing committees of the com-

pany-accounts, goods, shipping, and correspondence. Committee membership was limited to three years after which time, a shareholder had to withdraw for at least one year.29
28 Davies, Royal [[Africa]]n Company, p. 71.
29 If an Assistant was elected to be Deputy [[Governor]] or Sub-[[Governor]], then he could serve for
another two years; one at each level of [[Governor]].

The charter specified that individuals had one vote for each ? 100 share,
but to be elected Assistant, a shareholder had to hold ?400 of shares. This
regulation required those who wished to direct the [[company]] to show some
financial commitment to the [[company]]. Table 2 gives transactions at different

share sizes. More than 50 percent of the activity between [[1672]] and [[1691]] was
taking place in the ?100 to ?200 range, with 29 percent of transactions in the
?301 to ?500 range reflecting the election requirements. These data suggest
that people mainly held one or two shares in this [[company]] and were not
interested in control over the actual activities of the organization.
The Transfer Book provides the names of those who bought and sold
shares, so we are able to determine those who were most active in the market for [[company]] stock. Table 3 ranks shareholders by number of transactions and by value of transactions for the whole period. William Sheppard,
a [[gold]]smith banker, did the greatest volume of business by either measure.
He was involved in 612 transactions, five times greater than the next individual. William Sheppard is clearly a specialized broker or dealer in Royal
[[Africa]]n Company stock, involved in many small transactions. In fact, the av-

erage size of his transactions was only ?150. Table 4 gives his activity for
part of [[1691]]. A negative value represents a sale of stock by him. For part of
[[June]] and early [[July]], Sheppard was selling short, but thereafter he ran a posi-

tive balance. The other major brokers also maintained small positive balances. As a [[gold]]smith banker, Sheppard was involved in many aspects of the

financial market. As a result, he would have had access to many different
groups, and indeed he was the London agent for foreign investors, in particular for [[Dutch]] Jewish investors.30

In addition to William Sheppard, others active in [[company]] stock were
Samuel Storey, Sir John Sweetapple, Samuel Shephard, Peter Henriques, Jr.,

Lawrence Hatsell, and William des Boverie. Storey as the [[company]] husband
or secretary was a natural broker for [[company]] stock. Sweetapple and Henriques, on the other hand, were very important members of the financial

community. Sweetapple was a financier, involved in the Mediterranean
[[trade]], a Whig supporter and a dissenter, whereas Peter Henriques, Jr. was
a member of a noted Shepardic Jewish family well connected within financial circles. In fact, Henriques was another known agent for [[Dutch]] investors
in the first decade of the eighteenth century. Lawrence Hatsell was a scrivener with connections to the Mediterranean [[trade]] and William Des Boverie

a member of a noted Huguenot mercantile family. The most active shareholders in Royal [[Africa]]n stock were therefore all noted and active members

of the London mercantile community.31 Given their prominence, their activities in the share market must speak at least to its importance within the
financial sector.

Sheppard, Storey, Hatsell, and Des Boverie dominated activity as measured over the three decades. But the volume of activity in the last decade
swamp the transactions in the previous two decades. To provide a more
balanced picture, Table 5 presents those who were most active by value and
volume for each decade. Looking at the years [[1672]] to [[1679]], Sir William

Goulston and Sir Robert Vyner were involved in the largest [[trade]]s by value.
Both men were important within the financial community. Sir Robert Vyner
was possibly the most important [[gold]]smith banker of the period. He was a
major creditor of the [[Crown]] and was the person most affected by the Stop

of the Exchequer in [[1672]] with ?416,725 in loans to the king coming from
the deposits of over 628 persons.32

Sir William Goulston was the most important [[trade]]r by value and in the
top five in terms of number of transactions. Goulston, it is said, took after
his mother's family and became a London merchant. By [[1671]] he was involved in foreign [[trade]]. B. D. Henning, in his biographical [[history]] of members of Parliament, remarks that Goulston's "association with the [[Africa]] and

East India Companies must have been profitable; in the seventies he was

Another very interesting case is that of John Bull. Bull was a merchant involved in the selling of East India Company goods and [[Turkey]] carpets.

Although John Bull was elected to the Court of Assistants in [[1673]] and [[1674]],

his activity thereafter is similar to other active [[trade]]rs. Yet rather than seeing

Bull as a broker in Royal [[Africa]]n stock, Davies sees Bull as buying and selling solely to manage his own portfolio, remarking that Bull "raised or
lowered (his) holdings in accordance with (his) expectations of short-run
change." Yet Davies also notes that Bull "bought in [[1675]] and [[1676]] only to
resell immediately."34 John Bull, along with Lord Berkeley, Goulston, and

Sir Gabriel Roberts, was a broker in Royal [[Africa]] stock. None of these

people specialized only in Royal [[Africa]]n Company stock, the market was

too small for that. Trading in Royal [[Africa]]n stock was just one of their mercantile or financial activities during these decades.
The increase in trading activity already noted in the aggregate stock is also

evident in the activities of the top five shareholders for the [[1680]]s. John Bull

and Lord Berkeley continue to be major players, but the most active by
either measure is Sir William Langhome. Davies writes: "Harbingers of a
new feature in English social life were Sir William Langhome, Sir Jeremy

Sambrooke and Streynsham Master, who on their return from service in
India invested part of the proceeds in [[Africa]]n stock. They were not 'nabobs'
by eighteenth-century standards," but "at the market prices prevailing just

before the Revolution (his) investments must have been worth about

?40,000."35 Davies states that Langhome had ?4,000 in Royal [[Africa]]n stock.
In keeping with his view that an active capital market was not present in the

[[1670]]s and [[1680]]s, Davies sees these shareholders as making personal
investment decisions rather than acting as active brokers. Yet with 41 transactions, Langhome can be considered an active [[trade]]r and broker, making
commissions on his [[trade]]s. The same can be said for Hall and Hayward.

The decade after the Glorious Revolution saw a dramatic increase in the
level of transactions. This is due, in part, to the [[company]] stock split, but also
to an increase in the level of aggregate activity. Again one sees the names of
in[[flu]]ential members ofthe financial and mercantile community: Sheppard, Da

Costa, Nunez, and Jefferies. All of the active [[trade]]rs within each decade were
men with other activities. One could argue that they would only be involved
in Royal [[Africa]]n Company stock if it were worth their time. Their presence

is strong evidence for an active and transparent capital market prior to the
Glorious Revolution. The activity of the early [[1690]]s also documents an active
market prior to the chartering of the Bank of England. One might even argue

that the Bank structure stems from knowledge of the market rather than
creating the market. If we consider the infonnation and learning generated

mercantile community. [[War]]rants, as the payments to merchants were called,

not only describe the interlocking relationship of firms in seventeenth-century London, but they also allow us to explore whether there was a relation-

ship between selling to the [[company]] and owning stock.36 The warrant lists

give the names of approximately 1,500 individuals and [[companies]] from
whom the [[company]] purchased commodities from [[1672]] to [[1692]].37 Crosslisting the names of those who sold to the Royal [[Africa]]n Company with the

shareholder list, we found that there were only 150 individuals who come
up on both lists over these three decades. This means that about 12 percent
of the shareholders were involved commercially with the [[company]], and only
10 percent of those selling to the [[company]] were also shareholders. If indi-

viduals were purchasing stock to acquire preferential business opportunities

with the [[company]], one might have expected this number to be larger.38 Furthermore, only 28 of the 1,500 merchants who sold to the Royal [[Africa]]n

Company owned stock in both the Royal [[Africa]]n and Hudson's [[Bay]] [[companies]], even though the range of commodities purchased by each was similar. The low level of correlation between those who sold commodities to the

[[company]] and those who purchased shares downplays the argument that
share transactions were taking place for commercial gain and reinforces the
argument that these transactions were market driven activities that were part
of some individual investor's portfolio decisions.39
There is strong evidence of activity in the stock of this [[company]] and also,

as we shall see below, for the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company. The fact that we see
such levels of activity implies that individuals were able to get information
about the state of the market for each [[company]]. In fact, John Houghton
pointed out in [[April]] [[1692]]: "they that live at London, may, every Noon and
Night on Working days, go to Garraways's Coffee House, and see what

prices the Actions bear of most Companies trading in Joynt-Stocks."40 Not
only were the coffee houses sources of information on prices of shares, but
merchants drinking there would also have been able to assess the funda-

[[mental]]s of the [[companies]]. The volume of [[trade]] goods purchased for shipment to [[Africa]], India, or Hudson's [[Bay]] would be known within the mercantile community. The volume and value of [[trade]] goods brought back to Lon36 For a discussion of the structure of [[company]] buying practices see Carlos and Key, "Firm."

3' The commodities purchased include iron, copper, brass and pewter, [[British]] textiles, East India
[[company]] textiles, gun powder, firearms, and knives, beads and cowries, as well as shipping supplies
for the trip.

38 It is clear from looking at the warrant data that the [[company]] did make some very large purchases

annually from merchants who were also shareholders. But not all of the major vendors by SIC grouping

were shareholders. Also some of the [[company]]'s largest purchases were with the East India Company.

don would be equally known as these goods were most often sold by public
auction. Information was available and the coffee houses provided a focal

point for transmission of that information. The growing levels of activity
indicate, in turn, that individual investors were able to assimilate the avail-

able information.
HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY

The Transfer Book of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company came into existence in
[[July]] [[1673]] when the General Court (the annual shareholders meeting)
ordered that "all assignements that shall bee made in this stocke by any
Adventurers to any other person either amonge themselves or otherwise, the
same shall bee signed . . . in a booke that shall bee provided for that

purpose."4l The records give the date on which the transfer was registered,
the amount of stock being transferred, and the names of the vendor and
purchaser, along with whether all or part of the vendor's stock was being
sold. The occupation of those involved and their addresses were given for
most of the transactions.

Because the record of stock transfers does not begin until [[July]] [[1673]], we

have only limited information on the ownership patterns during the first two

and half years of operation. The Charter lists 18 persons as initial subscribers, and the dividend list for [[1690]] has 29 names. By [[1701]], there were

67 shareholders. The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was smaller than the Royal
[[Africa]]n Company, but transactions in its stock show the same patterns of
learning and growth in activity. These relatively small numbers have led to
arguments that the [[company]] was small and closely held, but the numbers
belie the amount of activity in the [[company]]'s stock. Indeed, only four of

those who had initially purchased stock in the [[company]] held it to the end of
our period. During the first three decades, the Transfer Book lists approximately 400 people as having held stock, between whom are recorded 925
transactions. Our analysis of the records show that [[death]] and inheritance

accounts for only about 6 percent of all listed transfers or about 7 percent of
the total volume of shares [[trade]]d.42
Transfer activity is shown in Figure 2 and Table 6. Activity is very evident during the decade of the [[1680]]s, when transfers amounted to three times

the value of the stock, and in the [[1690]]s when the stock turned over four
times. The high levels of activity in the early [[1690]]s were again, in part, the
result of [[company]]-specific actions. In [[September]] [[1690]], the committee decided to treble the nominal value of the stock "as hath been designed some

years since". The decision to enlarge the stock came from a desire to quell

Dividends were paid on the enlarged shareholdings and shareholders were
free to sell these new shares. The spike shows how eager individuals were
to buy into the [[company]], but a sizable amount of activity continued for the
remainder of the decade. The trading pattem seen here mirrors that observed
for the Royal [[Africa]]n Company lending support to the argument that we are,

in fact, observing a growth in overall market activity.
The [[1690]]s is the only decade in the seventeenth century for which we

have some share price data for the [[company]]. Scott reports that in [[March]] and
[[April]] [[1692]] the price of ?100 of trebled stock was ?260. By [[January]] [[1693]]
this had fallen to ?190 and by the end of the decade the price was hovering

around ?100.44 The one price reference given in the Transfer Book is for
[[April]] [[1688]] just two years before the stock split. It was noted that a ?100
share was valued at ?500. In an efficiently functioning market, we would expect the price per share to decline with a trebling of the nominal value of the

stock. It appears that from the end of the [[1680]]s through the early [[1690]]s, the

quotations that he attributed to the decline in public interest in the stockmarket after the crisis of

Hudson's [[Bay]] Company was seen as profitable by the market.45 Even in
[[1700]], a single share was still valued by the market at 1 00. In his [[history]] of

the [[company]], Rich has argued that after [[1690]] "the marked feature of the
stock was that it was not 'active' even at the high price obtainable".46 This
is clearly inaccurate. In [[March]] [[1692]], for example, when the price of a share

was 260, there was a record 92 transactions and, as shown, a high level of
activity continued for the rest of the decade.

For this [[company]] too, its charter specified its legal and organizational
structure and the voting rights of shareholders. A governor and a committee
of seven elected at an annual meeting held "between the first and last Day

of [[November]]" made all operational decisions.47 These decisions included,

for example, what [[trade]] goods to buy from whom, which ship or ships to
hire, when to have the [[company]] sales, and how much money to borrow.
Again it could thus be argued that individuals merely bought shares in the

[[company]] because of the potential for remunerative commercial links and so

to gain preferential [[treatment]] either in terms of fur sales or in the purchase
of [[trade]] goods shipped to Hudson [[Bay]]. Although we unfortunately do not
have the same information as we do for the Royal [[Africa]]n Company, there
is no evidence that shares were a necessary precondition for [[company]]

business. None of the [[company]] minutes links shareholding and purchases,
and the high turnover in shares also suggests that this was not the case.

Although the [[trade]] goods purchased were many and varied, the [[company]]'s
output was not. Furriers as a group were the main purchasers of Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company furs.48 This group may have seen share ownership as a way to
acquire the best furs at the lowest prices. To examine the extent of share own-

ership by furriers and indirectly to test whether this group may have held
shares in order to gain in[[flu]]ence within the [[company]], we examined the [[company]]'s fur sale records.49 The fur sale records give the names ofthose who pur-

chased various lots at the [[company]] sales. Roughly 300 different individuals
bought furs from the [[company]] over this 30-year period. Within this group only

46 were shareholders. This represents about 11 percent of those who ever
owned shares or 15 percent of those who bought furs. But within this small
group nearly half were also members of the board of directors.i0

A small number of furriers, therefore, were active within the [[company]].
But their ability to use their position to buy the best furs cheaply or outside
market channels was restricted. Parliamentary legislation, a result of lobbying by small felters, required that the [[company]] sell its furs at twice yearly

auctions in small lot sizes. In addition if any sales did take place outside of

the auction, the price could be no lower than the previous auction price.51 It
must also be remembered that the organization of these [[companies]] required
some shareholders to sit on the board of directors, and furriers as a group
48 Interestingly, there is no occupation listed in the Transfer Book as furrier. Either they gave no
occupation or listed their occupation as merchant.

49 From [[1736]], the [[company]] kept a separate Fur Price Booke, PAC [[HBC]] MG20 A, Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company Records. Prior to that point, a record of sales is to be found among entries in the Grand
Journal, PAC MG20 A 15, Hudson's [[Bay]] Company Records.
50 This might account for the more active role played by the hatter\felter group in trying to detennine

[[company]] policy through [[parliament]]ary activity. An interesting issue that arises is why felters chose a
[[parliament]]ary route while the furriers used internal in[[flu]]ence. Although some felters owned stock, they

did not become involved in the internal operations of the [[company]]. The constraint might lie in the
financial resources available to members of each group. Furriers as a group were much wealthier than
the hatter and felters. Personal or firm wealth would then allow a furrier to buy a greater number of

shares, which would both allow him to have a greater number of votes and to become a director.
5 Felters and hatters seemed more concerned about pelts being shipped to [[Europe]]. At the beginning
of [[company]] operations, there was a demand for pelts in Archangel and in [[Amsterdam]] and furs were
exported for sale there.

clearly had an interest in the successful operation of the [[company]]. Overall
there is no evidence that a select number of shareholders were able to buy

or sell to the [[company]] on favorable terms.
A shareholder only needed a ?100 share to be able to vote at the General
Court, but [[company]] by-laws required that anyone who wanted to be elected
as a committee member and thus have decision-making power within the
[[company]], had to have at least ?300 of stock.52 Information on size of the
shareholdings being transferred, given in Table 7, shows that during the first
two decades the largest amount of activity was in ?100 blocks followed by
the ?101 to ?299 range as for the Royal [[Africa]]n Company. The Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company, unlike the Royal [[Africa]]n Company, did allow people to add
together one half or one-quarter shares to generate a ?1 00 unit to buy into
the [[company]], vote, and earn dividends. And so there is activity at this end
of the market suggesting that the market was structured in such a way as to
let investors purchase small stakeholdings. The occupational listings show

that drapers, fishmongers, and mercers as well as [[gold]]smiths, merchants,
and gentry owned stock.53
52 Rich, Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, vol. 1, p. 89.
53 The occupational listing of those who owned stock was very diverse. There were apothecaries,
brewers, cardwyners, chandlers, drapers, distillers, doctors, felters, fishmongers, grocers, gunpowder-

makers, habedashers, ironworkers, marines, mercers, sailmakers, tailors, upholsterers, and waxchandlers. There were also a few [[company]] employees who owned shares.

During the decade of the [[1690]]s, the amount of activity in the larger block
sizes increased. However, we must be careful in making inferences from
this. The stock split trebled the value of stock held by an individual shareholder that was bound to have an in[[flu]]ence on the level of activity and the
size of block that the individual shareholder could sell. When we look at
activity normalized for the increase in shares held, we see that shareholders
were selling proportionally smaller blocks of stock. Overall there was
greater activity and more people were able to buy into the [[company]], which
was the original intention.

These transactions data again document the growing importance of [[gold]]smiths and scriveners as brokers. Goldsmiths and scriveners were involved
in only 19 percent of the transactions during the first two decades, but this
grew to 57 percent of the transactions during the [[1690]]s. When buyers and
sellers of Hudson's [[Bay]] shares are listed by number of transactions and by
value (Table 8), the top two individuals were William Sheppard and John
Smith who were a [[gold]]smith and scrivener, respectively. Not discounting
the role played by merchants in the capital market, three of the ten shareholders by value of transactions were [[gold]]smiths. Sheppard, Smith, Evance,
and Sweetapple together accounted for 54 percent of transfers, while
Sheppard and John Smith were together responsible for 19 percent of all

transactions.54 Indicative of their role as brokers is the fact that most o

sales were made to a very diffused group of individuals.55 One of the m

brokers of Hudson's [[Bay]] Company stock was the same William Sheppard
who was so involved in the Royal [[Africa]]n Company. Sir Stephen Evance
and Sir John Sweetapple were also active [[trade]]rs in both stocks.

Although the numbers of people who held stock at any point in time was
small, the turnover during this period was high and similar to the Royal
[[Africa]]n Company growing across each of the decades. Looking over the last
three decades of the seventeenth century, the quantitative evidence points to
a liquid market for Hudson's [[Bay]] Company shares. The market would also

appear to have been reasonably transparent with certain [[gold]]smiths acting
as brokers. Certainly for the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company during these three
decades, Adam Smith appears to have been wrong when he contended that

"a joint stock [[company]], consisting of a small number of proprietors, with a
moderate capital, approaches very nearly to the nature of a private

copartnery."56
CONCLUSIONS

We argue here that the English, or more properly, the London e
with open capital markets was not the creation of [[1689]]. Rather, by
the London capital market had developed both the knowledge capital or

learning and the institutional arrangements that allowed it to take full
advantage of the legal and [[property]] rights changes that occurred with the

Glorious Revolution, which resulted in the explosion of security trading in
the last decade of the seventeenth century. Dickson has argued that "big
increase in the market after [[1688]] was built on existing foundations" and that

"contemporaries were so impressed by the swift moving events in which
they were caught up that they tended to ignore this, and to treat the market

as a new phenomenon."57 Contemporaries are possibly not alone in ignoring
the decades prior to [[1689]]. It may seem trivial to argue that London had a
functioning capital market prior to the Glorious Revolution. Yet it is an im-

portant observation and, in fact, complements the growing body of work on
the size and development of the London bullion market in the seventeenth
century.58 London was not [[Amsterdam]], but neither was it Paris.

an excessively negative view of these activities, when in fact these individuals were acting as brokers.

the size of the market the majority of the dealers were London merchants or [[gold]]smith bankers.

The discussion of stock transfer patterns in the Royal [[Africa]]n and
Hudson's [[Bay]] Company indicates a market for these shares that started
small but grew over the three decades examined. There is clear evidence of
turnover of the stock, easy and legal transferability of securities, active

brokers, information available through [[company]] sales and purchases of [[trade]]
goods and in the local coffee houses. For both [[companies]], the active brokers

were in[[flu]]ential and knowledgeable members of the financial community.
Perhaps more than anything else, their role speaks to the fact that there was

knowledge and ability on the one side and learning by individuals on the
other. As central figures in the bullion [[trade]], [[government]] securities, and
[[gold]]smith banking, these men were able to act as conduits between different
segments of the market. Their activities were also mirrored by equally in[[flu]]ential members of the mercantile community.

The key is learning. Individual investors learned how to make (and lose)
money in ways that did not directly involve productive processes. They

learned how to share risk in commercial and financial endeavors; how to
buy and sell, and where to buy and sell. They learned about the financial
rewards and losses they could incur. Concomitant with this was the learning

by specialized brokers who managed the [[trade]] during these early years. The
[[gold]]smith bankers increased their expertise in the equity section of the
market. In contrast one can think of the rather feeble attempts of such men

as Humphrey Gilbert and Walter Raleigh to garner funds for mixed trading
and colonizing ventures in the [[1580]]s. The failure of Gilbert's [[New]]foundland

Folly, and Raleigh's "Lost Colony" at Roanoke pointed out the futility of
relying on a small circle of West Country gentry for funds. The need for improved organization and larger stocks of capital became clear, and resulted
in the formation of private corporations. Yet many of these, such as the
Dorchester Adventurers and the [[New]] England Company, proved short-lived.

The charter of the Virginia Company actually committed that organization
to a seven-year lifespan. The Virginia Company was continually starved for

capital and went bankrupt 17 years after its first charter was issued.59
It cannot be a coincidence that the equity segment of the market increased
so dramatically in the [[1690]]s. This decade witnessed an unprecedented increase in the number of joint-stock enterprises. The changes implemented

by the Glorious Revolution were matched by growth in overseas markets
and in the market for domestic securities. For men such as William

Sheppard, his prosperity depended on England's overseas [[trade]], while England's prosperity depended, to some extent, on people such as Sheppard. He

and other financiers monitored the economic conditions in [[Africa]] and the

[[Canadian]] interior. As a result of these forces, Houghton, by the middle of
59 We wish to thank Virginia Anderson for her extremely helpful suggestions concerning learning
and [[company]] formation.

[[1694]], was able to quote the share prices of nearly 60 [[companies]], many of
them recently floated.60 Interestingly, Dickson observes that "in the early
period it may well have seemed that the market would in future center on

[[company]] flotations, and that dealings in [[government]] securities would gradually decline once the war ended. In fact, the reverse occurred. The age of
reason was also an age of war." Government demands for funds were vora-

cious.6' It was to take nearly two centuries before the London market would
come to be dominated by [[company]] flotations. The lessons learned in the
three decades discussed in this article must surely have helped to construct

the market. This learning must also have provided the experience that
allowed investors to deal with various financial crises in terms of regulation
rather than market rejection.
