Abstract. Pricing behaviour at three Hudson's Bay Company trading posts is examined
in terms of a model of long-run profit maximization of a depletable resource. At Fort
Churchill, where the company acted as a monopsonist purchaser of furs from the Indians,
rising European fur prices had little impact on prices paid to Indians, and beaver stocks
in the hinterland were maintained. At Fort Albany and York Factory, where the company
faced competition from French traders, prices at the posts were raised, and the beaver was
depleted. These outcomes are consistent with optimal pricing behaviour by the companiy.
The lack of well-defined Native property rights to the beaver was a crucial element.

1. Introduction
The trade in Canadian beaver was based on European demand. Furs were shipped
from Hudson Bay or down the St Lawrence and across the Atlantic eventually to

be transformed into the high-fashion beaver hats that remained popular in England

and the Continent for almost two centuries. What happened in the European market,
moreover, played back into the primary market, shaping Native American reponses
and determining the level of extraction of the resource. Harold Innis (1956) and E.E.
Rich (1958), in their seminal works, examined how European companies conducted
the fur trade, but they downplayed the role of Indian custom and practice. This is
in contrast to much of the recent research that treats Native groups as central

players rather than passive agents.' Emphasizing the role of Indians is clearly as
it should be, given that it was they who hunted the animals and sold the furs to

the Europeans. Further, the Native North American experience in the fur trade
has broad implications for the way institutional arrangements can affect natural

resource use. We have much to learn, therefore, from the interrelationships among
Native groups and among the Europeans with whom they traded, relationships that

ultimately determined harvesting rates of the beaver and other animals.
Historians have long been aware that it was the actions of Indians that directly

led to depletion, but recently the question has become: Why did Native peoples not

conserve the fur-bearing animals on which their livelihood was based?2 This issue
was first addressed in the ethnohistory literature, notably by Calvin Martin, who

specifically rejected an economic explanation for depletion, arguing instead that
'the mutually courteous relationship between man and animal' had broken down

(Martin 1978, 19). Martin's view that a spiritual rift between man and the animal
stock was to blame for depletion led to considerable debate and has been generally
rejected (Krech 1981); but so far no alternative account of Indian behaviour has
received wide support. In Carlos and Lewis (1993), we contributed to the debate by
estimating beaver populations in the hinterlands of three Hudson's Bay Company

trading posts over the years 1700 to 1763 (see figures 1 and 2). It is not surprising
that the introduction of a commercial trade led to a decline in beaver stocks, an

outcome that in itself does not imply depletion.3 But in two of the hinterlands those served by Fort Albany and York Factory - there were further declines, mainly
in the latter part of the period. By contrast, the population in the Fort Churchill

hinterland remained close to the maximum sustained-yield level. In our paper we
documented the impact of a French presence near Fort Albany and York Factory.
Hudson's Bay Company managers raised the prices paid to the Indians for furs and
the Indians responded with increased harvests. Ultimately, beaver stocks declined,
but overharvesting occurred only where there was competition between the English
and the French traders.

In this paper we explore the forces that discouraged conservation by Native
peoples and European trading companies. An important influence was the rising

demand for furs in Europe.4 We interpret the imDact of this EuroDean demand
1 For a list of references and a brief discussion of this literature, see Rea (1991, topic 6).

2 Following the conventional interpretation in the natural resource literature, depletion implies an
animal population below the level that provides the maximum harvest on a sustainable basis. We
apply the same benchmark to the terms 'overharvesting' and 'overexploitation.'

3 Our estimates of beaver populations are based on harvesting rates of beaver, contemporary discussions of beaver biology, and other evidence (Carlos and Lewis 1993).
4 There was a market for beaver in Asia and the West Indies, but it was much smaller than the
European market (Lawson 1943, appendix G).

by deriving the Hudson's Bay Company's long-run, profit-maximizing, strategies,
where the company is treated as a price taker in the European market. Our theoretical results argue that at trading posts, where the company was a monopsonist,
its optimal strategy was to set prices roughly consistent with a maximum sustained
yield beaver population. The European market would thus have little impact on
the North American price. But in the presence of French traders, which we treat

as a competitive fringe to the dominant Hudson's Bay Company, the relationship
between the European and the North American price was different. For the same

European price, the profit-maximizing price at the company post was higher than
in the pure monopsony case, and the beaver stock was lower. In addition, the North
American price should have been more sensitive to the European market.

The evidence, drawn from Hudson's Bay Company records and other sources, is
consistent with these theoretical implications and highlights the vulnerability of a
resource base to uncontrolled extraction by primary hunters. Before 1725 European
prices were low, but subsequently the price of beaver pelts increased, mainly in
response to rising demand for beaver hats, and by the 1750s the Hudson's Bay
Company was selling pelts in London at prices two and even three times those of
earlier years. These price increases, which were largely exogenous to the Hudson's

Bay Company because it occupied a small share of the European market, had
differential effects at the trading poStS.5 Where the company was a monopsonist,
as at Fort Churchill, it was able through its pricing policies to maintain the animal
stocks close to the biological optimum; but in areas where the company faced
competition from the French, as in the hinterlands of Fort Albany and York Factory,

increases in the European price led to higher prices at the posts and to depletion.
5 Trade data for our period is incomplete, but the work of Wien and Pritchard (1987) for 1772 is
suggestive of the orders of magnitude. In that year the value of furs sent from Hudson Bay ac-

counted for less than 10 per cent of the total value of furs exported from North America to England. If the comparison is restricted to beaver pelts, the share was less than 20 per cent. Although

Wien and Pritchard warn that Hudson's Bay Company exports may have been undervalued, there
is an offsetting bias in that the comparison does not include exports from North America that
were sent to markets outside England. Moreover, it excludes imports of furs to England and
western Europe from Russia and Scandinavia. Wien (1987, 89) presents data on the export of furs
from Quebec during the period 1728 to 1755 that are consistent with the 1772 numbers.

Property rights, competition, and depletion 709

A higher European price increased the wedge between the price the French

marchands received for their furs and the price paid to the Indians in terms of tra
goods. This wedge allowed the French greater market penetration, since it became
profitable for them to move further into the interior. In response, the Hudson's Bay
Company could either limit the price it paid to the Indians, in which case it would
lose market share to the French, or raise the price to protect its market, which risked

depletion of the animal stock through increased harvesting. The profit-maximizing
response of the company involved a compromise between the objectives of market

share and conservation. The evidence on prices at Hudson's Bay Company trading
posts suggests a policy, whether by deliberate intention or not, that was close to
this optimal strategy.

In addition to the policies of the Hudson's Bay Company, and the primary cause
of depletion, was the lack of well-defined property rights among aboriginals in the

region. They could have chosen, after all, to control their extraction rates; Native
groups in other locations and time periods apparently did so. Unfortunately, as we

outline below, the forces peculiar to this region and time limited the ability of

Natives in the Hudson Bay lowlands to establish the property rights that would
have led them to conserve the fur resource.

2. From Utrecht to Paris: implications for Native property rights

In a now famous paper, Harold Demsetz (1967) argued that formal property rights
would emerge if the benefits of such rights exceeded the costs. Citing the work of

Eleanor Leacock (1954), Demsetz pointed out that some Indian groups established
well-defined property rights when the commercial fur trade was introduced and thus

controlled their level of resource extraction. He noted, in particular, the actions of
the Montagnais in Labrador and tribes on the northwest coast to illustrate the
emergence of new land tenure arrangements in the face of increasing resource
values.

Territoriality by different Native groups is an issue that has long concerned

anthropologists.6 As Morantz (1986, 72) documents, the eastern James Bay Cree
had a notion of trespass; and Bishop (1986) cites instances where Native groups demanded 'gifts' or tolls to secure passage through their territory. Elsewhere, William

Cronin (1983, 105) quotes fur trader Joseph Chadwick, who in 1764 described how

Maine Indians divided their land into heritable family hunting territories: 'their
hunting ground and streams were all parcelled out to certain families, time out
of mind [in the distant past].' Thus, within the anthropological record, there are

examples of institutional structures that could have promoted conservation.7
Some tribes found it difficult to control extraction rates because of the 'Good
Samaritan' principle in Indian culture (McManus 1972; Moranz 1986). The precariousness of the food base, on which all Indians depended, meant that survival came
6 The question began with whether 'family hunting areas' predate European contact or whether
such organizational forms arose post contact (Speck 1915; Leacock 1954).
7 A special issue of Anthropologica (Anthropologica, New Series 28, 1986) is devoted to the function and operation of Native hunting territories.

first; and, as a response, an Indian was permitted to hunt for food on another's

territory. This social institution limited the range of privilege of Native groups to
their land and ultimately affected not just the ownership of the beaver resource but
also its exploitation.

Conflict among Europeans and Natives also may have limited the Indians' security of tenure to their resources. The Hudson's Bay Company was established in
1670; but its first forty years were stormy, as competition with the French became
an extension of the ongoing European conflict. Although the Treaty of Utrecht
in 1713 declared the Hudson Bay basin British territory, competition with French
traders continued until the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1763, marking the end

of the French and Indian Wars (Rich 1958, vol. 1).8 Rivalries among Europeans,
which predated the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company, provoked tension and,

ultimately, warfare among Native groups (Heidenreich 1987a).9 Originally conducted for reasons of prestige, revenge, and religion, the fighting changed in purpose

and increased in intensity after European contact. Although much of the conflict
took place outside the Hudson Bay hinterland, tribes within the hinterland appear

to have been affected by the instability.10
Two other cultural and social forces apparently reduced the ability of Native
groups to conserve the resource base. The first stemmed from the aboriginal ethic

of generosity. Generosity, whether seen in mortuary feasts or in the treatment of
visitors, enhanced the status of those aspiring to be chiefs. The fur trade provided

new opportunities to such people (Bishop 1986, 56). But the acquisition of goods
required pelts as exchange, reducing the inclination of these Indians to conserve the

beaver. Some anthropologists have argued that the ability to conserve fur-bearing
animals was also lessened by a Native spiritual belief in reincarnation: animals
killed now would reappear in the future.

Conflict, the 'Good Samaritan' principle, an ethic of generosity, and possibly a

belief in reincarnation combined to produce a regime in which Indians, with few
exceptions, placed little value on the future stock of animals. Instead, they operated
under a system, equivalent to open access, that may not have been in their longrun interest. But, as argued above, the animal populations could still have been
maintained. The European traders, especially the Hudson's Bay Company, could
control the harvests and, therefore, the animal stocks through the price paid to the

Indians for furs. So even though the Indians may have regarded the animals as
an open-access resource, depletion was not inevitable and did not always occur.
8 Of course, the rivalry with traders operating out of Montreal continued until the merger of the
Hudson's Bay and Northwest companies in 1821. See Carlos and Hoffman (1986).
9 The Huron, the Ottawa valley bands, some Montagnais, and the Susquehannock, all of whom

traded with with French, were loosely allied against the five Iroquois tribes, who acted as middlemen for the English. In the Michigan peninsula, tribes that included the Neutral, Petun, and

Ottawa also became involved in conflict.
10 With the penetration by the French into the area west of the Great Lakes, and their resulting
treaty with the Saulteaux and the Cree, war broke out between the Saulteaux and the Dakotas,
who felt that their trade with the English was threatened. This conflict caused the migration of
some of the Ojibwa groups into Cree territory west of Lake Superior, which was part of the
Hudson Bay hinterland. For a description of the conflicts and their effects see White (1991).

But the analysis of these issues requires that we turn from the actions of Native
trappers and focus on the policies of the Europeans.

3. The price of furs in Europe and at the Bay
The Hudson's Bay Company was a latecomer to the fur trade. The larger European

market was already well-established by 1670, with supplies coming from New
France, the Continental colonies, northern Europe, and Russia. What the Hudson's
Bay Company had to offer this market was a supply of top-quality pelts, mainly
beaver but including marten and other furs. Beaver was the best of the staple furs,

furs whose wool could be transformed into felt for use by the hatting industry."1
Each pelt has a double coating of hair: short, soft, barbed hair close to the skin,

which is protected by longer, stiffer, smoother hair called guard hair. Only the
short hair could be felted, and one problem was to separate it from the guard hair
and the pelt. The guard hair could be removed mechanically, but separation also

occurred when the Indians wore the beaver pelts as clothing."2 Over the course
of a year, the pelt would become greasier and more pliable and eventually the
guard hairs would fall out. This type of pelt, known as castor gras, or coat beaver,
was differentiated from a freshly caught pelt, known as castor sec, or parchment

beaver. Beaver hats were produced with a combination of beaver wool, made from

a mixture of parchment and coat beaver, and some inferior fur such as rabbit.13
Although domestic hat consumption was not reported, we know that exports
from England of these high-fashion hats almost tripled between 1720 and 1750

and the price of beaver pelts increased.14 The price series, which are based on the
three main types of beaver pelts - parchment, coat, and cub - reveal three episodes

(see table 1).15 The period from 1713 to 1722 was one of stability as prices fluctuated between 5 and 5.5 shillings per pelt; in 1723 prices moved sharply higher
and remained in the 7 to 9 shilling range until 1745; then in 1746 prices rose again
to over 12 shillings and remained at or above this level to 1763. Over the Deriod

11 All fur was classified as either fancy or staple. Fancy furs were those demanded for the beauty
and lustre of their pelt and were fashioned into garments.
12 A combing technique to separate the short hair from the guard hair was developed by the
Russians and became known in England by the last quarter of the seventeenth century.

13 Rabbit or another low-grade fur would be used for the foundation of the hat, and beaver wool
for the nap or surface. The quality of the hat depended on the content of beaver, with the lowestpriced felt hats containing no beaver. They were also least likely to maintain their shape (Lawson
1943, 3-4; Corner 1991).

14 Exports of beaver hats were 206,000 in 1720 and 556,000 in 1750 (Lawson 1943, appendix 1).
15 The prices received by the Hudson's Bay Company can be derived from fur sales to individual

purchasers in Britain as reported in the company's Fur Price Book continuously from 1735 and
erratically in the Grand Journal prior to that date. A problem with the Grand Journal is the

variability in the type of information provided. For some years the Journal reports only the total
revenue received from a particular individual with no information on the number of lots or the
number of skins sold. The Fur Price Book gives price by lot and origin of the pelts. To adjust for
possible quality differences across posts, prices have been weighted by the trade in each type of
pelt to obtain an average price of furs shipped from each trading post. Those furs described as
'damaged' are not included.

a A weighted average of the prices of parchment, coat, and cub beaver. Weights are based on the trade
in these types of furs at Fort Albany (basing the average on York Factory or Fort Churchill gives
similar values). The prices of coat and parchment beaver were generally close, and about double the
price of cub beaver. Prices of the individual types of pelts are not available for the years 1727 to
1735. Prices in the table are averages based on the company's Minute Books. A complete listing of
prices and output weights for the three posts is available from the authors.

1720 to 1750 the five-year average of parchment beaver, which was the dominant
form of pelt, rose from 5.0 to 13.0 shillings, and coat pelts increased from 6.3 to

8.3 shillings.'6
Clearly there was a shift in the European demand for hats, but British legislation
may have contributed to the increase in exports. In 1721 beaver skins and furs were
included under the Navigation Acts as enumerated goods in order to reduce the
16 The relative price of coat to parchment beaver pelts was affected by the technology of felt
making. Both parchment and coat pelts were used in the production of hats, usually in a ratio
of one coat to four or five parchment. In addition, parchment pelts could be used in garments.
Although the relative price of coat fell from 1720 to 1750, its price again exceeded parchment

in the early 1760s. Despite these shifts in relative price, Indians received the same price for coat
and parchment pelts throughout the period. That price was equal to the unit of account used in
exchange, the Made Beaver, which was equivalent to one prime beaver skin.

flow of furs from New York to Amsterdam. This policy increased the supply of

furs to England and also the level of re-exports (Lawson 1943, 11). Then, in a

further attempt to protect England's hatters and felters, Parliament passed the Hat
Act of 1732, which prohibited the export of hats or felt from the colonies. The

Act also limited production of hats in the colonies to masters who had served

apprenticeships of seven years in England (Lawson 1943, 39). The legislation, by

increasing the market share of British hats, raised the demand for beaver pelts in
England. Although the restrictions may have harmed the larger market for pelts,

the price of beaver furs in Europe did increase. An issue addressed in this paper
is how these rising prices played out in terms of what the Indians were paid.
The quantity of trade goods the Indians received at the Bay posts in exchange

for their furs was based on the company's Official Standard, which listed the
prices of trade goods and furs in terms of the company's unit of account, the Made

Beaver (equivalent to one prime beaver skin).17 Comparing the official Made Beaver
prices of trade goods at the posts with the corresponding sterling prices in London

provides a measure of the value of the goods Native groups were receiving for
their furs. For example, in 1742-43 at York Factory, the official cost to the Indians

of purchasing 1 shilling's worth of trade goods averaged 1.42 Made Beaver (see
table 2).18 Alternatively, Native groups received, again at the Official Standard, 0.7
shillings in trade goods for pelts worth 1 Made Beaver. This was also the average
price at Fort Churchill and, at both York Factory and Fort Churchill, the Official
Standard remained roughly constant over time. The official prices were somewhat
more generous at Fort Albany, averaging 0.8 shillings per Made Beaver.

Post factors were permitted, indeed encouraged, to charge Natives more than the

Official Standard for trade goods. For example, at York Factory in 1743 Natives
received, in trade, goods with a total value of 28,337 Made Beaver, based on
the Official Standard; but they gave up furs with a value of 41,013 Made Beaver
(Carlos and Lewis 1998, appendix; Hudson's Bay Company Archives, MG 20B).
The difference between the two amounts was reported in the company accounts as

an Overplus. But offsetting this Overplus were Expenses of 4,017 Made Beaver,
representing gifts paid to the Indians in advance of the actual trading. It is the
relationship between the price Natives received for their furs in terms of trade
goods, based on the company's Overplus and Expenses, and the price of furs in
Europe that we explore in the next two sections.

There was considerable variation by item in the ratio of the Made Beaver price to the sterling
price of trade goods, and guns were somewhat of an outlier at 14 Made Beaver to purchase a
gun that cost 22 shillings in England. More typically, trade goods that cost the Hudson's Bay
Company 1 shilling, were sold to Native Americans at a price of between 1 and 2 Made Beaver.

a Based on returns from York Factory. There was no change in the Official Standard at any of the
trading posts after 1720. Quantities received are drawn from the post's 'General Charge' account,
which reports quantities delivered to the post. The figures differ somewhat from the amounts traded
to Natives because of gifts and carryovers to other years (Carlos and Lewis 1998, appendix). Using
the amounts traded in 1743 gives rise to a different weighting of the shilling and Made Beaver prices,

and would lead to a slightly higher price of furs, 0.74 shillings per Made Beaver rather than 0.70.
Note that the General Charge may have been less sensitive to yearly fluctuations in the trade in
individual items.

Europe by deriving its long-run, profit-maximizing strategy in the presence and

absence of French competition. We begin with a standard harvest function, in
which the number of beaver harvested depends positively on the level of effort and
the biomass. A constant return to effort is assumed, but we allow for diminishing
returns to population:

imation of the true elasticity. Carlos and Lewis (1993, appendix) suggest a harvest function for
beaver based on the nature of the hunt and derive an elasticity of two-thirds under the assumption
of no fixed costs. Introducing fixed costs raises the value of this elasticity.

the price it offered for furs in terms of a variety of trade goods, or possibly through

its decision not to purchase certain furs, such as smaller pelts or pelts of animals
trapped during the summer.20
A key element of the Hudson's Bay Company's pricing decision was the re-

sponse of Native hunters. We describe this response in terms of what is essentially
a supply curve of labour, where labour in this context is Native effort, Et, and the
wage can be interpreted as the return to effort, rt. Expressing the relationship in
constant-elasticity form, we have

Et

=

lr6

(2)

where 5 is the elasticity of supply of effort and 1 is a shift term. Important to the

analysis is our assumption that 8 is positive, which is at variance with much of
the historical literature on how Native Americans responded to higher fur prices.
Nevertheless, the evidence from the trading posts, in our view, strongly supports
an upward-sloping supply curve of Native labour to the fur trade.21
The return to trapping effort can be expressed as the ratio of the value of furs
harvested to the level of effort:

rt

=

ptHtlEt,

(3)

20 The latter method of restricting the harvest was used infrequently and never during periods of
competition with other European traders.

21 According to the historical consensus, Natives' objective was a given quantity of European goods,
and they harvested just enough furs to procure that quantity. Heidenreich and Ray (1976, 48) have
a succinct statement of the generally accepted view: 'The Indians brought only enough furs to
the fort to obtain these [European] goods. By giving him increasingly favourable tenns of trade,
the trader often obtained fewer furs because the Indians could bring fewer pelts to obtain the
same goods.' This view is supported by, and undoubtedly originated from, the writings of contemporaries who saw Natives as indolent, with little concern for other than their imniediate needs.
Joseph Robson's (1752, 29) description of the Indians is typical of European opinion at that time:
'[an] improvident and lazy people, having no concern but the subsistence of the present day.'
There are, however, other statements, many by the same observers, that suggest a different

interpretation of the effect of post prices on Native hunting effort. Nearly all post governors in

their letters home talked of ways of increasing the volume of trade at their posts; and, throughout,
their prescription was either to lower the prices of trade goods or, what is really the equivalent,
improve their quality (Davies 1965). Although French competition was often a concern, the gov-

ernors at Fort Churchill, where there was virtually no French presence, and York Factory, where
the French became a serious commercial threat only after 1738, made similar recommendations.
Indeed Robson, who, as noted above, complained about the laziness of Natives, elsewhere condemned the overplus trade as 'big with inequity.' He continued: 'and [it] is no less inconsistent
with the company's true interest than it is injurious to the natives, who become more and more
alienated from us, and are either discouraged from hunting at all, or inclined to carry all their
furs to the French' (1752, 39; emphasis added).
The qualitative reports are thus at a minimum ambiguous about how pricing policy at Hudson's
Bay affected Native trapping. We do, however, have annual data on both the size of the harvest
and the volume of trade goods sold at the posts. The evidence supports a positive relation between Native effort and the return to that effort. Ray and others have noted that durables did not
fluctuate much from year to year, but there was a dramatic increase in the brandy trade starting in
the 1740s, and there was a substantial trade in such non-durables as beads, shot, and tobacco (Ray
1974; Ray and Freeman 1978). The large increases in brandy sales that accompanied the rising
price of furs is evidence of an elastic demand on the part of Natives for that good. Moreover,
given that many of the trade goods were regarded as luxury items, a positive elasticity of supply
of Native effort seems more plausible than the backward-bending supply curve implied in much
of the literature. This question is explored in greater detail in Carlos and Lewis (1998).

allows us to express the Native harvest in terms of the price of furs, a variable that

the Hudson's Bay Company could control, and the beaver population, Xt:

assumed objective of maximizing the present value of the stream of profits from

where 7r(Xt,pt) is the per-period profit function, F(Xt) is the natural growth of the
biomass, and i is the discount rate. In this optimal control problem, Xt is the state
variable and Pt is the control variable. This dynamic optimization problem cannot

be solved explicitly; rather, we characterize a steady state, and use the approximate
results to derive implications about pricing policy. Omitting time subscripts, a

steady-state solution is given by22

The intuition is staightforward. If 7r were independent of X, i.e., if air/aX = 0, (7)
reduces to F'(X) = i, which is simply the golden rule of capital accumulation. In
this case the optimal biomass would be below the level consistent with a maximum

sustained yield.23 In fact. 3ir/3X > 0: indeed, the entire ratio term in (7) is positive
22 The solution is derived by specifying the Hamiltonian: St = ir(Xt,pt) + A[tF(Xt) - Ht], where At
can be interpreted as the shadow price of the biomass, Xt. The maximum principle requires that

&'H /apt = 0, and dAt/dt = iAt - 1H /aXt. An equilibrium solution occurs where dAt/dt =
0 and dXt/dt = 0. Equation (7) is derived from (4) and these relationships. As Colin Clark
points out, the solution given by these conditions seems to work well for fisheries models of the
type assumed here. But even with the specification we have chosen, other optimal solutions are
possible, including an extinction path and a population that cycles. We have chosen the steady-

state path partly for tractability; but, more important, it seems to reflect more accurately the
long-term pattern of harvesting (Clark 1985, 136-42).
23 We will assume the natural growth function takes the standard quadratic form: F(X) = aX - bX2.

and, if large enough, would give rise to a biomass that does not imply biological
over-harvesting.24

By combining (4), (7), and (8) with explicit profit functions for the cases where

the Hudson's Bay Company had a monopsony and where it competed with the
French, we derive profit-maximizing relationships between the European price of

furs and the price of furs at Hudson's Bay trading posts. In the monopsony case,
the company's profit in each period, rr(Xt,pt), is simply the difference between the
price it receives in Europe for furs and the price it pays to the Indians times the
total harvest:

7r(Xt,pt) = [qt -e -pt(l +re)]Ht, (9)
where qt is the price received by the company for furs, and e, Te are trading
and transport costs.25 By substituting this single-period profit function into the
necessary condition for an optimum, described by (7), we derive a steady-state
profit-maximizing solution:
H

F'(X)

5 q-e I

(10)

1 +86 p(l +Te)

The smallest biomass consistent with long-run profit maximization is again the

solution to F'(X) = i, which for usual discount rates is a biomass slightly below
the biological optimum.26 A major concem of the fur trade literature has been
with depletion, making this an important result. Equation (10) suggests that, where
24 air/aX > 0 because a larger biomass implies a larger harvest and hence greater profits. That
(aH/dp)/(air/ap) > 0 is less obvious, but it follows from the first-order condition on the Hamiltonian (fn22) and the requirement that the biomass have a positive shadow price. Essentially
it says that at the steady-state optimum an increase in the harvest must increase current-period
profits because it reduces future profits.

25 There are various ways of treating the costs of trading. Because the Hudson's Bay Company was
involved in barter, exchanging European commodities for pelts, we distinguish between the transaction cost per pelt, e, and the transaction cost per unit of trade goods. The view we take is that
transactions costs per pelt did not depend on the price of pelts. The transaction costs associated
with trade goods, however, depended on the price, p, that was paid to the Indians for furs, since
the volume of goods traded moved proportionally to that price. An alternative approach would
be to apply all transactions costs to trade goods, taking the view that the high value relative to
weight of furs meant that the volume of trade goods carried was the constraint. The assumptions
made here, while somewhat more cumbersome, lead to more plausible relationships between
the prices of trade goods at the Bay and in England. Note that we could further complicate the
analysis by including a fixed cost. The theoretical analysis would not change, but the empirical
interpretation of some of variables would be affected.

26 The smallest biomass, Xn"', in the monopsony case can be derived directly from the natural
growth functions. Assuming that the function takes the standard quadratic form: F(X) = aX-bX2,

and b = a/X*, where X* is the maximum biomass, it follows that: Xmin/X* = 0.5 - i/2a.
In previous work we have put a = 0.3 (Carlos and Lewis 1993). If the discount rate is 6 per
cent, the minimum biomass would therefore be 0.4X*, which is 20 per cent below the biological
optimum.

the Hudson's Bay Company had a monopsony, the stock of beaver should have
been close to or above the maximum sustained yield level. Also significant is the

implication that high prices of furs in Europe should not have led to high prices at
Hudson's Bay posts with a monopsony in the trade, since it was in the company's
long-run interest at these posts to protect the beaver stocks.

In two of the hinterlands, those served by Fort Albany and by York Factory, the
French were trading during at least part of the period. We allow for this competition

by assuming that a portion of the harvest is taken by the French. Because the
French traders operated largely as independent units, modelling the market as a

duopoly seems inappropriate. Instead, we treat the French as a competitive fringe
and the Hudson's Bay Company as the dominant firm in the trade. According to

this characterization, the Hudson's Bay Company sets a price of furs, which the
French traders take as parametric. Any specification of the French share must be
to some degree ad hoc, but our treatment seems to capture the essential features

of the French trade and is generally consistent with Wien's (1987, 1990) thorough
treatment.27

Unlike the Hudson's Bay Company, which received the Indians at its posts on
Hudson Bay, the French traders had to travel inland along the St Lawrence and

the Great Lakes. Travel costs were a serious impediment to French competition in

the interior. Accordingly, the French share of the trade, st, is treated as a distance
function that depends on the difference between the price of furs in Europe and
the price received by the Indians in the Hudson Bay lowlands:

derive the single-period profit function for the Hudson's Bay Company, which is
assumed to take the share relationship (11) as given:
27 The focus of our paper is the Hudson's Bay Company, whereas Wien examines the French side
of the trade. Although ours is not the only possible interpretation of Wien, his work appears to

support our characterization of the French traders as acting competitively. From 1718 the Compagnie des Indes had a monopoly on the export of furs from New France. They exercised this
right by setting the price of furs paid to the French marchands. At the same time they faced com-

petition from Albany, and as Wien (1990) points out, the price differential was within transport

costs between the Quebec and Albany markets. The Compagnie also issued permits for trade in
the interior, but these were intended to reduce the likelihood of conflict among its own traders.
Despite this limited attempt by the Compagnie to control entry, our characterization of the French

market as perfectly competitive seems reasonable. Note that an altemative approach would be to
recognize that individual French traders, operating at some distance from Hudson Bay, had some

monopoly power. Wien (1990, 299) compares these traders to 'convenience stores.' This view

suggests a form of monopolistic competition among the French. For tractability and because it
would not change the main results, we do not include this refinement.
28 As Wien (1990) documents, there was an approximate relationship between the price paid to

French traders by the Compagnie des Indes and the Paris (or London) price of furs. Parameter c,
which is the slope of the distance function, characterizes the sensitivity of the French share of the
trade to the differential between the European price of furs and the price received by the Indians
at Hudson's Bay posts. We treat transactions costs in the same way we do for the Hudson's Bay
Company, attributing part of the cost to furs and part to trade goods.

7r, = [qt,-e - p,(I + Te)] [l- cptI ], Ht (12)
Substituting this profit function for the Hudson's Bay Company into (7), we derive

the following profit-maximizing solution in the presence of French competition
(time subscripts have been omitted):

(xH [1- 1 +rf q-e -p(1+Tre)_

F'(X) =i- X- leI -+rf q-e-p(l+r) (13)
I + p(1l +-re) I +-re (I + 6)C

If we compare (10) and (13), we see that F'(X) is larger in the competitive
than in the monopsony case, which implies a smaller profit-maximizing biomass.29
The intuition is straightforward. With a French trade that depends positively on
the stock of beavers, the shadow value of the stock to the Hudson's Bay Company

is lower, which leads to more harvesting in the short run and a smaller beaver

population. The second effect is due to the share relationship (11). The Hudson's
Bay Company determines the size of the harvest and hence the beaver population

through the price, p, that it pays the Indians for furs. Any lowering of that price
advances the French trade and reduces the company's share of the total harvest. To
avoid this loss of market share the company pays the Indians a higher price than
in the monopsony case, which leads to a smaller beaver population.

5. The European price of furs and the North American market:
some simulations

According to the models outlined in section (4), the price received by the Indians

and, hence, the size of the beaver population depended on whether or not the
Hudson's Bay Company had a monopsony in the hinterland where the furs were

trapped and traded. These qualitative implications come from inspection of (10)
and (13). Their quantitative importance is suggested by the following simulations
that have been run using plausible parameter values.

The data underlying the simulations are discussed below, but we begin by

illustrating the calculation for Fort Churchill, the post where the Hudson's Bay
Company had a monopsony throughout the period. A necessary condition for optimal pricing in the monopsony case is given by (10), where we assume the natural
growth function, F(X), is the standard quadratic relation used in fisheries models:

720 Ann M. Carlos and Frank D. Lewis

By selecting values for i, a, b, a, 6, 1, e, and We, we solve for the optimal price, p,
paid to the Indians for their furs, corresponding to any price, q, of furs in Europe.30
It should be emphasized that these are steady-state results based on the assumption

that the Hudson's Bay Company took the current price, q, as indicative of future
prices and set the price, p, accordingly. Ours is just one interpretation of how

the Hudson's Bay Company responded to the European fur market and French
competition. Note that the model also generates steady-state values of H and X.
Although we also touch on these results, pricing policy is our concern.

Trading and transport expenses, e and We, are based on comparisons of the price

of furs in England and the cost in England of the trade goods used to purchase
those furs. According to company accounts it appears that, when established, the

Official Standard was considered the break-even point. This Official Standard wa
put in place in 1720, when the price of parchment pelts in England was about 5
shillings. We take this to be the zero-profit price. The implied transactions costs

are then allocated equally between furs and trade goods.31
We derive results for elasticities of supply of effort, 6, of 1 and 2. The more
elastic supply curve gives optimal prices that seems to accord better with the actual

pricing policies at Hudson's Bay posts.32 At Fort Churchill the optimal beaver
prices, derived from the model and the assumed parameter values, show little trend

despite the increase in the price of beaver furs in Europe (see figure 3). The lack of
trend appears consistent with the actual prices Natives were receiving at that post.

Omitting the first few years, we test the relationship formally by running separate
log-linear regressions of the post price on the price in Europe (see table 3).33 The

estimated elasticity of 0.20 using actual post prices compares to an elasticity of 0.25

30 Our approach is to solve the three equations (4), (13), and (15) in the three unknowns: p, H, and
X. Note that F(X) is based on (14). The parameter values used in the Fort Churchill simulations

are i = 0.06, a = 0.3, b = 0.00214, a = 0.5, e = 2, and re = 3. Gregory Clark (1988, 273)
estimates interest rates in England at 4.3 per cent during the period 1701-50 and slightly lower in
the years 1751-1800. Given the risk associated with the fur trade, applying the somewhat higher
discount of 6 per cent to the Hudson's Bay Company seems reasonable. Note that a lower dis-

count rate would lead to a larger steady-state biomass and a lower price to the Indians. The values
of a and b are from Carlos and Lewis (1993). The choice of a is to some to degree arbitrary,

although there is a discussion in Carlos and Lewis (1993, appendix) suggesting that the value
of 1/2 is reasonable. Simulations are based on labour supply elasticities, 6, of 1 and 2. The shift
term, 1, is based on (4), (14), and the price, p, that according to Carlos and Lewis (1993) seemed
consistent with harvesting at the maximum sustained yield. The selected value is based on a price
of 85 (where 100 is the Official Standard), which corresponds to 0.6 shillings per pelt. Trading
and transport costs, e and Te, are discussed in the text.
31 At Fort Churchill, and also at York Factory, the company standard implies a price to the Indians of 0.7 shillings per pelt. Trading costs are therefore put at 4.3 shillings (5 - 0.7). Trading
cost per pelt, e, is assumed roughly half this amount, or 2 shillings, and the cost per shilling of
trade goods, Te, is set at 3 shillings [3 (4.3/2)/0.7]. At Fort Albany, Indian traders received

0.8 shillings per pelt at the Official Standard. There, the corresponding values for e and re are
2 shillings and 2.5 shillings, respectively.

32 Although we focus on simulations where ( is 2, we also discuss the results for ( = 1.
33 For five of the first six years, prices paid to Indians at Fort Churchill were exceptionally high despite low fur prices in Europe. High prices were typical of a post just starting to trade; moreover,
Richard Norton, the post factor, was inexperienced and appears to have overpaid for furs. After
1727, when Norton was replaced, prices fell to normal levels (Carlos and Nicholas 1990, 871).

NOTES: Results are based on equation: In p = a + P1 ln q + p2D ln q, where p is the post price, q is the
European price, and D is a dummy that is 1 if the post is York Factory and the years are 1739 to 1761;

an elasticity based on actual post prices of 0.23, which is significantly lower than

the predicted elasticity.36 During the first ten years of the period, 1713 to 1722,
fur prices were low and the trade was resuming following the Treaty of Utrecht,
marking the end of the War of the Spanish Succession. If we omit these years,
the actual and optimal prices accord more closely. The actual elasticity of 0.29

compares to a predicted elasticity of 0.35.37
The simulation for York Factory is complicated by a change in regime during

the period. The Hudson's Bay Company had a virtual monopsony in the hinterland
until 1738; but with the relocation of Fort Maurepas to the mouth of the Winnipeg
river in 1739 and the subsequent building of additional posts, the French began
diverting trade from York Factory (see figure 1). Consistent with this history, we
base our simulations on (10), which is the monopsony solution, for the period up
36 The difference between the predicted and actual elasticity is even greater for 6 = 1.
37 As predicted by the model, prices at Fort Albany are more sensitive than at Fort Churchill to the
European price. If the regression for Fort Albany is run over the years 1728-63, to be comparable
with Fort Churchill, the estimated elasticity is 0.31. This compares with an elasticity using Fort
Churchill prices of 0.20.

surprising that the simulated price increases sharply in 1739, from 67 to 76, despi
no change in the European price of furs. By comparison, the actual price at York
Factory rose from 68 to 75. Including in our regressions a dummy that allows for

the shift, we estimate the elasticity of the optimal post price with respect to the
European price increasing from 0.30 to 0.36. These values are somewhat above the
elasticities, 0.15 to 0.23, based on actual post prices.

Combining these estimates with the biomass simulation (see figure 2) furthers
our understanding of depletion. In Carlos and Lewis (1993) we argued that French
competition was central to the decline in beaver stocks. That conclusion is consistent

with what we have derived here, but it is just part of the story. In the Fort Albany
hinterland, for example, the beaver population did not become depleted until the
1730s, even though the French had been competing in the region since the late
1600s. Our simulations illustrate that competition was necessary but not sufficient

for depletion to occur. When the price in Europe was low, the price paid by the

Hudson's Bay Company to the Indians, even in the presence of competition, did not

lead to overharvesting. This was the case until the late 1720s, when pelt prices were
generally under 6 shillings. But then buoyant demand in Europe drove up prices
to between 7 and 9 shillings. Given the already pre-existing French presence, the

profit-maximizing response of the company was to raise the price to the Indians
from under 70, a level consistent with the biological optimum, to about 80. In fact,
the price of pelts at Fort Albany, which had been at 70 and below since 1701,

jumped to 80 in 1733 and remained at the higher level until the 1740s, when there
were further increases.

The pattern in the York Factory region was similar in that the price of furs at the

post was raised and the beaver were depleted, but there are intriguing differences.
It was only after the Hudson's Bay Company faced serious competition from the

French in the region that prices paid to the Indians at York Factory were increased.

The price of furs remained below 70 until 1739 despite the earlier rise in Europe,
and in contrast to the experience at Fort Albany, where prices had gone up five
years earlier. The emergence of French competition changed company policy as

the post shifted from the monopsony equilibrium to the competitive one, with its
attendant higher prices and lower beaver stocks. In 1739 prices at the post were

increased to 75 and shortly thereafter to 80 and higher. A decline in the beaver

population was the result, but it began a few years later here than in the Fort Albany
hinterland. Finally, at Fort Churchill, which was insulated by distance from French

competition, prices, and hence the beaver stock, were relatively unchanged despite
the rising price of pelts in Europe.
7. Conclusion

Why and to what extent the Indians depleted the beaver populations have been
the subject of considerable debate. By building on our earlier work on the Hudson
Bay lowlands (Carlos and Lewis 1993), we have examined how the European fur
market influenced the nature of the trade and ultimately the size of beaver stocks.

The Hudson's Bay Company was the major player in the region. Its response to
changes in the price of furs in Britain not only deterrnined the degree of French
competition, it also affected the size of the Indians' fur harvests, where a higher
price to the Indians meant larger harvests in the short run and lower beaver stocks
in the longer term. The company's response to the European market was, therefore,
critical; and in this paper we have applied a resource model to analyse its profit-

maximizing reactions.
Market structure in North America was important. Where the company was a
monopsonist, its optimal strategy in the face of rising European prices was to keep
prices at its trading posts down, which would prevent Indian overharvesting. But
in regions where the Hudson's Bay Company competed with French traders, such
a policy brought with it a cost. The main barrier to the French trade was distance
to the interior; but if the differential between the price of furs in Montreal and the

price at the Hudson's Bay Company posts was large enough, a French trade became
profitable. An increase in the price of furs in Europe that was not offset by higher
prices at the Bay thus advanced French activity at the expense of the Hudson's Bay
Company. The optimal policy of the company was therefore to allow post prices
to rise in order to protect its share of the trade. In 1755, a year for which we have
data on French activities, the French share in the Fort Albany and the York Factory

hinterlands was about 50 per cent and 40 per cent, respectively. These shares are

quite close to the simulated values implied by the company's optimal strategy.39
It is perhaps not surprising that the company records give little indication that
this apparently optimal pricing policy was based on an explicit calculation by the
various post factors. In fact, there is almost no discussion at any of the posts of

depletion. At the same time, the company did take actions that suggest a concem for
the beaver stocks, such as refusing to buy summer beaver and even buming inferior

pelts in front of the Indians. An explicit worry, though, of the Bay factors at York
Factory and Fort Albany was the extent of French competition. They recognized

the importance of matching the French in terms of the price and quality of the

39 In our simulations, based on 6 = 2, the French receive 55 per cent of the furs from the Fort
Albany hinterland and 48 per cent from the York Factory hinterland.

trade goods they were offering in exchange for furs.40 The pricing policies at Fort
Albany and at York Factory after 1738 seem quite in keeping with the Hudson's
Bay Company traders' expressed concern about the French traders.

Central to our story of depletion is evidence that Indians responded with increased harvests when they received a higher price for furs, regardless of the effect
on the beaver population. But why did the Indians not take a longer-run perspec-

tive and control their activities? A variety of factors seem have been at play. Indian
custom regarding the right to hunt for food and other aspects of their 'Good Samaritan' principle mitigated against the emergence of strong trespass laws and property

rights in fur-bearing animals; conflict in the areas around the Hudson Bay hinterland contributed to an environment that was not conducive to secure tenure, and

attitudes towards generosity and even a belief in reincarnation may have played
a role. For these reasons the Indians apparently perceived the beaver as an openaccess resource, and, as a result, high prices led to high harvesting rates. In the
regions served by Fort Albany and York Factory, competition between the French

and the Hudson's Bay Company and a strong fur market in Europe thus combined
to produce the depletion that has been -a major theme of the fur trade literature.
