With all of the horrors of the past year, the devastation wreaked by 
environmental disasters like hurricanes and wildfires have faded from the 
broader cultural consciousness. We ignore these threats at our own peril. As the
climate crisis grows more dire, severe flooding, calamitous storms, and vast 
fires will become an inescapable fact of life, like mosquitoes coming out in 
summertime. Nearly half of all Americans [https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/how
-climate-migration-will-reshape-america-1[1]] will be exposed to some 
environmental hazards over the next thirty years. At their mildest, these events
will disrupt utilities (especially power and water), delay emergency services, 
and interrupt supply chains for several days; at their most severe, they can 
force you from your home, lay waste to the built environment, and render life, 
as you have lived it, unrecognizable. The time to prepare is now; when you feel 
the heat of a wildfire on the back of your neck or hear the first raindrops of 
the oncoming storm, it is too late. 
 
Before Impact: Fortify 
 
Before preparing for an emergency that you cannot prevent, take steps to reduce 
your vulnerability to those you can. Install at least one smoke detector outside
each bedroom in your residence, and test that they are functioning every six 
months. Keep at least one ABC fire extinguisher (approved for solid fuel, liquid
fuel, and electrical fires) on every level of your residence, and consider a K 
extinguisher (for cooking fires) in your kitchen. Check the pressure gauges on 
all extinguishers every year. If you live in an earthquake-prone region, ensure 
that all heavy furniture and electronics are secured.

 If you are fortunate enough to own your own home, harden it against break-ins 
and burglaries. You don’t need to get an expensive camera system that 
collaborates [https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-pol
ice-partnership-social-media-neighbor[3]] with the local police, but you can 
make yourself safer by implementing a few common-sense security measures. 
Upgrading the striker plates in exterior door frames is quick and inexpensive; 
putting bars over windows, less so, and might interfere with a quick evacuation.
If you have the time and resources, 3M window film is a decent compromise. 
Regardless, make sure all windows have functioning locks. If you can, install 
solar-powered motion-activated lights around the exterior of your residence.

Hurricane Maria in 2017 and the 2021 winter storm in Texas put into sharp relief
the weaknesses of the modern power grid, and millions of people found themselves
without heat or power. Until you organize your neighborhood and install a 
community microgrid, you need to make plans to endure extended power-outages. 
Generators are expensive, sometimes loud, and cannot be used indoors, but if you
or someone in your household requires a ventilator or dialysis machine, they are
essential. Generators also can provide a valuable community resource to charge 
phones and run other equipment such as power tools. Inverter generators can be 
very quiet and portable. If you have a gasoline-powered generator, store 
gasoline in metal, self-venting cans, add a sufficient amount of fuel 
stabilizer, and rotate the supplies on a regular schedule—perhaps when you check
your fire extinguishers. Never store gas cans inside your residence. If you do 
not require power for medical devices, an indoor-safe propane-powered space 
heater and a propane stove can provide heat and hot meals without the expense 
and noise of a generator. Whatever you decide, never run any gas-powered device 
in any poorly-ventilated area.

Don’t neglect digital preparedness. One day, we will submit our phones to local 
recycling centers so their lithium can be reclaimed and put to a more 
socially-beneficial use. But until then, we can take steps to make ourselves 
safer and less vulnerable. Encrypt 
[https://riseup.net/en/security/device-security/device-encryption[6]] your data,
learn [https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords[7]] how to create
strong passwords, and familiarize 
[https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/problem-mobile-phones[8]] yourself with the way 
your phone can be used to spy on you, whether by using cell towers or GPS 
information to track the phone’s movements or by infecting the phone with 
malware that can read private data.
 
Once you have reduced your vulnerabilities, make a disaster plan and share it 
with every member of your household. Your plan should be simple and easy to 
remember. The plan should include:
 
  * Threat assessment. Discuss the most likely emergencies, which will differ 
  based on your region. Check FEMA’s Flood Zone Maps 
  [https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-map-zone[9]] if you are unsure if you are at
  risk of flooding. Make sure to take into account unique local hazards that 
  might be affected in the event of a natural disaster, like chemical leakage 
  from a local refining facility.
 
 
  * Rally points. Designate a windowless interior room to be your shelter point 
  for tornadoes and hurricanes, and a location outside your residence to regroup
  if you are forced to evacuate due to a house fire or gas leak. Make sure that 
  there are no obstacles in your halls or doorways that can interfere with a 
  quick escape. If you live on an upper floor, make sure you can access 
  emergency fire escapes. Make sure the evacuation routes are accessible to all 
  members of your household, taking into account mobility restrictions, vision 
  and hearing impairments, and age.
 
 
  * The location of utilities (water, power, and natural gas) and how to shut 
  them off. Natural disasters can damage pipes and wires, leading to water 
  contamination, electrical hazards, or gas leaks (and resulting explosions). 
  You might need a special tool to shut off your water and gas; if this is the 
  case, keep the tool close to the respective shutoff valve by taping or “dummy 
  cording” it to the meter.

[iframe 4 (link #11)]
 
  * Practice. Periodically test the disaster plan with your housemates. Make 
  sure everyone knows where to go, and time how long it takes for everyone to 
  turn off the utilities, grab their gear, and get to the rally point. 
 
 
  * Build the skills that will help in an emergency. If it is offered in your 
  community, get Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
  [https://www.ready.gov/cert[12]] training. Get whatever first aid training you
  can, whether through the Red Cross [https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class[13]]
  or Stop the Bleed [https://www.stopthebleed.org/training[14]]. Join a local 
  American Radio Relay League club. Listen to shows like Live Like the World Is 
  Dying [https://live-like-the-world-is-dying.pinecast.co/[15]], study the 
  Foxfire books [https://www.foxfire.org/[16]], Low- 
  [https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/[17]] and No-Tech Magazine 
  [https://www.notechmagazine.com/[18]], and the Bulletin of Primitive 
  Technology [https://www.btprimitives.com/bpt-publications[19]] to relearn the 
  forgotten techniques that you can use when the power goes out and help is not 
  coming.
 
After making your plan, assemble your kit. Every member of your household should
gather the following supplies:
 
  * Prescription medications and eyeglasses, as well as copies of the 
  prescriptions. If you require hearing aids, you should have extra batteries.
 
 
  * Important documents. Make scans of your Social Security card, passport, 
  birth certificate, driver’s license, concealed carry permit, insurance 
  information, vaccination records, and any other forms or documents that are 
  difficult to replace and necessary for establishing your identity in the 
  aftermath of a disaster. Save the scans in both PDF and PNG (or JPG) to ensure
  they can be read on most platforms, encrypt the files, and store them on a USB
  drive and an SD card. Keep both in a waterproof storage bag. 
 
 
  * A powerful flashlight, headlamp, or both. AAA and AA batteries are 
  ubiquitous, but for extra power, invest in a light that accepts CR123 
  batteries or rechargeable 18650s. Whatever you select, make sure everyone in 
  your household uses the same batteries. SelfBuilt’s reviews 
  [http://flashlightreviews.ca/reviews.htm[20]], posted on the CandlePower 
  forums, are considered the gold standard for anyone looking for flashlight 
  recommendations. Check the charge of your batteries when you check your smoke 
  detectors.
 
 
  * Personal protective equipment, like work gloves, a high-visibility vest, 
  safety glasses, and ear plugs. Natural disasters, especially wildfires, put a 
  great deal of hazardous particles into the atmosphere, so invest in a 
  respirator or pack of N95 masks. Not all masks are created equal; this article
  [https://theprepared.com/gear/reviews/best-gas-mask-respirator-survival/[21]] 
  is a comprehensive resource. Also useful are items to protect against the 
  elements: a rain coat or poncho and some sunscreen.
 
 
  * Water. Get at least one, but ideally two, 32-ounce (or 1-liter) water 
  bottles, like the common Nalgene or a USGI canteen. Keep them full, rotating 
  and cleaning frequently (do not use these bottles for everyday hydration; 
  doing so risks having these bottles on a drying rack or in a gym bag when they
  are most needed). 32-ounce bottles are preferable because most water 
  purification tablets have a dose rate of 1 tablet for 1 quart (see this 
  article [https://iaf-fai.org/2021/01/19/basic-wilderness-fieldcraft/[22]] for 
  an introduction to the various techniques used to make water safe to drink). 
  Steel, single wall 32 ounce bottles will also allow for water purification 
  through boiling. 
 
 
  * A way to stay informed. Get a basic NOAA radio 
  [https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-emergency-weather-radio/[23]]
  that features automatic weather alerts. In the absence of the Internet or 
  cellular networks (which will likely be unavailable during a crisis), this 
  will be sufficient to provide updates and gain information, but a more 
  comprehensive solution would be a handheld radio that can both transmit and 
  receive signals. The Javelina Network has written an excellent resource [https
  ://iaf-fai.org/2020/10/11/skills-for-revolutionary-survival-5-communications-e
  quipment-for-rebels/[24]] for anyone who wants to know more about their 
  options for emergency communication. Also keep a battery pack for your cell 
  phone.
 
 
  * A first-aid kit. Prioritize trauma medicine [http://c-tecc.org/[25]]. Riot 
  Medicine [https://riotmedicine.net/[26]] by Håkan Geijer is a free, 
  comprehensive guide to emergency medicine of all types, and should be 
  considered mandatory reading for all free people. Don’t ignore OTC analgesics 
  (aspirin, paracetemol, naproxen), digestive medicine, and adhesive bandages.
 
Pack the items listed above in a sturdy bag and store it where it is out of the 
way while remaining easily accessible. Place a pair of sturdy, comfortable shoes
next to the bag. It must be noted that sheltering in place is preferable in all 
cases to evacuation. You have more resources in your residence, and your 
supplies are not limited to what you can carry on your back or stuff into the 
trunk of a car. That said, wildfires, hurricanes, and floods have the potential 
to force you from your home, in which case you need to be prepared to slip on 
the shoes, grab your bag, and head out the door. 
 
In addition to the items already listed, the following items should be kept in 
waterproof, portable containers, for use while sheltering in place:
 
  * Food. The most common baseline is a three-day supply of food, but this 
  should be considered the minimum. Build a stockpile of shelf-stable foods by 
  buying one or two cans of soup or jars of peanut butter every time you go 
  shopping. Prioritize foods that require neither water nor heat for 
  preparation: cans of soup, vegetables, and fruit, peanut butter, dried meat, 
  cookies, crackers, etc. Make sure you have a manual can opener; a USGI P-38 
  can opener is painfully slow, but cheap and takes up no space.
 
 
  * Water. Store extra water in food-safe containers. It is recommended to store
  one gallon of water per household member; you should have a minimum of three 
  gallons per household member on hand. Keep away from sunlight and extreme 
  temperatures. Rotate water ever six months. In addition, make sure you have 
  some way to treat water. If you do not have water purification tablets, 
  regular-strength unscented bleach can be used to disinfect water; 2 drops per 
  quart (8 drops, or 1/8 teaspoon, per gallon) will disinfect clear water in 30 
  minutes; a double dose will disinfect cloudy water.
 
 
  * Sanitation supplies. Heavy-duty contractor trash bags, in addition to the 
  bleach mentioned above, can be used to dispose of human waste if water service
  is interrupted. Hand sanitizer, moist towelettes, or camp soap that requires 
  no water can be used to maintain personal hygiene.
 
 
  * Extra flashlights. In addition to each household member’s flashlight, have 
  at least one quality flashlight in an easily accessible location and make sure
  every member of the household knows where it is. Keep a store of extra 
  batteries forthe flashlight.
 
 
  * Some basic tools, both to harden your home in advance of extreme weather, 
  like a hurricane, and to rebuild after the impact. Duct tape has infinite 
  uses, and 4mm nylon “550” or “paracord” has even more, if you take the time to
  learn a handful of useful knots [https://www.itstactical.com/skillcom/knots/5-
  knots-you-need-to-know-how-to-tie-at-all-times/[27]]. There are few tasks that
  cannot be accomplished with a pair of quality tongue-and-groove pliers, a claw
  hammer, and ratcheting driver a good assortment of sockets and bits. A shovel,
  hand saw, and crowbar are useful for clearing debris. Tarps or plastic 
  sheeting are handy for covering up broken windows and holes in roofs.
 
 
  * Comfort items, especially for children. Books, toys, puzzles, decks of 
  cards, and board games can help pass the time and maintain morale.
 
Take special care to accommodate those members of your household with unique 
needs. Ready.gov, FEMA’s collection of emergency preparation resources, is an 
excellent resource for the extra considerations that the elderly 
[https://www.ready.gov/seniors[28]], the disabled 
[https://www.ready.gov/disability[29]], and pets 
[https://www.ready.gov/pets[30]] all require. 
 
Finally, disaster preparedness is a ripe opportunity for planting the seeds of 
community solidarity and mutual aid, which might one day sprout into the kind of
dual power 
[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/wesley-morgan-building-dual-power[31]] 
and interdependence necessary to challenge the supremacy of the State. Get to 
know your neighbors, if you have not already. Share your plans with them, and 
encourage them to make their own preparations. Form the foundation of a network 
of support that can come together after a calamity to share supplies, search for
survivors, and rebuild. The spontaneous “disaster communism 
[https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3461-disaster-communism[32]]” that emerges in 
the wake of crises can be the beginning of a real movement. Mutual Aid Disaster 
Relief [https://mutualaiddisasterrelief.org/[33]] is a priceless resource for 
anyone seeking more information on how to form networks and what you can do to 
help.
 
After Impact: Rebirth
 
Preparedness is not, contrary to popularly invoked images, the province of the 
tin-foil-hatted survivalist. It is a rational, and in fact, the only rational, 
response to a precarious world. Between Hurricanes Katrina, Harvey, and Maria, 
the Camp and Paradise fires, and once-unthinkable catastrophes like the Iowa 
derecho, there have never been more reasons to take action to ensure that you 
will be safe after a disaster. That said, preparedness without purpose serves 
only to perpetuate the individualism that infects modern society. Make a plan so
that you may not only survive, but thrive, in so thriving, bring forth a new 
world [https://hurricaneparty0.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/storming-the-breach.p
df[34]], as the Wobblies said, from the shell of the old.
