We examine bargaining between the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay
Company using recent models of bargaining under incomplete information. Two
previously undisturbed bodies of correspondence are analyzed: letters between

the two companies and letters between the Hudson's Bay Company and its
London committee. Through merger the companies achieved a joint maximum,

but the lengthy and costly bargaining process dissipated much of the potential gain
through depletion of animal stocks. Achievement of a joint maximum was
hindered by incomplete information, commitment to a strategy which led to
bargaining breakdowns, delineation of each party's rights under law, and environmental changes.

The early development of British North America is the history of
exploitation of the natural resource base. One such early activity
was the fur trade. Its impact on the development of the Canadian
economy was related, in turn, to organization of the markets and to
ownership of property rights in the resource. A rich body of literature on
the fur trade focuses on the trade's development and the roles played by

the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company.' But, the

literature has been largely descriptive rather than analytical.' While a

great deal is known about the historical facts surrounding the development of the fur trade little is known about the reasons behind those
observed facts.
An important period for the development of the industry was the
years from 1804 to 1821. During this seventeen-year period the
Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company were a duopoly

unhindered by antitrust legislation. Not only were these two companies
operating in the same geographic market area and the sole buyers of furs
on the North American market, they were also the most important

sellers of furs on the British market. With such a market organization,
traditional cooperative game theory suggests that these firms should

have arrived at an agreement to conserve the resource rents. Rather, the
period is characterized by intense conflict and ended with dissipation of
the resource.
We examine why the two companies took seventeen years to arrive at

a profit-maximizing agreement and focus on the various attempts made
by both parties to arrive at such an agreement. An examination of the
bargaining during this period provides insight into the historical development of the North American fur trade and empirical evidence on the
problems encountered in bargaining under incomplete information. The
bargaining process between the two companies is examined by an

analysis of two rich and previously undisturbed bodies of correspondence. One is between the Hudson's Bay Company and its London
management committee, and the other is between the committee and
the Northwest Company. These documents show the process of negotiation and the reasons why the companies failed to reach an agreement
before 1821.
I. A MODEL OF TWO-PARTY BARGAINING WITH INCOMPLETE
INFORMATION AND COMMITMENT APPLIED TO THE FUR TRADE

While more traditional cooperative game-theory literature would
suggest rapid agreement to conserve rents, recent literature on bargaining under incomplete information suggests a model which better captures the historical bargaining process considered here. Following
Roger Myerson and Vince Crawford, each company can make some

amount of profit by itself, without cooperating with the other firm.3 We
refer to these profits as the profits at the conflict outcome or disagreement outcome. But, in a world of imperfect information, neither firm
they do not use the primary source material. Second, they do not consider models of bargaining
under incomplete information.

knows the other firm's profits at the conflict outcome or whether the

other firm is a tough or a soft bargainer. In such a world, Myerson
suggests that each firm wants to reveal as little as possible about itself
and may even misrepresent itself in hopes of bargaining for a larger
share of whatever joint profits are available. In particular, each firm
would like the other firm to believe that its individual profits would be

high at the conflict outcome and that it is likely to be a tough bargainer.
Since each side is reluctant to reveal very much about itself and may

even misrepresent itself, neither side can trust the information it gets
from the other side. Thus, since the information on the profits at the
conflict outcome which emerges as the aggregation of each firm's
alleged profits is likely to be misleading, each firm knows that it cannot
accept any agreement that specifies a specific amount of profit going to

each firm. This implies that the firms are more likely to bargain over a
mechanism for distributing whatever profits they can amass if they can
cooperate than over some specific number that might turn out to be
unobtainable.

One possible efficient mechanism is what Myerson refers to as a
'random dictatorship." In other words, in each period during which the
parties cooperate, one of them is chosen to be dictator by some random
process. Presumably, during that period, the dictator will maximize

joint profits and retain a large proportion of the profits for itself. If the
random process gives each firm an equal probability of being dictator,

then joint profits will always be maximized and each firm will get about
one-half of the profits, on average. While it is perhaps stretching the
point to say that the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest
Company ever contemplated a random dictatorship, they did spend a
great deal of time trying to reach a merger agreement and bargaining
over which side would make the decisions for the monopoly which
would result. Moreover, when they failed to reach a merger agreement
early on they turned their attention to other mechanisms for distributing
whatever joint profits they might earn. In particular, they bargained
over a distribution of territory that each would then exploit as a
monopolist.

While a merger or a dictatorship of some kind would be efficient, in
the process of misinforming one another bargainers could choose a
mechanism assigning positive probability to some "bad" outcomes for
both parties once the true information about conflict profit levels and
bargaining strength is revealed. While this did not exactly happen to the

Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company, since they did
eventually agree on a merger, they did fail to agree (bargaining breakdown) numerous times. Each time bargainers fail to agree they get only
the conflict or disagreement profits, which are, presumably, significantly less than what they could earn at the cooperative outcome.
Another problem when firms deliberately mislead one another is that

each side may threaten the other by verbally committing itself to a
position which is untenable in light of the demands from the other side.
Having made such a verbal commitment, it is difficult to back down
without losing face. Crawford argues that it is rational for a bargainer to
commit himself to an advantageous position, because, if the opponent
becomes convinced of his stance, the payoff is potentially high. But,
once the bargainers commit themselves to strategies, they may leave no
room for agreement.
There is little doubt that the Hudson's Bay Company and the
Northwest Company recognized the benefits from cooperation; yet, the
bargaining process was long and costly. The key elements of the model
of bargaining under incomplete information are inferred from the
correspondence we examined. First, each side seemed to be trying to
mislead the other about its initial position. The Hudson's Bay Company
may even have been trying to covertly improve its relative initial

position during the negotiation. Second, there is almost no mention of
specific profits to be divided. Instead, the companies seemed to be
searching for a mutually agreeable mechanism: first merger, then
territorial division, then drive the other firm out of business, and finally
merger once again. Third, by 1810 the Hudson's Bay Company had
committed itself to a particular strategy and had linked that stance to the

"rights and honour" of the company. It is clear that if the Northwest
Company had accepted the Hudson's Bay Company's position, the

payoff to the Hudson's Bay Company would have been very large. But,
the strategy did not work. The Northwest Company refused to be
threatened and bargaining kept breaking down.
II. BACKGROUND MATERIAL FOR THE DUOPOLY PERIOD

By 1804 the British North American (Canadian) fur trade was
controlled by two companies, the Northwest Company and the
Hudson's Bay Company. The Northwest Company was a joint-stock

partnership, in which each partner was fully liable for the debts of the
company. There were two different types of partners: the Montreal
merchants, who furnished capital for the enterprise, and "Wintering

partners," who went out to trade with the Indians. Wintering partners

had no obligation to provide capital or credit to the company; their role
was to organize the trade with the Indians.4 Because Wintering partners
were shareholders, they had an interest in the profitable operation of the

company and, in effect, were on profit-sharing rather than wage

contracts. Thus, they would have been concerned if the profitability of
the company was endangered.

The Hudson's Bay Company, whose headquarters were in London,

'The Northwest Company trade in the interior was divided into districts known as departments
Over each department there was a Wintering partner.

was a joint-stock, limited liability company, established by Royal
Charter in 1670. Control and decision-making authority lay with the
governor and the committee in London, and they allowed their officers
in Canada very little latitude. The charter gave the company rights to all
the land within the Bay's drainage basin, an area that extends as far west
as the Rocky Mountains. However, the charter did not create an
exclusive right to trade in that area. The English Parliament ratified the
charter in 1690, for a period of seven years, but never re-ratified it.
A central theme of all the negotiations was the charter. So important
was the charter that when negotiations opened in 1804, both sides
sought legal advice about its validity. Counsel for both sides gave the
opinion that the Crown could grant land but not exclusive trading rights.
Only Parliament could grant trading rights. Thus, the use of the charter
during the negotiations revolved around the grant of land. With exclusive rights to land in the charter area, it was possible for the charter
holder to deny rival firms the right to build supply and trading posts.
Without posts, it was impossible, over those distances in the early
nineteenth century, to keep traders supplied. The object of negotiation,
then, was to find a mechanism which allowed both to benefit from the
charter and which could keep potential rivals out of the trade.
The use of the charter as a barrier to entry had been noted in the
Journals of the Voyages of Alexander Mackenzie, published in 1801.5
Mackenzie, an explorer and Northwest Company partner, argued that
the fur trade could be carried out most profitably by a single company.
He proposed "the junction of such a commercial association [Northwest Company] with the Hudson's Bay Company." The new company
would carry out the trade "under the priviledge of their [Hudson's Bay
Company] charter." If negotiation on merger should fail, MacKenzie
suggested that the least the Hudson's Bay Company could do for the
Montreal traders as British citizens was to grant them a right of passage
from Hudson Bay inland "for the sole purpose of transport, under the
most severe and binding restrictions not to interfere with their trade on

the coast."6
III. 1804 TO 1810

In 1804 the Northwest Company requested right of transit through
York factory on Hudson Bay to Lake Winnipeg. Its request created an

opening to establish purposeful bargaining 'with the Hudson's Bay
Company. The Northwest Company offered to withdraw from all other
posts in the vicinity of Hudson Bay. The Hudson's Bay Company
realized "that it would be advantageous for all concerned in the fur
trade if some regulation could be made with the Canadian company or

companies."7 But, it wanted more than the abandonment of already
unprofitable posts. In particular, it wanted compensation for the present

and future loss of trade that right of transit implied. Thus, the door for
serious discussion between the two parties was opened.

The theoretical framework discussed previously suggests some characteristics of these discussions. In particular, although the first round of
negotiations seems like a simple merger-directed bargaining session, the
two companies do not mention profit-sharing arrangements outside of a
strict merger. The Hudson's Bay Company, in particular, will only
discuss mechanisms which give control over the profits from the
venture to itself. The Northwest Company can buy the Hudson's Bay
Company outright, thus guaranteeing the purchase price to the
Hudson's Bay Company shareholders, or the two companies can merge
under the directorship of the Hudson's Bay Company committee in
London.

Also, the charter is only invoked in regard to the sale of transit rights
to the Northwest Company. Knowing the Hudson's Bay Company

cannot deny it the right to trade furs, the Northwest Company requests
the right to build a legally guaranteed post in the charter area. In return,
it agrees to withdraw from other posts in the charter area which it
occupied illegally (in the context of the charter). Failing to agree, both
sides return to the status quo, or conflict outcome, which includes some
amount of trespass by the Northwest Company on the Hudson's Bay
Company charter land.

Although both firms recognized the gains from cooperation, they

failed to reach agreement on the first round. The first-round failure
illustrates some of the inherent bargaining problems. In particular, the

Northwest Company was so recently formed that the Hudson's Bay
Company did not know what to expect from its new rival. The
committee was also concerned with security of tenure and the ability of
the Northwest Company to enforce agreement on all potential traders
out of Montreal.8

When the two sides communicated again in May 1805, the Northwest

Company explained that it did not want to challenge the Hudson's Bay
Company trade or the validity of the charter. Rather, it simply wanted
to exclude potential rivals.9 At the same time, however, James Forsyth,
the London agent for the Northwest Company, explained that the

8 The Northwest Company had been formed by the merger of Alexander Mackenzie's company
and the old Northwest Company. The rivalry leading up to this merger was particularly intense and

bitter. The Hudson's Bay Company letters at this time speak of "Canadian traders who respect
neither justice nor equity but commit open acts of violence...." Hudson's Bay Company

company was not in favor of a partition of districts. In its reply, the
Hudson's Bay Company asked if the Northwest Company wanted to
buy it out. Although this proposal would have given the Northwest
Company what it wanted, the negotiators could not accept it because all
available capital had been used to create the new Northwest Company.
The Hudson's Bay Company then proposed the second option, a
"junction of interests," with the charter to protect the new company.
Although this became the ultimate solution, the Northwest Company
refused it at that time because the center of control would have moved
from Montreal/Fort William to London. Given the recent struggle to
create the Northwest Company, itself, the negotiators realized that the
Wintering partners would never agree.
After these proposals were rejected, the Hudson's Bay Company
committee made an all-or-nothing offer, asking the Northwest Company
negotiators either to buy out the Hudson's Bay Company or to make a
special offer. Forsyth offered 2,000 pounds sterling annually for seven
years, to withdraw from James Bay, and to build no posts other than
York any closer to the sea than their present posts. In addition, it
"offered to give Bonded security of two sufficient mercantile houses for

the due performance of all their engagements."'10
The Hudson's Bay Company committee again showed its uncertainty
about its competitors by requesting "collateral security that will ensure
to us those advantages which it is your intention to offer in compensation for those facilities in prosecuting your trade" and by reminding the
Northwest Company negotiators that, "you must be aware that we are
of course restrained to carry on our trade exclusively with Great Britain,
it will therefore be a necessary consequence of our treaty that you
should confine yourself to the same restrictions."11
The Northwest Company "offered to give a Bonded Security" for its
conduct, but "would not submit to any restriction or limitation to carry
on their trade with Hudson Bay to and from Great Britain exclu-

sively. "12 For its part, the Hudson's Bay Company committee felt that
if the Northwest Company was not willing to meet its requirements, the
Hudson's Bay Company "should not feel justified in acceding to the

terms proposed.'"13 In February of 1806 the negotiations ended.
The failure of the Hudson's Bay Company to push harder for the
charter boundary at this time (by threatening to bring a trespass suit, for
instance) suggests that the gains from trying to assert that property right
were perceived as being small (or even negative) as compared with

accepting the profits at the conflict outcome. Perhaps the Hudson's Bay

Company already feared a Northwest Company countersuit charging
that the Hudson's Bay Company had never settled its charter land. In
any event, the Hudson's Bay Company letters during the period suggest
satisfaction with the status quo, given that they could not get a merger
by peaceful negotiation. Over the next seventeen years, however,
changes in the output market and depletion of animal stocks combined
to dramatically change the Hudson's Bay Company's perception of the
potential value of its charter.
Although the two companies were unable to reach a formal contractual agreement in the 1804/06 negotiations, they continued to cooperate
informally from 1804 to 1810.14 This informal cooperation seemed to
generate enough joint profits to make the "conflict" outcome preferable
to any formal agreements yet proposed. The letters show that both
companies wanted to preserve informal cooperation. The Hudson's Bay

Company continually wrote to its officers, telling them to "maintain the
utmost peace and harmony with your opponents" and "to avoid any
discussion or disagreement with those people."15 Alexander Henry, a
Northwest Company partner, wrote at length in his journal of the good

relations that existed between the men of both companies. 16 In general,
all the evidence suggests the two companies were learning about each
another's relative strengths and market shares and learning to trust one

another. Formal negotiations were not reopened but, at the same time,
each firm went out of its way not to threaten the other firm.

Despite the lack of formal negotiations, however, Alexander
MacKenzie continued to try to gain access to Hudson Bay for the

Northwest Company, either through a grant of privileges from the
government or through the purchase of shares in the Hudson's Bay

Company. To buy shares, however, MacKenzie needed an individual
trusted by the Hudson's Bay Company to buy shares for him. Thomas
Douglas, the 5th Earl of Selkirk agreed, but it soon became clear that
MacKenzie and Lord Selkirk were playing very different games.

MacKenzie wanted to gain enough votes on the Hudson's Bay Com-

pany committee to guarantee the Northwest Company a right of passage
for its western trade. Selkirk, on the other hand, wanted the Hudson's

Bay Company to grant him land for colonization. 17
Negotiations were complicated further by events in Europe. In 1808
the Napoleonic Blockade cut the demand for furs on the English market

by at least 50 percent of the 1800 level.'8 Not only was overall demand
cut in half, the effect fell more heavily on the Hudson's Bay Company.
There were two reasons why that company suffered more. First, its
charter required that it abide by the Navigation Acts and sell on the
English market only. Thus, it could not try to develop new markets. The
Northwest Company, on the other hand, turned more to the American
market. Second, the Hudson's Bay Company was so centralized in
London that it was impossible to make short-term adjustments in the
prices it paid the Indians. The Northwest Company responded to the
new demand conditions by changing its relative prices. Thus, it was able
to obtain the more valuable furs, leaving the Hudson's Bay Company to
purchase (at its prescribed prices) only those furs whose market demand
had decreased.19 As a result, the Hudson's Bay Company's profits
declined dramatically.
In fact, by 1809/10 the Hudson's Bay Company was faced with a very
severe financial crisis, the severity of which is suggested in Table 1. As
the table shows, the surplus from cooperation must have fallen precipitously. Where before it had looked as though they were playing a
nonzero-sum game with large benefits from cooperation, it must have
started to look like a zero-sum game after 1808.20
The company went from making healthy profits to amassing large
losses between 1807 and 1808. In response, the Hudson's Bay Company
committee decided to pursue the fur trade more aggressively, by making
full use of its charter rights and by moving into territory previously
worked only by the Northwest Company. The Hudson's Bay Company
particularly wanted to move into the Northwest Company's prime
beaver area around Lake Athabasca, because by 1810 its traditional
trading areas were becoming depleted. The Hudson's Bay Company
also began to discuss taking the Northwest Company to court for
trespassing on charter lands.
As a result of the change in the environment and the new strategy of
the Hudson's Bay Company committee, the bargaining process became
more bitter and protracted the next time. The surplus had become
smaller and the relative initial positions of the two firms had substan-

tially changed. Now, neither firm trusted that it could guarantee itself

better profits from cooperation. Each side feared the other was gaining
at its expense. What really happened was the total joint profits had fallen
'8A full discusion of the effect of this fall in demand can be found in Carlos, "Causes and
Origins."

I sent them to my neighbors [Hudson's Bay Company] as wolves were not in season," i.e., not in
demand, p. 558.

20 In a zero-sum game there are no benefits from cooperation. Anything one firm wins is at the
expense of the other firm.

because of the blockade and because competition had depleted the
animal stocks.
As the next round of formal negotiations began in 1811 the focus of

bargaining changed since 1804/06. Previously the issues were the right

of transit from Hudson Bay for the Northwest Company and a possible
merger of the two companies or a buyout of the Hudson's Bay
Company. In 1810, on the other hand, the focus was entirely on
establishing clear geographical areas within which each company would
be able to maintain a fur-trading monopoly. Having failed to merge in
the previous round of negotiations, they now bargained over a mechanism which would maintain the integrity of the two companies.

IV. THE NEGOTIATIONS OF 1810 TO 1811

The next round of negotiations formally opened on June 3, 1811.
When one examines the offers and counteroffers made in this round, it
is evident that each company was trying to mislead the other about its

initial position, its true demands, and its true bargaining posture. The

Hudson's Bay Company tried to convince the Northwest Company that

unless it retained its charter it could not enter into an agreement. By
invoking the charter, the company claimed to be in a strong legal and
financial position vis-d-vis the Northwest Company, despite the fact
that the company's profits were much lower than they had been during
the previous negotiation. Although the offer did include sole Northwest
Company control of the Athabasca, this was not as magnanimous as it
sounded. The Hudson's Bay Company had previously been unsuccessful in setting up posts there.
The Northwest Company, for its part, pretended to be indifferent to
an agreement. It wanted the Hudson's Bay Company to believe that it
was offering to cede valuable territories and maintain marginally valu-

able ones. The Northwest Company even tried to claim it might actually

be hurt by the magnanimous division it had proposed. In reality,
however, the proposal guarded the Northwest Company's most profitable areas and conceded currently unprofitable ones.
Another characteristic of this round of negotiations is that the two

companies continued to bargain only over a mechanism for distributing
profits, not over a specific division of the profits. In 1804/06 they had

tried to agree on a merger or buyout, but failed. This time they tried to
divide the territory into separate monopolies. This could also have been
an efficient mechanism if they could simultaneously have resolved the
issue of transit rights. As it was, however, they again ended up with the

conflict outcome. By misleading one another they could not find out
how much joint profit they were dividing and how each proposed

division would distribute those profits. The breakdown in bargaining
also occurred because the Hudson's Bay Company committed itself to
a particular stance before the negotiations opened and linked that stance
to the reputation of the company.

Turning now to a more detailed analysis of the bargaining process, the
Northwest Company letters to the Hudson's Bay Company committee

offered a set of boundaries that would last for twelve years. Their
proposed division meant that the Hudson's Bay Company would have
the whole of the Assiniboine region and the south and west side of the

Saskatchewan from Cumberland House to the Rockies, "beyond which

they are not to go.' '21 In return, the Northwest Company requested the
Athabasca, the Upper Churchill and the Beaver River districts, all the
land north and west of the Saskatchewan, and some parts of the Nipigon
region. The Northwest Company's arguments centered on a desire "to

curtail expense in the competition of a trade for which the circum-

stances of the times are particularly unpropitious. "22 The company
hoped that these boundaries would be beneficial to both parties. The

Hudson's Bay Company could now obtain greater returns by working
its own departments and would not have to waste resources on
unsuccessful forays into the remote Northwest Company regions. The
Northwest Company would also gain, "provided the basis of a treaty
can be founded on the exclusion of the Hudson's Bay Company traders
from the Athabasca posts discovered and established at so much
expense by the Northwest Company.' '23
The Hudson's Bay Company's reply began by dismissing the Northwest Company proposal as "a scheme so inadmissible that to entertain
it would imply a disregard both of the interest and Honour of the Body
we represent.' '24 Thus, from the very beginning of this round of
bargaining, the Hudson's Bay Company committee was staking the
honor of the company on maintaining its position. Despite taking such
a strong stand, however, the tone was still conciliatory and the letter
ended up with the statement that: "if this difficulty can be removed, we
shall be ready to treat if an arrangement on fair principles and on such
terms as may evidently be for the mutual advantage of both companies. "25 Thus, while honor was put foremost, the heart of the negotiation revolved around the meaning of "an arrangement of fair principles."
To the Northwest Company a fair arrangement was one which left it
Athabasca and which took into consideration the actual possessions of
the Northwest Company and the lands it had opened. The Hudson's
Bay Company's definition of a fair arrangement was one which guaranteed its charter limits, in return for which the company would not go
over the height of land to the Saint Lawrence at Fort William, to
Athabasca at Methye Portage, or to the Columbia at the southern end of

the Continental Divide. But, the committee would not promise to stay
out of the unexplored areas west of the Rockies. The Hudson's Bay

Company promised, however, to make "every reasonable accommodation in respect to posts of deposit and provisions will be readily
accorded to on our part."26
The response by the Northwest Company was unenthusiastic. Northwest Company agents in London pointed out that they were being asked
to give up half the land currently operated by the company without
indemnity. Such a move "would lead to the sacrifice of the best interests

of our constituents."27 Thus, while they were "unwilling to say anything which might] shut the door to further negotiations" no division
based on the charter limits was possible.28 Thus, both companies

arrived at the conflict outcome once again. This time, however, they did
not continue to coexist peacefully. Instead, a major, long-lasting change
in the fur-trading environment began.
V. COMPETITION: 1812 TO 1815

While the Napoleonic Blockade precipitated the change in the
Hudson's Bay Company's strategy and the beginning of competition, it
did not last very long. Had that been the only crisis, the benefits from

cooperation would have been evident soon again. Unfortunately depletion of animal stocks became an increasingly serious problem after

1810.29 Table 2 shows the quantity of beaver exported from Hudson Bay
from 1800 on. Between 1810 and 1816 the quantity available for export
fell significantly relative to the years prior to 1810. The temporary

increase after 1816 illustrates the Hudson's Bay Company's move into
the Athabasca region. The problem of depletion can also be seen in the

composition of the furs exported. As Table 2 demonstrates, muskrat
became far more important. Unfortunately, however, increasing depen29 See Carlos, "Birth and Death," for a discussion of the animal stock depletion.

dence on muskrat brought increasing dependence on the cyclical nature
of the environment since muskrat populations follow cyclical climatic
variations 30

The financial crisis had already forced the Hudson's Bay Company to
undergo a complete restructuring not just of its trading methods, but,
more importantly for this discussion, of its view of the company's role
in the fur trade. The aim was to increase the company's market share
and to force the Northwest Company to accept a change in market-share
distribution. The plan made clear that the company should change from
informal cooperation to aggressive competition.
The committee's commitment to its charter can also be seen in the
steps taken in late 1811. A condition of the original charter had been the
settlement of land, a condition so far unfulfilled. In 1811 the Hudson's
Bay Company sold Lord Selkirk the land in the Red River area he had
wanted for colonization. This tract, known as the Selkirk Settlement or
the Red River Settlement, lay at the heart of the Northwest Company
provisioning area around the bottom of Lake Winnipeg. The Hudson's
Bay Company also began actively spying on the Northwest Company as
part of its campaign to maintain the rights of its charter. All the chief
factors were told to report on the activities of the Northwest Company,
which would allow the Hudson's Bay Company to prosecute acts of
trespass. Meanwhile, the Hudson's Bay Company began preparation
for establishing posts in the Northwest Company monopoly areas, the
Rocky Mountains and the Athabasca. In 1814, the committee wrote to
the governor of the Northern Department, "[T]he country across the
mountains we should imagine to be already occupied by the Northwest

Company and therefore you should be prepared for an opposition.''31
Although depletion was not as serious a problem for the Northwest

Company, it was still a concern, and any monopoly lands became that
much more valuable. The Northwest Company's financial position was
further affected by the War of 1812, some of which was fought in its
territory. Moreover, the Selkirk settlement compounded the effect of
the war, since the Northwest Company could no longer provision itself
fully from that district. This, in turn, made it seem to the Northwest

Company that the Selkirk settlement was a deliberate attack.
By 1814, the Northwest Company began to express concern over the

direct threat from the Hudson's Bay Company's new policy. In that
year the Northwest Company partners decreed that "no Hudson Bay

servants should in future be received into any of the company's posts in
case of starvation, and on no account [are any] to be engaged in the

Northwest Company. "32 This was a very strong stand, especially when
starvation was an ever-present threat to the existence of both trader and
Indian.

Finally, in late 1815 the Hudson's Bay Company moved into the
Athabasca region, even though in both the previous negotiations (1804
and 1810) the area had been conceded as a monopoly region by the
Hudson's Bay Company. This provocation initiated a series of countermoves and a period of active, often hostile, competition.
VI. 1815 TO 1821

Before the worst began, however, the two companies attempted,
unsuccessfully, to negotiate once again, beginning in December of 1815.

The Hudson's Bay Company adopted a "tough" bargaining stance from
the outset. In particular, the company maintained its commitment to the

charter, believing it could not afford to do otherwise. The company
pursued that strategy even though it had already led to a bargaining
breakdown. In fact, it might be argued that the company was not
seriously negotiating but simply testing to see if the Northwest Company would concede an increased market share. Also, the Hudson's
Bay Company appointed Lord Selkirk as its chief negotiator. That
choice could not have helped the bargaining process. He was new to the
scene, was negotiating on the basis of written instructions from En-

gland, and disliked the Northwest Company because of its supposed
involvement in what was known as the Seven Oaks Massacre at the Red
River Settlement. The Northwest Company disliked him because of the
Red River Settlement itself.
In August 1815, the Hudson's Bay Company wrote Lord Selkirk

telling him the company was "fully convinced of the importance of
some arrangement between the Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest Company. . . ." and that he should try to reach a new agreement,
without budging on the issue of the charter.33 In particular, he was told
that, in "any compromise with the Northwest Company the main object
to be attended to is the preservation of the chartered rights of the
Hudson's Bay Company, avoiding any concession which can fairly be

construed into a dereliction of our privileges.""n Selkirk was also to try
to get an acknowledgment of those "rights to the property and jurisdiction of all the country lying upon the waters that run into Hudson
Bay. "35
In return, the committee empowered Selkirk to repeat the offer of

1811. The Hudson's Bay Company would give up claim to the

Athabasca and not go over the height of the land to the south.36 It would
provide provisioning posts in the lands given up by the Northwest
Company, and it would give the Northwest Company right of transit
from Lake Winnipeg to Port Nelson on Hudson Bay.37 This latter offer
could be considered a conciliatory gesture on the part of the Hudson's
Bay Company. The right of transit was not offered in 1810, and it thus
represents a major change in position between 1810 and 1815.
When the two sides met in Montreal, Selkirk told John Richardson,
the Northwest Company agent, that the Hudson's Bay Company was
willing to enter into an agreement consistent with its "rights and
honour." It is not clear whether Selkirk actually ever mentioned the
offer of a right of transit through Hudson Bay. The Northwest Company
made two counteroffers. The first was a division of the territories
acceptable to itself. The second was a merger of the trade for eight
years, with the profits (or losses) being split two-thirds to the Northwest

Company and one-third to the Hudson's Bay Company. Each company
would sell half the skins, and the skins would be shipped from either

Montreal or Hudson Bay, whichever was cheaper. The division reflected the relative initial sizes of the two companies but did not
recognize the expansion of the Hudson's Bay Company as a result of its
more aggressive pursuit of the trade. Selkirk replied that the committee
still adhered to the same principles as in 1811 and in fact as "the
circumstances of the Hudson's Bay Company being materially im-

proved since 1811, they might rather be expected to raise than lower
their demands.' 38
In spite of Selkirk's rejection of both offers, the Northwest Company
continued to push for a merger. First, they proposed that the Northwest

Company would manage the interior and would send a representative to
the bay to supervise activities there. Everything was to be inventoried,
and all posts and buildings would return to the firm which built them at
the end of the partnership. Second, the agreement would constitute
neither an admission by the Hudson's Bay Company that its charter was
inviolate nor an admission by the Northwest Company that is was valid.
The Northwest Company argued that it should manage the trade to
ensure unity of management. If there were two managements there

would be "useless waste of expenditure, and risk of property, to which

opposition necessarily gives rise."39 The Hudson's Bay Company
would appoint one man to work with the Northwest Company agents,

36In spite of the fact that the Hudson's Bay Company was negotiating with the Northwest
Company to leave Athabasca under Northwest Company control, the Hudson's Bay Company had
already sent an outfit to Athabasca.

and there would be no distinction between departments (for example,
Athabasca) for the duration of the partnership (that is, all profits would

simply be divided regardless of origin).
Selkirk replied on 23 December that he could only deal with a division
based on the limits of the charter and could not originate any plan for
union. In so replying, he showed once again his commitment to the
charter limits. He wrote that he "ha[d] no doubts that very superior

profits might be derived from the whole trade being under one undivided
management."40 But, he was still of the opinion that there were inherent
and unsurmountable difficulties. One of these was the "radical difference in the constitution of the two companies.... It would be a waste
of time to enter into a consideration of its details.' 41 He proposed an
arrangement of boundaries as "the best chance of reconciling the
interests of the companies. "42 In addition, given that, the "opposition. . . has had the effect of exhausting the country," Selkirk argued
that the Northwest Company should be happy that the Hudson's Bay

Company only asked for the same boundaries as in 1811, seeing that the

Hudson's Bay Company was better off than in 1811.43 The Northwest
Company rejected Selkirk's offer once again.
Thus, negotiations broke down again. This time, however, both sides
proceeded to adopt policies designed to force the other to concede.
Each now tried aggressively to capture trade from the other and to
disrupt whatever trade the other continued to control.44 The following
letter makes it clear that the Hudson's Bay Company had decided that
aggressive competition was necessary. The committee wrote: "We
consider it to be of the most essential importance to the permanent
interest of the company that the opposition to the Northwest Company

in the Athabasca should be vigorously pursued."45 The effect this
period of competition had on the Northwest Company's profits is not
known precisely. But, Table 1 shows that the Hudson's Bay Company
was severely hurt. The cost of the campaign extended the Hudson's Bay

Company to its overdraft limit, and its trading losses must have been
enormous.46

It is likely that the Northwest Company was also badly hurt, since the

44 At this point the threats and counterthreats became directly physical. The use of such tactics
as bully boys, trading each others' debts, and the kidnapping business is discussed at length in
Carlos, "Birth and Death."

partners reopened negotiations in 1820, citing the bad financial situation
and growing violence of the trade.47 The Wintering partners were
becoming so concerned about the violence and trading losses that they
threatened to withdraw from the partnership when it expired and to
negotiate to join the Hudson's Bay Company themselves.
The Hudson's Bay Company may also have become concerned that
its position on the charter was no longer tenable. Although the Hudson's
Bay Company had been collecting evidence on Northwest Company
trespass on its property, the Northwest Company actually initiated
proceedings. In late 1815 and early 1816, the Northwest Company wrote
to the Colonial Office, challenging the charter as the basis for the Red
River Settlement.48 In 1817, the Colonial Office's representative to the
government, W. B. Coltman, found the charter (and hence the settle-

ment) void, because of the long period of nonuse.49 The Hudson's Bay
Company's concern was that this would become the government
position. In fact, by 1819 the British government was becoming very
concerned about the state of affairs in its "Indian countries" and was
beginning to question the companies about events in British North
America. In 1820 the government informed both parties that it "might
be disposed to go into and confirm any arrangement the parties might
make between themselves.' 50
The response was immediate and dramatic. In 1821 the firms agreed
to merge, creating a monopolist in the North America fur trade. The
agreement specified that each company would provide an equal share of
capital and that trade was to be carried on for twenty-one years under
the name of The Hudson's Bay Company and under its charter. Trade

was to be conducted by a board consisting of the Hudson's Bay
Company governor, two Hudson's Bay Company committee members,
and two Northwest Company members. It was to use the London
agencies of the Hudson's Bay Company and be carried out through
Hudson Bay. Profits were to be divided annually into one hundred

shares dispersed as follows: twenty each to Hudson's Bay Company
and Northwest Company proprietors, forty to "persons actually employed in conducting the trade in North America," ten held in reserve,
five to Lord Selkirk's heirs, and five to Simon McGillivray and Edward

Ellice, two Northwest Company partners, for loss of their London

agency.51

VII. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Why did the Hudson's Bay Company and the Northwest Company
take seventeen years to reach an agreement and dissipate the resource
rents in the process when the market structure and freedom from
antitrust suggest that the firms should have arrived at an agreement
quickly? Analysis of the attempts by these two companies to reach an
agreement suggests that they did indeed want to maximize profits and
that they understood the gains from cooperating and the dangers
inherent in delaying. But, the documents also reveal that changes in the

input-output market, the historical environment regarding the charter,
and the nature of the bargaining process combined to make it particularly difficult for the firms to reach agreement.
The features which are important here are essential for explaining the

long delay in achieving agreement and for illuminating aspects of
current bargaining theory. Uncertainties regarding actual profits, relative bargaining strengths of the respective parties, and extent of
commitment to strategies made the bargaining process somewhat indirect. Neither side wished to reveal very much about itself, but each
wanted to find out as much as it could about the other side. It is even

possible to make some sense of their unwillingness to get opinions on
the charter in these terms. It may have seemed better for each firm to
come to agreement on a mechanism for distributing the profits before
seeking a ruling on the charter. And, in some sense, that is what they
finally did. They agreed to a merger, and then the government agreed to
honor the charter.
Because of the uncertainty and the unwillingness of each firm to
reveal very much, the bargaining process was extremely long, and most
of the profits were dissipated. The firms began with a round of
unreasonable offers and counteroffers, each trying to begin in the most
advantageous position and to keep the other firm guessing. Next, each
firm tried to learn as much as it could about the other firm, exploring the
strength of the other's bargaining position. Had there not been a
blockade and depletion of the animal stocks, it is likely the firms would
have reached agreement on a mechanism much earlier.
However, change in the environment altered the information structure and the benefits from playing the game. The absolute and relative

positions of the firms changed, and they had to begin the process all over

again.52 Once again, neither side wished to reveal much about itself and
each probably believed it was weak as a result of the environmental
deterioration. Each side knew the surplus was smaller, but neither
wanted to accept less than it had expected from the original round of
bargaining. But to get back to its 1804 position, each side would have
had to get more than 50 percent of the surplus available in 1816. When
they both tried to do just that, they nearly destroyed one another and the
entire fur trade.
VIII. POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

The analysis presented here may provide a framework for studying
other duopolies (or small groups of firms) in economic history, especially in cases where standard economic theory does not seem to
account for the observed historical developments. Whenever members
of an industry with few firms have direct contact with one another, the
possibility exists that their interaction is better understood in terms of
bargaining under incomplete information than in terms of noncooperative duopoly or imperfect competition theory. For example, the growth
of the railroads in the Midwest in the 1860s and the merger movement
in the late nineteenth century involved a few firms in each case and
those firms maintained close contact with one another. Reference to
bargaining theory might add to understanding these developments.53

52 actual personnel on the Hudson's Bay Company committee had also changed. By 1810 t
composition of the committee was quite different from what it had been in 1804.
53 There is already some other work in economic history which uses bargaining theory. We have

already mentioned Enders and Macleod, "Competition and Collusion." There is also the work of
