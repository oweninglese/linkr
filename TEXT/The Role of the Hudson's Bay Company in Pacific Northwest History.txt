tory."1 The governing authority of the Company
was reiterated in 1821 in "A Bill for regulating

the Fur Trade and establishing a Criminal and

Civil Jurisdiction within certain Parts of North
America/'2 The British government expected the
Company to maintain order, to prevent foreigners from trespassing on British soil, and to keep
the Indians quiet. Sir George Simpson, who was
appointed governor, became responsible for profits and for peace.

Sir George discharged his assignment magnificently. A competitor, who at first looked
upon the appointment with condescension (Sir
George was "reputed a gentlemanly man" who

would "not create much alarm, nor do I presume

him formidable as an Indian trader"), changed
his opinion within three years. He grumbled

against any white man, even its enemies. Other-

wise, it left the Indian to his own devices. The

Company made little or no deliberate effort to
impose European customs on him. It played no
part in inter-tribal or inter-village quarrels. It

did not interfere with Indian law or justice

where it concerned Indians alone. Above all,

while Company traders did on occasion trick the
Indians, the Company itself did not cheat them
in business dealings, nor did it try to push them
off their lands or move them to another part of

the continent.

Examples of Hudson's Bay policy toward the

Indians are numerous. Doubtless, some readers

are familiar with that part of American folklore
which tells how Chief Factor John McLoughlin
