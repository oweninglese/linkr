Abstract
This article provides some thoughts on the impacts of the conservation vs development paradigm on First Nations,
as it has played out in the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement and the Far North Act in northern Ontario, Canada.
The author contends that the dichotomy between conservation and development does not fit the First Nations’
worldview in which First Nations assume responsibility for land stewardship. The author points to the need for
non-governmental organisations (especially environmental non-governmental organisations) and the private
sector to respect, and learn from, First Nations by ensuring they play a key role in decision making about land
and resource use in their territories—one based on free, prior, and informed consent.
Keywords: boreal, forest management, conservation, Indigenous peoples, Aboriginal and treaty rights, Ontario,
Canada

INTRODUCTION
Across the boreal forests of northern Canada, the paradigm of
development vs conservation has defined policy development
in the natural resource sectors. Canada’s boreal forest
has become a highly publicised, contested ground in the
international debate to either develop lands and resources or set
them aside in protected areas. This special section is designed
to highlight Canadian cases illustrating improved collaboration
between actors involved in protected areas and commercial
forest harvesting. While there are examples of ‘cooperative
relations’ with First Nationsi in both protected areas and forest
management, this is not always the case. In order to promote
more cooperative relations and learning from First Nation
worldviews, a closer examination of the shortcomings of
the current relationships with First Nations around land-use
decisions being made in their territories is needed. This paperii

will focus on three ‘conflictual’ case studies that promoted
protected areas in northern Ontario’s boreal forest—the Ontario
Forest Accord, 1999; the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement,
2010; and the Far North Act, 2010. These initiatives developed
in the context of a growing boreal conservation movement and
faced resistance from First Nations.
The Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA) in particular
has been discussed in other papers of this special section as a
breakthrough example of collaboration, with environmental
non-governmental organisations (ENGOs) and forest companies
finding common ground, overcoming what was previously ‘a
war in the woods’ over conservation vs development. However,
First Nations were not part of negotiating this agreement,
and several First Nations, particularly in eastern Canada,
have called for the cancellation of the agreement. Rather
than providing models for collaboration, the author contends
that the boreal conservation movement has alienated some
First Nations by ignoring their role in decision making in
their homelands. Squeezed on one side by industrial interests
promising economic development—the ‘rock’ (mining, but
also forestry and energy), and, on the other, by conservation
organisations seeking an increase in protected areas with
threatened wildlife species as a focus—the ‘caribou’,
First Nation voices are largely ignored in policy decisions
transforming their traditional territories (lands they have
historically occupied, used, and managed). This is happening

in spite of First Nations’ constitutionally acknowledged rights
based on their prior occupancy of land and their continued
use and occupation of the targeted boreal forest. While this
article does deal with both industry and ENGOs when they
have both been involved in brokering deals, the emphasis is
on the role of the ENGOs that have spearheaded the boreal
conservation movement.
Through this exploration, it is hoped that those involved in
making policy—from the provincial governments that set and
implement policy for the development of natural resources
within their boundaries, including the establishment of
protected areas, to the ENGOs and forest industry that influence
policy—will re-examine their treatment of First Nations and
find new ways to formulate and implement policies that respect
First Nations rights and interests in the boreal forest.iii The
case studies of three key events in the boreal conservation
movement in Ontario reveal lost opportunities for effective
collaboration with First Nations. A new approach is needed that
would be in keeping with the spirit and intent of the treaties
signed with the Crown (representing the public interest),
that is to share lands and resources, as well as with the UN
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)
that recommends seeking Indigenous peoples’ ‘full, prior and
informed consent’ in natural resource development.
The case studies, or perhaps more aptly titled ‘stories’, are
based on the author’s participation in, and study of, numerous
activities that have been part of the boreal conservation
movement, including an early strategic planning meeting
with the Pew Charitable Trusts (PCT) in northwestern
Ontario in 1999, involvement in the development of the
Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) of Canada since 1993
and its national boreal standard, and participation in an
ongoing research project with Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN)
exploring the dichotomy between utilisation and conservation
in relation to climate change. The author was involved in
some of these initiatives through the National Aboriginal
Forestry Association. It is one woman’s perspective. The
author is of Cree ancestry from the James Bay region of
northern Ontario.

History
Historic or numbered treaties were entered into between the
Crown and First Nations across large parts of the country
from the late 1700s through to the early 1900s, while British
Columbia, parts of the northern territories, Quebec, and
Labrador have only in more recent history undertaken land
claims or treaty negotiations (Global Forest Watch 2000:
Map 10). Northern Ontario is covered by historic treaties—the
Robinson treaties along Lake Superior (1850s), Treaty #3
(1873), Treaty #5 (1875), and Treaty #9 (1905–1906, with
adhesions in 1929–1930) (Figure 1). v These areas are
represented by Provincial-Territorial Organizations that serve
as a political voice for their member First Nations. These
include Grand Council Treaty #3 representing 28 First Nations
in northwestern Ontario, Anishinabek Nation representing
40 First Nations that are signatories to the Robinson treaties,
and Nishnawbe Aski Nation representing 49 communities
in the Treaties 5 and 9 areas. There are also a number of
‘Independent’ First Nations in the region.
First Nations view their Aboriginal and treaty rights as
intimately linked to the land. This is due in large part to the
fact that over centuries, their very existence has depended
on the lands and the waters they inhabited. The alienation of
First Nations from their traditional territories, as a result of
colonisation by the French and English, began in the sixteenth
century in Canada. Initially relationships between First Nations
and the colonisers were co-operative, based on mutual need
both for the success of the fur trade economy and military
alliances (Magocsi 1999: 7). However, from the mid‒1700s
to the present day, government policy has tended toward
assimilation, one dimension of what Tully (2000: 38–39)
describes as a process of “internal colonization”, a process
whereby formerly self-sufficient societies have been reduced to
poverty, dependency, alienation, and social chaos. Even though
the British Royal Proclamation of 1763 recognised Indigenous
peoples in Canada as prior occupants and sovereign nations,

Background
About 80% of the 617 First Nations iv communities in
Canada are located within the commercial forest zone
(NAFA 1994: 1), most of them within the boreal region that
stretches across northern Canada from Labrador through the
provincial norths and into the southern portions of the Yukon
and Northwest Territories. Indian reserves (those lands owned
and controlled by the federal government that were set aside
for First Nations use) collectively consist of less than 1% of
commercial forests, but the areas historically and currently
used for traditional activities by First Nations peoples are vast.
Ownership of these lands has been claimed both by provinces
that define them as ‘Crown’ land and by First Nations that
define them as ‘traditional territories’.

and instructed agents of the Crown to enter into agreements
seeking First Nations’ consent before any land was taken up
for settlement or development (Borrows 1997), policies of
assimilation soon prevailed, in spite of the treaties that flowed
out of the Royal Proclamation.
Background on the protection of Aboriginal and treaty
rights
In spite of the recognition of Aboriginal and treaty rights in
Canada’s Constitution Act, 1982, today Aboriginal rights in
relation to forest land continue to be minimised and ignored,
not only by the state, but also by other actors influencing
natural resource policy. First Nations communities and
organisations continue to insist that, because of their unique
place in Canadian society, based on the recognition of their
rights and their prior occupancy of Canada, they are ‘not just
another stakeholder’ to be treated similarly to the general
public (Smith 1996). The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC)
agrees that the Crown holds a fiduciary or trust responsibility
to act in the best interests of First Nations in order to protect
their rights, while at the same time balancing the interests of
the broader society (Hurley 2000).
Canada’s Constitution acknowledged Aboriginal and treaty
rights in 1982, but the original 1867 British North America
Act delegated responsibility for ‘Indians and the lands reserved
for Indians’ to the federal government [section. 91(24)],
while giving provinces authority over the lands and resources
within provincial boundaries (Section 92). This created a
jurisdictional tangle in which the provinces, in dealing with
First Nations interests in lands and resources, would claim
that ‘Indians’ were a responsibility of the federal government,
while the federal government, when asked to represent First
Nations interests in lands with the provinces, would claim that
natural resource management was a provincial responsibility.
For over 100 years this ‘passing of the buck’ has left First
Nations issues in lands and resources unresolved. It is only
in the last twenty years that the SCC in numerous decisions
has clarified the intent of the concept of recognising and
affirming Aboriginal and treaty rights contained in section 35 of
Canada’s Constitution. The SCC has clarified that ‘the Crown’
is indivisible and that, although the federal government still has
responsibility for ‘Indians and the lands reserved for Indians’,
provincial governments also have a responsibility to address
Aboriginal and treaty rights in resource development, what the
Supreme Court has called ‘the duty to consult’ (Lawrence and
Macklem 2000). How to reconcile Crown-Aboriginal interests
in natural resources remains one of the most pressing issues
faced by Canadians.
International recognition of Indigenous rights has also
evolved with the UNDRIP (UNGA 2007) that incorporates
the principle of ‘free, prior and informed consent’ (FPIC) in a
number of situations: before nation states adopt or implement
legislation or administrative measures which may affect
Indigenous peoples (Article 19), redress where their lands have
been ‘confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without

their free, prior and informed consent’ (Article 28), and before
the ‘development, utilisation or exploitation of mineral, water
or other resource’ (Article 32).
While the Courts and UNDRIP have clarified that it is the
Crown or nation states who hold both a fiduciary duty and a
duty to consult to protect Aboriginal and treaty rights, the role
of non-governmental organisations in upholding Aboriginal
and treaty rights has not been adequately discussed. What
responsibilities should be exercised by other stakeholders who
are influencing policies that have an impact on First Nations,
including non-governmental organisations who are promoting
more protected areas or private industry pursuing commercial
development (Smith et al. 2010)? UNDRIP acknowledges that
not only nation states, but ‘other parties’ have an obligation
to address infringements of Indigenous rights in Article 40:
	Indigenous peoples have the right to have access to
and prompt decision through just and fair procedures
for the resolution of conflicts and disputes with
States or other parties [emphasis added], as well as
to effective remedies for all infringements of their
individual and collective rights. Such a decision shall
give due consideration to the customs, traditions,
rules and legal systems of the indigenous peoples
concerned and international human rights.
This is a crucial question given the increasing number of
actors attempting to influence lands and resources policies,
whether in favour of development or conservation. While the
policy regime in the past was described as a ‘state-business
nexus’ with industry a ‘client’ of government with ready
access to public policy makers (Howlett and Rayner 2001),
new actors, especially environmental non-governmental
organisations, have expanded the policy arena, effectively
advocating for policy changes that meet ENGO agendas.
The role of non-governmental actors in influencing
policy
Both industry and ENGOs now play a key role in natural
resource policy development. Provincial governments have
increasingly delegated responsibility for natural resource
management to industry, which raises questions about
industry’s obligations to First Nations in the course of their
operations. ENGOs at times align themselves strategically
with First Nations interest, when those interests meet their
conservation goals. However, ENGOs must consider First
Nations rights in their policy considerations even when their
goals conflict. Both industry and ENGOs, through their
influence on natural resource policy, influence the livelihoods
and rights of First Nations.
ENGOs have blossomed in their ability to influence
environmental policy. Dalton (2005) contends that it is
environmental groups in advanced industrial democracies that
will remain the largest and most influential at the international
level in supporting actions to protect the environment in the
‘developing’ world. Although First Nations in Canada are part

26 / Smith
of a so-called developed country, they have been described as
“a colony within” (Watkins 1977), facing underdevelopment
that has resulted in poverty and social dysfunction on par
with developing countries. Therefore ENGOs who promote
conservation initiatives within Canada carry the same influence
as they do in developing countries and, as such, they assume a
responsibility to the communities who will be affected by the
policies adopted as a result of this influence.
ENGOs have mounted powerful, market-based campaigns to
add legitimacy to their demands for wholesale policy changes
in Ontario. There is little public debate about the wisdom
of these advocated changes, although governments, both
provincial and federal, have responded by adopting policies
promoted by ENGOs. As Baldwin (2004: 186) points out, the
boreal forest has been a political landscape since colonisation.
From the moment the boreal forest was mapped in the 1930s,
‘it became a political space’. Baldwin discusses how early
national polices ensured those valuable forests were exploited
and ‘managed under the auspices of a national forest policy
by professional foresters in accordance with the principles of
scientific forestry.’
No longer is the boreal forest solely a national treasure; it
is now considered an international treasure being shaped by
both industrial and conservation forces outside of Canada’s
borders. Although First Nations’ influence in natural resources
development is growing as a result of the SCC decisions,
in practice First Nations have little say in campaigns that
promote either commercial development or conservation. As
such, the policies that are promoted in these campaigns are
missing the essential input of First Nations whose worldviews
might lead to ways to overcome the dichotomy between
development and conservation. Baldwin calls for a new ethic
that would bring together the social-economic and ecological,
and acknowledge the Indigenous peoples living in the boreal:
	… it [a new ethic] must begin with the recognition
that people live within the space circumscribed by
the boreal sign; people who suffer the legacy of
the residential school system; people whose lands
have been flooded for hydro-electric power; people
once employed by the resource sector; people from
the south; climatologists and conservation biologists.
It must also recognize the socio-ecological porosity
of the boreal forest; this amounts to a recognition
that distant others not circumscribed by the boreal
sign could be affected by a boreal politics of closure
and protection and that those choosing to invoke the
boreal signifier in the construction of cultural identity
bear a responsibility towards those outside affected.
(Baldwin 2004: 193)
Cartwright (2003) described the variety of ENGOs in
Ontario following a land-use planning exercise in the late
1990s that will be discussed later. He pointed to the variety of
tactics ENGOs employed in attempting to shape the provincial
environmental regime. These groups ranged from the Nature
Conservancy with its dependence on corporate support, taking

care not to publicly criticise government policies, through to
the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the Federation of Ontario
Naturalists (now Ontario Nature) who quietly negotiate while
at the same time publicly criticise and mount campaigns against
the government, through to Earthroots, an ENGO known for
the more forceful action of blockading (Cartwright 2003:
120). Some of these same ENGOs were later also involved
in promoting the Far North Act and the Canadian Boreal
Forest Agreement, quietly negotiating behind the scenes
with government and industry, while avoiding any direct
negotiations with First Nations who might oppose their
direction or offer an alternative approach to conservation.
As ENGOs have increased their influence, there has been
more attention paid to the results of their conservation
campaigns on local communities and, in particular, Indigenous
communities. In 2004, an international debate was sparked
by Chapin’s A challenge to conservationists, in which
Chapin raised an alarm about a change he had observed in
the conservation movement—a move away from working
closely with local communities and developing alliances
with Indigenous peoples. Instead, large conservation groups
began to focus on “large-scale conservation strategies and the
importance of science, rather than social realities resources”
(Chapin 2004: 18).
Chapin described the response from some Indigenous
communities to conservation campaigns noting that they
feel that the setting aside of ‘protected areas’ often means
their exclusion, sometimes evictions, and an infringement
on their rights. Not only are Indigenous people excluded,
but often conservation organisations turn to partnerships
with multinational corporations ‘that are directly involved in
pillaging and destroying forest areas owned by indigenous
peoples’ (Chapin 2004: 18).
Many of Chapin’s arguments ring true in the Ontario
situation, including pursuing alliances with the private
sector, excluding Indigenous peoples from decision making,
ignoring Indigenous rights, failing to seek the free, prior, and
informed consent of affected First Nations, and promoting the
conservation goal of seeking ever larger areas of ‘protection’
while ignoring local community concerns. It should be noted
that ENGOs have not excluded all First Nations affected by
their proposed conservation policies. Among the 34 First
Nations in the far northern boreal, there are a few who
support the ENGO approach to increasing protected areas.
First Nations are not monolithic in their views and they often
have disagreements about approaches to lands and resources.
However, the spirit of free, prior, and informed consent is that
all First Nations who will be affected should be consulted and
their consent sought, especially if they disagree with proposed
policies. The tendency of ENGOs is to work only with those
First Nations who agree with their approach to protected areas
or wildlife protection strategies.
Chapin’s challenge was met by lively and thoughtful
responses from many—from the conservation groups he
challenged to others who supported the critique of the ENGOs’
relationships with Indigenous peoples. Veit et al. (2004: 11)

captured the essence of the dilemma of melding conservation
with social justice, by asking the question—‘How shall we
organize ourselves to both protect nature and promote human
wellbeing?’—and then providing the answer. Prior informed
consent, compensation for lands and resources set aside for
conservation, public debate of environmental concerns, and
transparency and accountability in decision making were
among the answers. These same approaches need to be applied
in Ontario’s boreal forest.
Indigenous peoples and conservation
The idea that Indigenous peoples are natural conservationists
and therefore natural allies for environmental groups has been
challenged by a number of authors, in particular Krech (1999:
98–99) in The ecological Indian. He contends that Amerindians
caused animal extinctions through wasteful hunting practices
and used environmentally destructive burning practices.
Within the Canadian environmental movement, Orton (1996)
described himself as a ‘left biocentrist’ who believes that ‘a
transformed anti-industrial socialism’ could still be relevant,
if it incorporated justice for non-human species, was against
economic growth and consumerism, and was for human
population reduction and a frugal lifestyle.’ He challenged
environmentalists and First Nations who put social justice
before environmental issues, such as support for historic
treaties and First Nations hunting, fishing, and trapping rights.
He criticised environmentalists who accept ‘without public
questioning of aboriginal claims, statements and demands and
that natives define the terms of reference of any alliance with
environmentalists’ and promote
	a particular faction within a native community
which has itself sought out contact with non-native
environmentalists, thereby ignoring significant
differences regarding social justice and ecological
understanding within the native community.
H e a rg u e d t h a t i t i s n e c e s s a r y t o ‘ g o b e y o n d
human-centeredness, beyond treaties, and beyond
land ownership and property rights’ and that ‘Native
self-government must accept present day ecological and social
imperatives, and discard the haggling over 18th century treaty
rights.’ Orton’s critique underlies the tension that exists within
the environmental movement about First Nations’ claims
for recognition of their rights, including environmental and
social justice. Positions such as Orton and Krech’s are used
in large part to support arguments against the recognition of
Aboriginal and treaty rights and the exclusion of First Nations
from decision making. Miller et al. (2011) have classified those
who hold such views as ‘nature protectionists’ as opposed to
‘social conservationists’ who consider poverty alleviation an
essential element of biodiversity protection.
What can Indigenous peoples bring to the debate about
conservation vs development? Common property theorists
have pointed out that the establishment of protected areas
through top-down, state-imposed regulations does not

necessarily guarantee sustainability. In fact, empirical studies
have shown that local people can and do manage resources
sustainably if they have the ability to make, monitor, and
enforce their own rules (Hayes and Ostrom 2005). ‘Indigenous
Community Conserved Areas’ (ICCAs) have been proposed
as a way of bringing local knowledge into decision making
and interconnecting biodiversity and cultural diversity through
cultural meaning (Berkes 2004, 2007; Robson and Berkes
2010).
An example of the potential Indigenous contribution to this
debate is the case of the Whitefeather Forest Initiative in the
northern boreal forest. In their land-use strategy, developed
jointly with the Ontario government, Pikangikum First Nation
described how they have learned to ‘keep the land’ based on
their centuries-old firsthand knowledge of their territory and
the understanding that caring for this land is a responsibility
that comes from the Creator. They say: ‘Our Elders have
taught us that our ancestral lands are a sacred gift from the
Creator that provides for our continued way of life, including
enduring livelihood opportunities for our people’ [emphasis
added] (PFN 2006: 1). For Pikangikum people, looking
after their land includes using it for the economic wellbeing
of their people and, in fact, ‘it is through our livelihood
activities that we understand and monitor ecological process,
that we learn how to protect the land for future generations’
(PFN 2006: 8). This Indigenous worldview and approach could
help in transforming the way we practice stewardship. In fact,
some authors think that such a ‘convergence’ is needed to move
beyond the polarised debate about biodiversity protection vs
human wellbeing (Miller et al. 2011).
Some international conservation agencies are acknowledging
the need to foster more effective collaboration between
Indigenous peoples, conservation organisations, and
governments. The International Union for Conservation of
Nature (IUCN) has developed guiding principles for equitable
forms of conservation and resource management such as
‘Principle One: [Indigenous peoples] should be recognised as
rightful, equal partners in the development and implementation
of conservation strategies that affect their lands, territories,
waters, coastal seas, and other resources, and in particular in
the establishment and management of protected areas’ (Beltrán
2000: ix). The IUCN states that decentralisation, participation,
transparency, and accountability are fundamental to achieving
this principle and recommends the implementation of
co-management structures in protected areas where Indigenous
peoples are affected, and the reinforcement and extension of
co-management where it already exists (Beltrán 2000).
THE BOREAL CONSERVATION MOVEMENT
WITH A FOCUS ON ONTARIO
Background of the boreal conservation movement
In the early 1990s, ENGO protests about forest management
practices focused on the ‘old growth’ coastal rainforests of
British Columbia, epitomised by protests in Clayoquot Sound

on Vancouver Island. By the late 1990s, ENGOs began to focus
on the boreal forests of Canada (see Table 1 for a chronology).
For example, the Sierra Club of Canada, which had been active
in Clayoquot, appeared before the Senate Sub-Committee
on the Boreal Forest in 1997 (Senate Sub-Committee on
the Boreal 1999). As the boreal conservation movement grew,
several other ENGOs involved in Clayoquot took up the
boreal cause, including Greenpeace and the Western Canada
Wilderness Committee.
In 1992, the first international ENGO devoted to protecting
northern forests—the Taiga Rescue Network—was formed
(NRTEE 2005: 82). In 1993, the FSC was formed, strongly
supported by ENGOs, to promote certification of forest
products as a way of using the marketplace to put pressure
on forest companies to change their forestry practices. FSC
Canada developed several regional standards, culminating in
the National Boreal Standard in 2004. The development of this
standard was influenced by inputs from the ‘chambers’ that
make up the FSC—social, economic, environmental and, in
Canada, Aboriginal—largely with funding from the PCT. The
National Boreal Standard was also influenced by the growing
boreal conservation movement.
A 1997 report by the Washington-based NGO, the World
Resources Institute (WRI), titled Last frontier forests (Bryant
et al. 1997), graphically illustrated that the largest ‘relatively

undisturbed’ or ‘frontier’ forests (also termed by ENGOs
as ‘intact’ forests), as pictured from satellite imagery, were
located in the circumpolar boreal region. In the same year, the
Government of Canada turned its attention to the boreal forest,
establishing a Senate Sub-Committee on the Boreal Forest that
filed its final report Competing realities: the boreal forest at
risk in 1999, echoing the WRI’s language and concerns about
threats to the boreal forest: ‘Portions of Canada’s remaining
natural, undisturbed boreal forest and its areas of old growth are
now at risk’ (Senate Sub-Committee on the Boreal Forest 1999:
Executive Summary). The Sub-Committee recommended a
20-20-60 formula with 20% of the boreal forest to be managed
intensively, 20% to be protected, and 60% to be ‘managed at a
less intensive level over a broader area, with long-term leases,
audited regularly by community groups assisting forestry
experts.’ The Sub-Committee’s recommendations were not
acted on by the federal government and discussions about how
much protection of the boreal is enough became centred in the
boreal conservation movement.

collaborators—the World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWFC),
the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society-Wildlands League
(CPAWS-WL), and the Federation of Ontario Naturalists
(FON, now Ontario Nature)—exercised significant influence
during the Lands for Life planning exercise. In spite of a
public process that established three ‘round tables’ with a
range of ‘stakeholder’ input to put forward recommendations
to the provincial government on future land use, in the end
it was the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR),
the PPL and representatives of the forest industry in Ontario
whose recommendations were implemented in the Ontario
Forest Accord (OMNR 1999). ENGOs were disappointed
in the public round tables’ recommendations that limited
the expansion of parks in the north (Cartwright 2003). By
negotiating directly with government and industry, ENGOs
had an opportunity to increase the amount of protected area
in Ontario, a significant accomplishment through negotiations
rather than conflict, noted later by the executive director of
FON during the Accord period:
	I think the 1999 Ontario Forest Accord, the heart of
Ontario’s Living Legacy, was an amazing departure
from our traditional adversarial approaches to
planning and the forest industry. Its direct negotiations
led to a breakthrough in securing protected areas
wholesale rather than one by one. It also worked out a
relationship with the forest industry [in which] we can
both participate in the planning process in a positive
way, a different and better way of doing things. (Reid
2003: 17)
The essence of the Accord met the demands of both ENGOs
and industry, and was dubbed a ‘win-win’ for both parties.
Parks and protected areas would be increased from 8% to
12% while ensuring that industry did not lose any wood
supply. To make up for the potential loss of wood supply
due to the establishment of new parks, the Accord pointed to
the need for ‘intensive forest management’ and allowed for
the ‘orderly development of the north’ (section 24) (OMNR
1999), the area north of current forest management activities,
roughly the 50th–51st parallel, now called ‘the Far North’. The
outcome maintained the dichotomy between conservation and
development, between ENGOs and industry, and set the tone
for future actions in the boreal forest. No room was made for
First Nations voices who might have offered a different view
of land use in their territories.
Although Aboriginal groups had participated in the round
table land-use planning process in the beginning, in 1998 the
representatives of all four Provincial-Territorial Organizations
in Ontario rejected the initiative (COO 1998)
	because the government was ignoring their concerns
over ‘land stewardship, jurisdiction, treaty and
aboriginal rights’, and treating them as simply one
more interest group…. they were not opposed to

development; they simply wanted a fair share of the
proceeds (Cartwright 2003: 121).
Aboriginal representatives were not part of the process
of negotiating the Accord. There was no consultation with
Aboriginal groups on the impacts of the Accord on their
land use or rights. Needless to say, Aboriginal groups were
unhappy with their exclusion, and especially critical of the
ENGOs who had participated in signing the deal without
consultation. Most changes that resulted from the Accord
neglected Aboriginal peoples, with the exception of a provision
for First Nations’ consent for ‘the orderly development of
the north’ (NRTEE 2003–2004). Although the provision for
consent was included, when it came to decisions about new
legislation in the Far North in 2010, Aboriginal consent was
not part of the deal, as will be discussed later. In a presentation
to an OMNR-sponsored workshop following the signing of
the Accord, the author pointed to the exclusion of Aboriginal
peoples in Lands for Life:
	The relationship between the province and Aboriginal
peoples—the Cree and Ojibway Nations—has
suffered because of the Lands for Life process. Lands
for Life is described as a model of cooperation,
a win-win situation. Unfortunately, the province
elevated the forest industry and environmental
groups to equals at the negotiating table and left out
Aboriginal peoples. The 3 winning groups (provincial
government, forest industry, and Partnership for
Public Lands) negotiated a package that increased
protected areas and ensured no reduction in wood
supply to the existing companies. Aboriginal rights,
increasingly being recognized as prior and unique
rights by the Courts, were ignored…. aboriginal
organizations were not invited to the table, but the
decisions profoundly affect their ability to exercise
treaty rights such as hunting, fishing, gathering, and
trapping, and limit their ability to share in economic
benefits because there is no unallocated wood left in
Ontario. This is not a win-win situation. (Bell et al.
2000: 27–28)
This rift with the environmental movement was never fully
mended, although there were attempts by both ENGOs and
Aboriginal groups to clear the air, with Aboriginal groups
taking great pains to explain their treaty rights to ENGOs.
On the ENGOs’ side, CPAWS-WL, for example, created
mechanisms to explore Aboriginal-ENGO relationships and
concepts of protected areas. One such effort was a research
report with the National Aboriginal Forestry Association,
titled Honouring the promise: Aboriginal values in protected
areas in Canada (NAFA and CPAWS-WL 2003). The report
recognised the historic exclusion of Aboriginal peoples from
decisions about establishing parks and the need to redress
these injustices:
	Many recent efforts to expand our protected-areas
systems across the country have actively sought

to involve Aboriginal communities. These efforts
have led to a more positive view of protected areas
among many Aboriginal peoples. However, historic
grievances with many older existing protected areas
have yet to be addressed and these grievances continue
to undermine the support and goodwill for protected
areas gained through more inclusive park planning
and management initiatives. In some instances there
has been significant interference with traditional
activities and traditions. In addition, intensive
visitor use and related developments have caused
significant ecological damage to areas whose integrity
was previously sustained through generations of
Aboriginal stewardship. Finally, Aboriginal rights
and land-claim issues have often been disregarded in
park creation, leading to the exclusion of Aboriginal
peoples and their interests in protected-areas planning.
These historic injustices must be addressed. (NAFA
and CPAWS-WL 2003: 45)
CPAWS-WL also partnered with other conservation groups
and First Nations to organise a workshop to discuss approaches
to protected areas in the northern boreal forest. Several themes
emerged, among them that conservation groups need to better
understand and respect Aboriginal and treaty rights when
negotiating agreements, that First Nations should be in control
of decisions about land use in their traditional territories, and
that there is a need for collaboration on common goals to build
trust and relationships between ENGOs and First Nations
(CPAWS-WL and Manitoba Wildlands 2005).
However, the acknowledgement of the need for historical
redress and respect for Aboriginal rights and control over
their lands were not reflected in the ENGO’s ongoing boreal
campaign. Instead that campaign centred on a moratorium on
large-scale natural resource development in the Far North,
an increase in protected areas, and protection of woodland
caribou. Even though the Ontario Forest Accord had provided
for the ‘orderly development of the north’, it had also called for
conservation areas to be set aside before any development
occurred; this became the ENGO focus.
Not all the First Nations communities in the Far North
were on the same page about these development issues. The
Province of Ontario, in response to both the Ontario Forest
Accord and First Nations’ requests, put in place the Northern
Boreal Initiative that provided for community-based land-use
planning. Some First Nations embraced the opportunity to
use this planning approach as a way to influence or control
development in their territories while others sat on the
sidelines, not quite trusting that this provincial-led process
would result in any different kind of relationship. While
ENGOs supported community-based land-use planning in
principle, they continued to focus on increasing protected areas
and promoted comprehensive land-use planning for the entire
Far North as a way of achieving this.
CPAWS-WL took the positive step of negotiating an
agreement with Pikangikum First Nation to develop jointly an

approach to protected areas within Pikangikum’s traditional
use area. However, their demand for comprehensive land-use
planning ignored those First Nations communities, like
Pikangikum, that embraced the community-based land-use
planning approach. CPAWS-WL justified their call for
comprehensive land-use planning because they believed it
could:
	Ensure all values of the land are addressed
before resource extraction occurs; identify areas
to be protected through legislation based on all
available information (natural, cultural, ceremonial);
identify areas for industrial activity based on all
available information (forestry, mining, hydro),
ensure community benefits are addressed and
agreed to, and ensure proper flow of benefits to First
Nation communities; and ensure community and
environmental values are protected and consensus
is achieved. (CPAWS-WL 2006)
Part of the call for comprehensive land-use planning was
the demand for a moratorium on natural resource development
until such planning took place. In 2005, CPAWS-WL launched
its Boreal Wild campaign ‘to save Ontario’s remaining intact
boreal forest region’ (CPAWS-WL 2005a). CPAWS-WL and
Ontario Nature chose to focus, in particular, on the protection
of the endangered woodland caribou (CPAWS-WL 2005b)
and wolverine. These groups were tentative about Aboriginal
peoples’ involvement in development, even though they
recognised the ‘strong need’ for such development with
unemployment rates in First Nations running between
65–95% (CPAWS-WL 2005c). The ENGOs were much more
comfortable with First Nations who adopted their approach.
There was at least one among the almost 34 First Nations in
the region that supported the ENGO call for a moratorium
on development. Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug (KI,
formerly Big Trout First Nation) had called for a moratorium
on logging and mining in their territory. In turn, they were
supported by the ENGOs. In 2008, CPAWS-WL honoured
both the Premier of Ontario and KI for ‘protecting the Boreal
Forest’ (CPAWS-WL 2008).
A CPAWS-WL representative warned that further action
would be taken if the province did not carry out comprehensive
land-use planning:
	This is just the beginning…. Ontarians continue
to show their strong support for a moratorium on
industrial activities in the north. And we intend to
ensure that the province lives up to its promise to
provide adequate safeguards to protect the ecological
values of the remaining intact boreal landscape.
(SLDF 2006)
CPAWS-WL revealed its skepticism about the ability of
Aboriginal peoples to do their part in protecting the boreal:
	Under the enormous burden of social and economic
problems, community leaders may be pressured to

accept a few jobs instead of negotiating true impact
and benefit agreements with the government and large
companies that would give Aboriginal communities
control over resources and benefits that will generate
economic sustainability for future generations.
(CPAWS-WL 2005c)
CPAWS appointed itself the guardian of the boreal forest,
outlining that the best way to do this is to call for comprehensive
planning, a moratorium on development in the north, an
increase in protected areas, and the protection of woodland
caribou. While making verbal commitments to partnerships
with First Nations, CPAWS, in fact, demonstrated its distrust
that First Nations are capable of protecting the environment.
Large-scale industrial natural resource development, in their
eyes, continues to be the culprit, emphasising the jobs vs
environment dichotomy. Any First Nation willing to explore
development was treated with distrust.
The Canadian Boreal Initiative
While the boreal conservation movement’s effect was being felt
in Ontario during the Lands for Life process, at the international
and national levels the WRI and Senate Sub-Committee’s
reports attracted the attention of other international ENGOs
and foundations. Foundations began to provide funding to
promote conservation of the boreal forest. A key supporter
was the U.S.-based PCT. PCT coordinated a meeting of
national and international ENGOs in 1999 at the Quetico
Centre in northwestern Ontario to discuss strategies for boreal
conservation. The author attended that meeting and, together
with a representative of Nishnawbe Aski Nation (the only
First Nations representative in attendance), raised the issue
about First Nations involvement in environmental campaigns,
pointing to the need to acknowledge Indigenous rights and
ensure their role in decision making in their territories.
Shortly after this meeting, the Pew Environmental Group
officially launched an ‘international campaign to protect
Canada’s boreal forest from destructive development’ (PEG
2010). PCT funded the establishment of the Canadian Boreal
Initiative (CBI) and the Boreal Songbird Initiative in 2001
(PCT 2005). The boreal campaign launch was marked by
a major media piece on The great Northern Forest in 2002
(Montaigne 2002) in the National Geographic. Since then
hundreds of articles, many written by the ENGOs promoting
boreal conservation, have appeared in the international media
about the boreal, an ecosystem that until the 1990s had been
largely ignored.
The PCT’s funding of the CBI, of amounts estimated to
be over USD 60 million, being channelled from the USA to
Canada through Ducks Unlimited (Stainsby and Jay n.d.: 17),
led to the development of the Boreal Forest Conservation
Framework (BFCF) in 2003 (CBI 2003a) with a goal similar
to, but more ambitious than, the Senate Sub-Committee’s
20-20-60 formula. The BFCF called for conservation of the
‘entire Canadian Boreal Forest’, half as a ‘network of large

interconnected protected areas’ and for the other half to
provide support for ‘sustainable communities, world-leading
ecosystem-based resource management and state of the art
stewardship practices’ (CBI 2003b: 4).The former target
of 12% ‘protected areas’, set by the World Wildlife Fund’s
international Endangered Spaces campaign, was met in Ontario
in the 1990s. However, this amount was no longer considered
adequate. The CBI rationalised the 50% target by pointing out
that it was a simplification of the Senate Sub-Committee’s
20-20-60 formula, ‘by redistributing the 60% identified
for conservation equally between the protected areas and
sustainable land use goals’, allowing for ‘greater flexibility
in decision-making on the protected areas side’. The CBI
also pointed to conservation biology and landscape ecology
research that ‘supports the kind of large-scale conservation
planning anticipated by the Framework’ (CBI 2003c).
The ‘Boreal Leadership Council’, billed as an ‘extraordinary
alliance of conservation organizations, First Nations and
industry’, for which the CBI acts as a Secretariat, endorsed
the BFCF (CBI 2003a). The conservation groups included
Ducks Unlimited, Forest Ethics, the Nature Conservancy, the
Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, and the World Wildlife
Fund Canada. Industry signatories included the forest industry
companies Domtar, Tembec, and Alberta-Pacific, Suncor
Energy Inc., and the Ethical Funds Company; of these, Domtar,
Tembec, and Alberta-Pacific have sought FSC certification of
their forest operations across Canada.
As with the Ontario Far North campaign, there were some
First Nations endorsers—again a minority—made up of those
who support the ENGO agenda of protection. These included a
total of 19 First Nations (of the close to 500 in the commercial
forest zone across Canada): 12 Dehcho First Nations from the
Northwest Territories, the Innu Nation in Labrador representing
two First Nations, the Kaska Nation representing four First
Nations in British Columbia, the Yukon and the Northwest
Territories, and Poplar River First Nation in Manitoba. Since
its initial signing in 2006, several other organisations and
First Nations have endorsed the BFCF (CBI 2011), bringing
the number of First Nations endorsers to 73, approximately
15% of the First Nations in the commercial forest zone. The
newer endorsers include the Little Red River Cree Nation in
Alberta, the Moose Cree First Nation and the Mushkegowuk
Environmental Research Centre in Ontario (the only northern
Ontario supporters), the Prince Albert Grand Council
representing 12 First Nations in northern Saskatchewan, and
the Treaty 8 First Nations of Alberta comprising 39 First
Nations in northern Alberta.
Numerous USA-based ENGOs have been active in the boreal
conservation campaign with two playing a prominent role in
the BFCF—ForestEthics and the Nature Conservancy. Other
international ENGOs like the Natural Resources Defense
Council (NRDC) and the Rainforest Action Network (RAN)
have participated in market-based campaigns, promoting
the use of FSC certification (RAN 1995–2010; ForestEthics
2000–2011; NRDC 2011). These campaigns have called
for responsible consumerism and targeted the companies

these groups contend are destroying old growth, ‘ancient’
or ‘endangered’ forests in Canada’s boreal forest for toilet
paper (Kimberley Clark), catalogues (Victoria’s Secret),
copy paper (Xerox), and lumber for the USA housing market
(Weyerhaeuser).
The BFCF puts forward ‘a shared vision to sustain the
ecological and cultural integrity of the Canadian Boreal Forest
in perpetuity’ in which the boreal forest becomes the world’s
‘best conserved forest ecosystem’ while supporting northern
communities through sustainable practices. Among the BFCF
principles are two that address Aboriginal peoples: to ‘respect
the lands, rights and ways of life of Aboriginal people and
acknowledge and respect the leadership role of Aboriginal
people in achieving conservation goals on their traditional
lands.’ However, these principles remain hollow. Respect and
acknowledging Aboriginal leadership implies that First Nations
will play a key role in the decisions made in their territories,
something not yet achieved in Ontario’s Far North. Why it
is such a challenge to acknowledge First Nations rights and
involvement in Ontario is another paper; among a myriad of
reasons are: the ignoring of historic treaties by the Crown and
public in general, the insistence of the province that they have
sole control over these lands, the remoteness of the Far North,
and the minimal development that has occurred there so far.
The key point though is not that Ontario is different, but that
acknowledging and respecting Indigenous rights and their role
in decision making should be the practice across the country.
Ontario’s Far North Act
A direct result of the BFCF was the lobbying of the Province
of Ontario for the establishment of the 50% protection target
for the province’s Far North. In July 2008, Premier McGuinty
made an announcement that ‘Ontario will protect at least
225,000 sq. km of the Far North Boreal region under its Far
North Planning initiative’ (Premier of Ontario 2008). A few
months later, the Premier received an award from the CBI for
‘an outstanding contribution to protecting Canada’s Boreal
Forest’ (CBI 2008). The Far North Planning initiative was soon
translated into legislation—the Far North Act, 2010.
The Province of Ontario established the southern boundary
of the area designated ‘the Far North’ and describes the area as
spanning ‘the whole width of Northern Ontario, from Manitoba
in the west, to James Bay and Quebec in the east’, covering
more than 40% of the province or approximately 450,000 sq.
km, 225,000 of which are designated for ‘protection’ (OMNR
2011a). The province describes the Far North as ‘home to more
than 24,000 people living in 34 communities, most of which
are First Nations’ (OMNR 2011b). For the First Nations living
in the Far North, this is their homeland. They are represented
by the provincial-territorial organisation NAN that defends
the historic treaties signed in the Far North (Treaty #9 and
the Ontario portion of Treaty #5) (Figure 1). It is an area over
which they assert their Aboriginal and treaty rights. However,
the interpretation of these rights differs between the province
and NAN. While NAN contends that the treaties were about

sharing lands and resources and maintaining their ability to
make decisions about their homelands, the province contends
that in signing the treaties, First Nations ceded their lands
and territories, thus giving the province exclusive control.
Berger et al. (2010) describe this as the ‘unsteady footing from
which planning proceeds in the province.’
When Bill 191, the precursor to the Far North Act, was
tabled, NAN’s Grand Chief Stan Beardy asked the government
during legislative hearings to live up to recent SCC rulings
on ‘meaningful consultation’ with First Nations prior to
implementing land-use policy decisions. Beardy was speaking
on behalf of the Chiefs of NAN’s member communities. He
explained NAN’s position: ‘We want a meaningful partnership
which is based on our treaties. Bill 191 isn’t a partnership. It is
an entrenchment of the powers of MNR, and it is a violation
of our treaty understanding that we would coexist and share
as equal partners’ (LAO 2009). In those same hearings, the
CBI argued for First Nations consent to be provided for in
the legislation (LAO 2009), but in the end, First Nations were
restricted to local land-use planning subject to the protection
goals of the Act and the approval of the Minister. In 2010, the
NAN Chiefs again passed a resolution stating their opposition
to the Bill. In spite of the sustained and vigorous opposition
from NAN (Espinoza 2010), the Act received Royal Assent
on October 25, 2010 (OMNR 2011c). Although ENGOs were
aware of First Nations objections to the Act, most ENGOs
supported passage of the bill. Monte Hummel of the World
Wildlife Fund abdicated any responsibility for upholding
Aboriginal and treaty rights, declaring that:
	WWF is respectful of First Nations’ opposition to
the Bill, and we understand their concerns to revolve
around jurisdictional issues that can only be resolved
by government-to-government discussions, not by a
third-party conservation organization such as WWF...
We hope that these issues can be resolved by those
responsible in the near future. The sooner this can
be done, the sooner all interested parties can work
effectively together to ensure both protection and
new prosperity for Ontario’s northern communities.
(WWFC 2010)
Hummel went further in an interview, stating:
	I can’t imagine this act being rescinded is going
to leave [NAN Grand Chief] Stan Beardy or his
communities in a better position. I appreciate they
don’t agree with me and it’s their opinion that really
counts but the stakes are very high and my caution
based on 40 years’ experience is, before you kill this,
you want to think long and hard about what’s going
to replace it. (Thompson 2010)
Again, the failure of governments to resolve Aboriginal and
treaty rights became an excuse for ENGOs to continue to promote
an agenda that leaves First Nations out of decision making.
The Far North Act enables the protection of 225,000 sq. km,
allowing local land-use planning by First Nations under strict

guidelines established by the province. In a recent article to the
Forest Peoples Program E-newsletter, Audet (2011) explained
NAN’s opposition to the Act:
	By the stroke of a pen, Indigenous peoples are not
permitted to engage in most forms of modern economic
development throughout their homelands. Despite
their domestic and international rights, Indigenous
peoples in NAN will not be able to make their own
self-defined choices for balanced development and
conservation. The only way Indigenous peoples can
re-acquire development opportunities is to agree
to LUPs. These are the LUPs controlled by the
government, by which each First Nation must ‘agree’
to an allocation for the super-park. All of this amounts
to black-mail on a scale that might make a nineteenth
century imperialist blush.
Audet (2011) wrote directly about the role of conservation
organisations in the establishment of the Act:
	Over the 3 years of strenuous objections of NAN,
conservation organizations appeared sympathetic.
However, at a crucial time in the legislative process,
they became instrumental in supporting its enactment.
Indigenous peoples in NAN were appalled at these
actions, as they were contrary to policy statements
developed by conservation groups recognizing
the rights of Indigenous peoples to free, prior, and
informed consent. In the case of NAN and the World
Wildlife Fund of Canada (WWFC), one of the nine
(9) conservation organizations that supported the Act,
NAN pointed to the WWF Statement of Principles
on Conservation and Indigenous Peoples, and
the Conservation and Human Rights Framework,
both signed by WWFC. NAN accused WWFC of
violating their statement of principles on Indigenous
peoples’ rights, and issued a briefing note calling
for an investigation. NAN brought attention to the
fact that the actions of WWFC undermined the
legitimate aspirations of Indigenous peoples. NAN
also made it known that they expected WWFC to
honour its written policies and not push them aside
when convenient. The call for an investigation was
unheeded.
The Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement
During the development of the Far North Planning Initiative,
another top-down, national agreement was being negotiated in
secret. The signing of the Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement
(CBFA) in May 2010 is another example of ENGOs, in this
case in partnership with multinational forest companies
operating in the traditional territories of First Nations,
putting a large-scale conservation commitment ahead of local
Indigenous communities and their rights to make decisions
over their lands. Designed to protect woodland caribou habitat

and ensure ‘peace in the woods’ for the signatory forest
companies, the CBFA exacerbated divisions among First
Nations about approaches to conservation. Although apologies
were proffered by ENGO representatives for their failure to
consult First Nations, the signatory ENGOs claimed that the
CBFA would ultimately benefit First Nations. For example, the
David Suzuki Foundation claimed after the fact that for the
CBFA to succeed, Aboriginal people must be “fully involved,
supported, and receive tangible benefits from its conservation
and ecosystem-based forestry development” (David Suzuki
Foundation 2010).
The CBFA was announced by ‘nine leading environmental
organisations’ (Canadian Boreal Initiative, Canadian Parks
and Wilderness Society, Canopy, David Suzuki Foundation,
ForestEthics, Greenpeace, The Nature Conservancy, the Pew
Environment Group’s International Boreal Conservation
Campaign, and the Ivey Foundation) and 21 forest companies
represented by the Forest Products Association of Canada
(FPAC) (CBFA 2011). The Agreement contained an ambitious
set of commitments over a three-year period for the boreal
forest. These included: accelerating the completion of an
ecosystem-representative protected areas spaces network;
developing and accelerating implementation plans for species
at risk, with the priority being woodland caribou; implementing
sustainable forest management practices that reflect ecosystembased management; taking action on climate change; taking
action ‘to improve the prosperity of the Canadian forest sector
and the communities that depend on it’; and working ‘to
achieve recognition in the marketplace for the environmental
performance of the participating companies’ (CBFA 2010).
The agreement did acknowledge that Canada’s boreal
forests are ‘uniquely important to Aboriginal peoples and
are a vital part of the cultural, spiritual, economic and social
relationships between Aboriginal communities and their
traditional lands.’ Commitments were included to use the
‘best available information’, including ‘Aboriginal traditional
knowledge’ and to permit ‘traditional Aboriginal activities’ to
take place in protected areas. Most importantly, the signatories
recognised that:
	Aboriginal peoples have constitutionally protected
Aboriginal and treaty rights and title as well as
legitimate interests and aspirations. The CBFA
is intended to be without prejudice to, and in
accordance with, those rights and title. FPAC, FPAC
Members, and ENGOs believe both successful forest
conservation and business competitiveness require
effective involvement of Aboriginal peoples and
their governments. The signatories are committed
to such involvement taking place in a manner that
is respectful of and engages these Aboriginal rights,
title, interests, and aspirations.
The agreement received a mixed reaction among First
Nations. Those First Nations who were signatories to the
CBI supported the initiative, even though they had not been
involved in the CBFA negotiations. Other First Nations leaders,

especially in British Columbia, initially spoke out against their
exclusion from the Agreement. In response, in July 2010 David
Suzuki called a meeting of ‘Boreal Chiefs’ in Prince George, in
which he apologised on behalf of the David Suzuki Foundation,
a signatory to the CBFA. He explained:
	I do not believe it is right to launch an international
campaign to boycott boreal wood, to carry out
negotiations between ENGOs and forest companies,
and then to invite the First Nations of the boreal
to the negotiation table. None of this should have
been started without the complete involvement and
agreement of the First Nations to whom this forest
is not just resources, opportunity or commodities,
but first and foremost, your home, your history and
culture, and the future. The fate of the boreal has the
greatest implications for First Nations people and for
you to have been left out is egregious and wrong.
	I am here speaking as one person, but I am also a
co-founder of the David Suzuki Foundation which
signed to support the CBFA very late when the
boycott and negotiations were well underway. I
and the foundation did not do our due diligence to
realize that First Nations weren’t involved and I am
ashamed that we supported this agreement without
first rectifying this omission. I cannot and do not
speak for the other signators of the Canadian Boreal
Initiative, but I want to make my position very
clear. I am here to offer my sincerest apology for
the disrespect shown by the failure to include boreal
First Nations in this process and by the failure of the
David Suzuki Foundation to recognize and correct
this egregious mistake. I am truly sorry.
	It is my hope that the boreal First Nations will find
the generosity to accept the apology so that we can
get this process, however belatedly, onto the right
track because I believe the CBFA offers an enormous
opportunity to First Nations of the boreal.... But a
deal has been struck, trumpets sounded and the media
reported. It would be tragic if what has been achieved
were to be discarded to begin again. If we can put
the train on the tracks, acknowledge our grievous
error, the First Nations can take advantage of a huge
opportunity.
An apology was also offered by Larry Innes, Executive
Director of the Canadian Boreal Initiative. For some First
Nations, especially those in British Columbia, who had worked
closely with ENGOs like the David Suzuki Foundation, these
apologies were sufficient. Suzuki’s apology was sweetened by
an offer by the Suzuki Foundation and CBI to fund a meeting in
Prince George, first billed as a ‘national’ meeting, but boycotted
by First Nations in eastern Canada.
The Prince George meeting was held in October 2010 and
sponsored by the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and the British
Columbia First Nations Energy and Mining Council (CSTC
2010). A draft discussion paper First Nations peoples and the

future of the boreal was prepared outlining several strategies
for moving forward: 1) support for a draft Indigenous Boreal
Declaration; 2) creation of a national First Nation boreal
entity; 3) creation of a First Nation Boreal Secretariat; 4) the
development of regional action plans; 5) the development
of template protocols between First Nations, ENGOs and
industry; and 6) continued regional discussions. The draft
Indigenous Boreal Declaration committed signatory First
Nations to ensure that Aboriginal rights are upheld, and that
free, prior, and informed consent is obtained before enacting
policies and legislation that affect those rights. The draft
Declaration also called for sharing knowledge and resources
with others who support the Declaration, and acknowledging
‘our rightful role as governments in determining the protection
and use of the resources from the Boreal region’ (Anonymous
2010: 23-24). These recommendations were not widely
adopted and little mention of them can now be found, perhaps
because there was not widespread agreement among First
Nations about this strategic approach.
Several of the strategies outlined in the draft discussion paper
were discussed at a national meeting called by the Assembly of
First Nations (AFN) in March 2011. At its Special Assembly
in December 2010, the AFN passed a resolution on the CBFA
calling for a national meeting of First Nations to discuss policy
on boreal forests within their traditional territories, including
jurisdiction, climate change and carbon markets, forest tenure,
biodiversity, and traditional uses. The AFN condemned the
‘disrespectful manner’ in which the CBFA had been negotiated
by ENGOs and FPAC companies and called for its termination,
as well as affirming the principle of free, prior, and informed
consent for any decisions on conservation, management, and
development of the boreal forest. Also recommended was
collaboration between First Nations and AFN on monitoring
developments in the boreal forest, and a review and analysis of
the impact the CBFA on First Nations (AFN 2010). Participants
at the meeting failed to reach consensus on how to proceed, and
there was no consensus reached on calling for the cancellation
of the CBFA. Those who had attended the Prince George
meeting were more conciliatory, taking the position the ENGOs
had apologised and it was ‘time to move on.’
The ‘time to move on’ sentiment was echoed in an open
letter by Stephen Kakfwi of the Northwest Territories, one
of the CBFA supporters and consultant to the CBI and other
ENGOs. Kakfwi, in an editorial titled It’s time to forgive and
move forward, acknowledged that the CBFA was flawed and
disrespected First Nations leadership, but the ENGO apology
should be accepted and alliances built (Kakfwi 2011). Grand
Chief Stan Beardy of NAN disagreed:
	The key difference between the position of the
49 First Nations of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation and
the commentary of Mr. Kakfwi appears to be whether
an apology can effectively address the profound
wrong and the fundamental disrespect of First Nations
leadership, governments and authority represented
by the notion that conservation organizations and

to ask a new question: What might post-colonial
conservation look like in the boreal forest? How do
we reconcile Aboriginal goals for self-determination
and sustainable northern communities with those of
internationally-funded conservation actors and their
campaigns and forest companies engaged in a highly
competitive global marketplace? Are the goals of
ENGOs and forest companies, reflected in the CBFA,
compatible with Aboriginal goals?

forest companies have any independent capacity
whatever to arrive at private agreements which
purportedly affect the use, planning, management
and protection of First Nation lands. Ultimately, it
is about meaningful recognition of, and respect for,
the sovereignty, authority and stewardship of First
Nations within our homelands. (Beardy 2011)
NAN and others such as Ovide Mercredi, former Chief of
his community, the Misipawistik Cree Nation in Manitoba,
and former National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations,
and Chief Harry St. Denis, former Chief of Wolf Lake First
Nation, an Algonquin community in Quebec (profiled in Van
Schie and Haider This issue), continue to oppose the CBFA.
Thus, another outcome of the CBI and CBFA was to exacerbate
divisions among First Nations.
DISCUSSION:
TRANSFORMING ENGO/INDUSTRY PRACTICE
TOWARD FIRST NATIONS
Both the Canadian Boreal Forest Framework and the
Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement, as well as earlier
ENGO/industry/government deals such as Ontario’s Forest
Accord, have led to sustained national and international
pressure on Ontario and other provincial governments to pass
new policies to meet the 50% protected areas target and to
focus on the protection of caribou habitat. While there may
be merit in protecting a threatened species like caribou, the
lack of First Nations involvement in the strategies to do so
has caused divisions among First Nations, failed to consider
First Nations views, and ignored constitutionally-protected
Aboriginal and treaty rights. In a series of articles to the
IUCN’s Commission on Environmental, Economic and Social
Policy (CEESP), Davidson-Hunt et al. (2010) explored some
of the implications of the exclusion of First Nations, pointing
out the need to examine the impacts of top-down decisions
by international ENGOs and the private sector on local
communities to ensure ‘resulting policies are not contributing
to the further impoverishment of local communities and their
exclusion from decision-making’. Burlando et al. (2011) in a
subsequent article pointed out that:
	Global actors have chosen to position the boreal
as a “battleground” between conservation and
development with the classic justification that the
end justifies the means. However, what is lost when
conservation and development are moved forward
without adequate participation of First Nations in
decision-making? Many First Nation leaders view the
Far North Act and CBFA as contemporary examples
of colonial policy-making processes, often seen as
good “for them,” yet made without their participation.
Given that the debate among First Nation leaders, and
now some ENGOs and forest companies, about the
merits of the top-down deal-making appears to be
intensifying, perhaps it is time for some of the actors

The authors called for the creation of a space for First
Nations that would focus on ‘a broader dialogue about
self-determination, conservation and development in the boreal
forest.’ However, other than the AFN national meeting held
in 2010, there has been little discussion with the Indigenous
community and a lack of dialogue of with ENGOs about
strategies to ‘protect’ the boreal forest.
ENGOs have taken some positive steps to transform
their relationships with First Nations, attempting to form
partnerships in conservations efforts. However, the relationship
is still narrowly confined to those communities that are opposed
to development. These relationships are subject to rupture when
First Nations insist on taking a leadership role that would place
the ENGO agenda in a subsidiary role. If space is created for
First Nations, then perhaps ENGOs, industry and government
might have an opportunity to explore new and alternative
approaches to conservation and development.
CONCLUSION
The problem of First Nations’ involvement in natural
resource management and conservation will persist as long
as First Nations continue to insist that their rights in relation
to lands and resources be recognised. The ‘Indian problem’
(Cairns 2001: 17) in natural resources is at its core about
finding a way to reconcile the conflicting goals of the state
and First Nations. The conflict lies in the state assuming
control of natural resource management and conservation
without addressing Aboriginal and treaty rights. The path
to reconciliation is implementation of Aboriginal and treaty
rights by the state in its natural resource regimes. As such, any
groups seeking to promote changes in provincial management
regimes, whether it be further natural resource extraction,
improved management, or increased ‘protection’, should also
be considering Aboriginal and treaty rights in their strategies,
especially the principle of free, prior and informed consent.
Such an approach has the potential to open up new avenues for
conservation and development, rather than relying on colonial
approaches where both governments and other stakeholders
(ENGOs and industry) decide that they know what is best for
First Nations.

federal lands or ‘reserves’ were set aside for their use and

who have constitutionally-recognised rights to lands beyond
these reserves. The term ‘Aboriginal’ is used when it refers
to constitutionally protected Aboriginal and treaty rights,
Aboriginal being defined in the Constitution Act, 1982 as
‘Indians, Inuit and Métis’. ‘Indigenous’ is the accepted term
used in the international arena.

Note that it is 80% of First Nations communities (or reserves)
that are located within the commercial forest zone, often
misquoted as 80% of the First Nations population. Statistics
Canada found in the 2001 Census that just over half of the
Aboriginal population lived on reserves or in rural non-reserve
areas, including the Far North. The other half lived in urban areas
(Statistics Canada 2008). The 2006 Census showed that 54% of
the Aboriginal population (totalling 1,172,785 people or 3.8%
of the Canadian population) resided in urban areas (HRSDC
2011).

federally-owned reserve lands governed under the Indian Act,

in Ontario, the failure of governments to live up to the terms of
the treaty, and First Nations views of the treaties.
