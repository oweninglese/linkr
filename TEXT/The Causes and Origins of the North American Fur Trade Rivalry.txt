The Company's financial crisis of 1809-1810 brought about by the decline in
demand due to the Napoleonic Wars shocked it out of complacency and into
aggressive competition.

r HE North America fur-trading industry existed for almost two
hundred years, from the mid-seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth
century. During these two centuries the fur trade was the driving force
behind the geographical expansion of the economy from the St. Lawrence Basin to the Pacific Ocean, creating a lasting communications
network for the region.
The industry had for most of its existence two distinct branches. One
branch was operated from the shores of Hudson Bay by a company
commonly known as the Hudson's Bay Company. The other branch,

the St. Lawrence Basin and Montreal, was under French control until
1764, and then, under control of British, mainly Scottish, merchants,
was conducted by an ever decreasing number of firms. In 1804 the two
remaining Montreal firms merged into the Northwest Company. After

1804, then, the North American fur trade was a duopoly. The duopoly
lasted for seventeen years, until the union of the two in 1821.

The years 1804 to 1821 were a crucial period in the development of the
Hudson's Bay Company, and saw the end of the fur trade as an

important actor in the development of Montreal. With the merger of the
two companies in 1821 the center of the fur trade moved from the St.
Lawrence Basin to the shores of Hudson Bay, although at the beginning
Hudson's Bay was the smaller company.

Commentators on the relationship between the two companies in the
period normally assume that the competition between them was highly

aggressive. The belief can be seen very clearly in E. E. Rich's The Fur
Trade and the Northwest to 1857: "the fur trade was ravaged by the
most uncompromising hostility in the whole history of that adventurous

business.' Other authors refer to the "severity of the struggle" and the
"acute competition" after 1804.2 I will show that on the contrary from
1804 to 1810 the relationship is better described as passive rather than

aggressive. Further, I will show how changes in the European market,
specifically the fall in demand for furs as a result of the Napoleonic
wars, led to a breakdown in this passive relationship. The breakdown

occurred primarily as a result of the severe financial crisis that the
Hudson's Bay Company faced in 1809-1810, generated to a large extent

by the loss of the European markets and by the increases caused by the
war in the prices of provisions and stores for the North American trade;

it was exaggerated further by the Company's policy within the North
American market.
INTERFIRM BEHAVIOR, 1804 TO 1810

This picture of the allegedly hostile relationship between Northwest
Company (NWC) and Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) is given its
clearest statement by Frederick Merk:
For fifteen years the NWC and the HBC clashed in the forests of Rupert's Land. It was

a bitter war in which each party wielded weapons of trade and of violence mercilessly in
turn. Rival posts fought each other at close range; there was under-cutting and over-

bidding; . . . From the arsenal of war were drawn raids, the levelling of each other's
trading posts, incitation of the Indians and half-breeds to violence, open fighting and
secret stabbing and shooting in the shadows of the forest.3

The attitude of Hudson's Bay toward its competitor as documented in
the annual letters sent by the committee in London to its men at the Bay
was quite different from that portrayed by Merk. With the merger of the
remaining Montreal traders into the rival company the committee wrote

informing its servants that they were to "maintain the utmost peace and
harmony with their opponents; it is not the intention nor the interest of
this company to create contentions either with the natives or with the
Canadians."4 Again in 1806 the committee wrote that its men "were to
avoid any discussion or disagreement with those people" but to
"maintain the utmost peace and harmony with your opponents."5 In

1808, the men were reminded to stay "on as peaceable terms as possible
with your opponents."6 Thus throughout the whole period from 1804 to
1810 the policy of Hudson's Bay was not one of aggression but one of
maintaining peace and harmony with the Northwest Company. The
Hudson's Bay committee, in fact, believed in a "steady perseverance in
pursuing the business"7 because "our articles of trade will from their
superior quality command a preference" and will then "ensure you a
decided superiority. "8
The evidence on the Hudson's Bay Company's attitude in the period
before 1810 comes from the company's committee meeting minutes and
correspondence with its traders in Hudson Bay; the same quality or
quantity of evidence does not exist for the other company. Although
minutes for several of the Northwest Company's annual meetings still
exist, the evidence on the company's attitude during these years comes
mainly from the diaries and journals of partners and traders, and in part
from the rationality of following a predatory form of behavior after 1804.
It can be argued that the Northwest Company prior to 1804 had engaged
in predatory competition with the other Montreal firm, the XYC (that is,
Sir Alexander McKenzie and Company); when the struggle ended in
1804, one might argue (as has Morton) that it tried to take over
Hudson's Bay in the same manner.9 But in the earlier struggle the old
Northwest Company had in fact failed to push the XYC out of the
market, ending the struggle with a merger between equals. Predatory
competition is very expensive. That the companies merged can be taken
as evidence either that they were becoming financially exhausted or that
they realized that predation was not going to work. Both suggest that it
would not have been rational for the companies to continue such
behavior against the Hudson's Bay Company. The argument that the
competition between the Northwest Company and the Hudson's Bay

Company was not predatory is further strengthened by the diaries and
journals of such Northwest men as Daniel Harmon, who spent sixteen
years from 1800 west of Lake Superior, and Alexander Henry, a
Northwest partner. 10 They wrote at length about the good relations
existed between the companies. Harmon in fact wrote "the greater part
of the Northwest and Hudson's Bay people live on amicable terms; and
when one can with propriety render a service to the other it is done with
cheerfulness. " 11

In short, the relationship between the two companies was not
predatory. This is not to imply that no aggressive behavior occurred at
all, but rather that when it did occur it was the result of local conditions
and personalities rather than general policy of the companies. Although
the Hudson's Bay Company's minutes mention aggressive behavior on
the part of certain Northwest traders, the incidents are few in number.

The Northwest traders similarly comment on the occasional aggressive
actions of the Hudson's Bay men in their areas. Alexander Henry wrote
that there were "many reports circulating to the prejudice of Mr.
Hughes and myself, supposed to be due to my neighbour's art of
detraction to which I am sorry to find him much addicted."12
If the relationship between the two cannot be characterized as
predatory, neither can it be characterized as a strategy of joint profit

maximization. In fact, an attempt at a collusive agreement failed. In
1804, just after the merger of the Montreal firms, the Northwest

Company proposed to its rival that the Hudson's Bay Company allow
them a transportation route to the Bay and storage facilities there. In
return for such facilities the Northwest Company was willing to pay an

annual sum of ?2000 and leave all its posts in the Moose and Eastmain
areas. 13 The Hudson's Bay committee realized "that it would be advantageous for all concerned in the fur trade if some regulation can be made

with the Canadian company or companies. "14 But there were problems
for the Hudson's Bay Company in such an agreement. One of them can
be seen in the remark just quoted: the committee spoke of the
"Canadian company or companies" because it was not certain about
the nature of the firm it faced. In a similar vein the committee was
worried about the security of collateral that the Northwest Company
would put up and the possibility of further entrants to the market. In a
letter to the Northwest Company negotiators the committee wrote
... we must therefore be allowed to enquire how far we may be secured from the
encroachment of succeeding traders who may disavow the acts of their predecessors,
and although enjoying all the benefits resulting from the completion of the present
negotiations, and we expect that in addition to that satisfactory explanation, you will
again offer in such collateral security that will ensure to us those advantages which it is

your intention to offer in compensation for those facilities in prosecuting your trade;

which must manifestly operate so much to our disadvantage.'5

The main stumbling block, however, was a restriction the Hudson's
Bay Company wished to impose. The committee informed the Northwest Company that "you must be aware that we are of course restrained

North American Fur Trade Rivalry 781
to carry on our trade exclusively with Great Britain, it will therefore be
a necessary consequence of our treaty that you should confine yourself
to the same restriction." 16The restriction was quite unacceptable to the
Northwest Company, which at that time was attempting to ship furs to

China, selling furs to Astor for the American market, and sending furs in
American ships directly to the Baltic.

At the local level the Hudson's Bay committee was not dead set
against agreements between traders, but it insisted on being informed
and on the whole discouraged them. The failure of the two companies to
reach a collusive agreement meant, of course, that profits were lower
for both companies than if the two firms had colluded to maximize joint
profits. This was of significance for the Hudson's Bay Company in that
the lower profit exacerbated the financial crisis of 1809-1810.
Thus, for the years 1804 to 1810, the behavior of the Hudson's Bay
Company and the Northwest Company was neither predatory nor
collusive. The Hudson's Bay policy was to remain "on as peaceable
terms as possible" with its competitor. The companies coexisted
peacefully but did not collude.
THE EUROPEAN MARKET

The role of the European markets is one that has been particularly
neglected in most of the literature on the fur trade, and particularly on
the Hudson's Bay Company. Little is known about either the structure

of the Continental market in the years prior to the European Blockade
or the magnitude of the fall in demand faced by the companies as a result
of the Napoleonic Wars. E. E. Rich is one of the few authors to mention
that the Hudson's Bay Company did indeed sell a high proportion of
certain furs and skins destined for resale at the major European fairs of
Leipzig, Frankfurt, and St. Petersburg. From the Hudson's Bay minutes for the years prior to 1806 it is evident that the committee felt that
its European buyers were very important customers. The minutes
report quite frequently that the scheduled sales had to be postponed

because of "the lateness of the foreign mails."'17
The Continental Blockade was not formally introduced by Napoleon
until 1806. It is clear, however, that the European market was being
disrupted as early as 1804. Table 1 gives the numbers of furs exported
from England to Europe in each year from 1800 to 1808. By 1808 the
numbers of all furs exported had declined dramatically, and a year
earlier the decline had begun. The numbers in parentheses below the
1807 export figures show that year's exports as a percentage of the 1800
16 Ibid., para. 40. The Committee was informing the NWC agents that since it was required by a
Navigation Act clause in its charter to sell its furs only on the English market, the NWC would have
to be bound also by the same clause.

level. Deer, fox, otter, and raccoon declined by 50 percent; bear,
beaver, and mink declined 75 percent; the remaining furs declined by at
least 90 percent.

The Napoleonic Wars not only cut the numbers of furs exported from
Great Britain to Europe but also shifted the markets for which these furs
were destined. From 1804 there was a move in the main market area
from the center of Europe to the periphery (such as to Heligoland-a

British colony-and Sweden). Other areas in Europe were also affected
by the Blockade. Prussia and Russia received furs from Great Britain.
Prussia, however, appeared to have been a proxy market for all of
"Germany." Russia, on the other hand, was a legitimate market for
British furs, consistently purchasing beaver and other skins in every
year until 1808, and was in fact the main market for beaver.
The official values of British furs exported, listed in Table 2 for the
years 1800 to 1811, do not denote the market value of the goods in
question, but they do give us an idea of the relative changes at fixed

prices that occurred. The official value of skins exported, taking a five

year average from 1802 to 1806, was ?67,000, while the average for the
years 1807 to 1811 was ?23,000, a decrease of almost 70 percent. In
short, both the actual figures for furs exports and the official value
figures show a decline of over 50 percent by 1808. Table 2 suggests that
the decreased demand continued down to 1814.

The surviving sales records for the years 1807 and 1808 show that

these years were extremely bad sales years for the company.'8 Table 3
describes the quantities of undamaged skins sold at the Hudson's Bay
auctions in 1808, comparing that year to 1800. In 1808 the company sold
only some deer and bear skins, apart from its sale of beaver. It is clear
that the Hudson's Bay Company was directly affected by the fall in
European demand that resulted from the Napoleonic Wars and the

Continental System.

FINANCIAL STATUS OF THE COMPANIES
Hudson's Bay Company

To show why the Hudson's Bay Company was faced with a financial
crisis in 1809-1810 it is necessary to explain how the Company normally
operated. The most basic feature of its financial operation was its lack of
ready cash, resulting from the lumpiness of its transactions. Trade
goods had to be purchased late in December and early in the new year
for the following year's trade, whereas the fur sales were held from late
January to late April. As a result, the Company held very little excess

cash, financing the purchase of trade goods with a ? 10,000-?20,000
overdraft facility with the Bank of England, the Company's banker.

During the winter months the Company would borrow against the
facility and repay it as receipts arrived from the sales. The receipts were
spread over much of the year, and even in normal years one can see the

Company being paid in May or June for furs sold in a January sale.
While this was the normal operating policy, the Company's asset
position from 1804 of ?134,950 appeared ample to secure its overdraft
with the Bank of England.'9
The Hudson's Bay Company sales revenue figures are given in Table

4 and cash balances in Tables 5 and 6. The strain on the company arising
from the very poor years in 1807 and 1808 can be seen in the cash

balance sheets. As pointed out, the overdraft facilities with the Bank of
England were normally used only during the winter months, which was
the case for 1804 through 1806. The far smaller sales revenue for 1807
had an immediate impact on the cash position. Not only did the
company use its overdraft facilities during the winter months, but it

remained in debt for practically the whole year, with the liquidity
problem becoming most acute during the summer. By then the company

had reached its overdraft limit even before it had purchased its trade
goods for the following year. Consequently, the company asked the
Bank of England to extend its overdraft by a further ?30,000, increasing

its borrowing limit to ?50,000, to which the Bank of England agreed.20
The following year was also bad. Although the cash balance position
improved substantially for some months, the company still had made

use of the full ?50,000 overdraft limit by December. During 1808, the

asset position of the Company deteriorated, with the sale of all funded
property, annuities, and consols on a poor market.21 In September the
Company changed its relationship with the Bank of England, employing
Lefevre as its private bankers and leaving the Bank of England as
strictly a lender. Although 1809 was a very good year, with the
Company receiving ?72,343 from its fur sales (more than the two
previous years combined), the Company's position by December of
1809 had not greatly improved. The Company still owed the Bank of
England ?40,000 and had a positive balance with its bankers of only
?1,733. The increased revenue from furs had been offset by the effect of
wartime inflation on the price of trade goods the Company had to
purchase in England. Over the four-year period 1803-1804 to 1808-1809
the cost of the Company's provisions rose by over 60 percent. The warinduced increases in prices faced by the Company were greater than the
average increase of British commodity prices, which was only 29
percent.22
By 1809 the extent of the Company's problems led it to appeal to the
Treasury for assistance in the form of a loan of ?60,000 and a

postponement of the duties owed on its imports of furs and skins into
England. The Company explained that as a result of the war it had lost
considerable revenue and, furthermore, that it had pledged its credit to
the limit with all sources.23 The Treasury replied that although it could
not lend money without an Act of Parliament it would extend the time
period for the payment of import duties for a further twelve months.

Thus by 1809-1810 the Company was faced with serious financial
problems. Its normal operating procedures had meant that any decrease
in demand leading to a fall in sales revenue, even for a relatively short
period of time, resulted in the Company having to fall back on further
credit or on sale of those assets that it had previously used as collateral
for the credit. The financial problems were exacerbated further by warinduced increases in the price of goods. The Company therefore
undertook a complete reorganization of its management and trading
methods, as we shall see.

23 This would seem to suggest that the Company was facing very real financial problems and
may be part of the reason why they moved to a private banking company and away from the Bank
of England. The Company also obtained short-term cash from its committee members on which it

paid 5 percent. Minute Book examples of some such short-term borrowing are for 1809: 11th
January 1809-"Received ?1,000 from Thomas Langley esq., for use of the Company." 15th
February 1809-"Received from William Mainwaring, ?1193.7.0 for use of Company." 23rd
August 1809-"Secretary borrowed on 14th Inst. of William Mainwaring ?500."

Northwest Company
The Northwest Company did not suffer as severe a financial strain as
did the Hudson's Bay Company. The unequal impact of the fall in
demand can be attributed to two main factors. As has been noted
already, the Northwest Company had diversified its markets, and was
not tied solely to the English market. In 1804 and 1805 the Company
shipped furs directly from Quebec to Hamburg using American ships.24
In 1808, it secured "a saving price for otters and 23,000 martens" by

selling them to Astor, "with a view to relieve the London market," as
was the shipment of ?9,000 worth of furs to the United States for sale.25
The second major factor operating in favor of the Northwest Company was its ability to change the relative prices it paid for furs to match

the demand conditions in its foreign markets. The Hudson's Bay

Company's inability or unwillingness to change relative prices, as I
argue below, contributed further to the financial crisis of 1809-1810. By
contrast, as a result of its pricing strategy in the North American market

the Northwest Company was able to obtain the furs (especially beaver)
that still sold on the English market. The letters sent from Sir Alexander
McKenzie and Company to Inglis, Ellice and Company comment on
this fact, tying the good returns of that company to the price of beaver
on the English market. In 1807 they wrote "we are happy to remark that

our returns have been most ample and promise greater profits on the
business of the year, allowing that your favourable report respecting
Beaver is realized," and this was in spite of "tardy and mutilated
sales."26 Again in 1808, in other letters between these two companies,
Alexander McKenzie and Company wrote "...on the subject of furs we
regret the low state of the market and unfortunately see little
prospect of a speedy change in their favour.... Still, let Beaver continue
to bear a good price and we shall make a handsome profit on the

business of the year."27 In fact beaver prices remained very high until

There were a few other minor reasons for the good performance of the
Northwest Company. It was in a position to secure some of its
provisions and trade goods in markets other than the British, buying

provisions in both Montreal and Detroit: fine flour sold for 15 shillings a

hundredweight in Montreal, 21.5 shillings in London. Thus, it did not
face to the same extent the increase in prices and the higher transporta24 Minute Book, Minutes of Transactions, Reel 18.

tion costs that faced the Hudson's Bay Company. Further, the Northwest Company was able to store furs whose prices had fallen; in 1808
the Northwest Company put 1,100 fine bear skins in storage.29
HUDSON's BAY COMPANY BEHAVIOR 1804-1810

The Hudson's Bay committee meetings and letters to the officers at
the Bay indicate a clear awareness of the impact of the Napoleonic

Wars. In a letter written in 1808 to the Treasury asking for a deferral of
import duties the Company stated that the reason for the request was
"the difficulties the Company labours under on account of the nonex-

portation of their furs to the Continent."30 This can be seen again in the
letter of May 1809 asking the Lords of the Treasury for a ?60,000 loan,
again on account of the "total interruption of all exportation to the north

of Europe.' '31 The committee understood that demand on the European
markets had fallen close to zero. In such a situation the reaction of the

Company should have been to decrease its output to a new lower
optimal level.

The Company's actual response to the European situation, however,
was not to attempt to decrease the quantity of furs imported into

England but rather to try to change the composition of imports. The
committee "resolved that every exertion should be used to promote as
much as possible the importation of those articles which meet a ready

sale for home consumption."32 The policy of attempting to change the
composition of the Company's output rather than its level implies that
the Hudson's Bay committee perceived the elasticity of demand for

those furs as high.33 The Company ordered its chief factors to change
the composition of their output but did not allow them to change the
relative prices of the furs to the Indians, forcing its traders to work with
a policy of moral suasion. In particular the committee wanted to
increase its supply of beaver, which was, as noted earlier, the only fur

that still sold for a good price on the English market. In 1807 the

committee wrote that as "?this [beaver] always commands a sure

certain sale," they were to obtain as much as possible.34 Again in 180
the factors were informed that as beaver prices had increased considera-

bly "they should get as much of it and as good quality as possible."35
Yet at no point did the Company consider either decreasing the quantity

33 It is difficult to measure the elasticity because of the lack of information concerning the
quantities of furs sold on the English market by the Northwest Company and the lack of precise
data on income levels in the United Kingdom and Europe for these years.

of furs exported from the Bay or changing relative prices. Many
authors, such as E. E. Rich, have praised the Company for its ability to
keep its level of output at the old levels. But the inability to adjust
output in an optimal fashion would further lower profits.
The committee did not allow their chief factors much independence in

setting prices. In 1804 the committee wrote to William Auld stating that
"we disapprove of altering the standard for bears" and informing him

that he did not understand the full ramifications of a price change.36 In
1807 the Company was still committed to its given standard or prices, as
it wrote in its annual letter:
We conceive that it may hurt the general trade in some respects to alter the standard so
long established with the Indians but we hope you are at liberty to reject and discourage
trading in furs or skins in which we lose very considerably... We must however, be
satisfied to take the bad with the good.37

The policy had perverse effects. Instead of changing the composition
of furs in favor of those skins that sold for English home consumption it
increased the quantity of what were essentially useless skins. As
Alexander Henry noted in his journal, in 1808, "they [the Blackfeet]
brought in wolves, but I sent them to my neighbours [the Hudson's Bay
Company] as wolves were not in season."38 So the Northwest Company was in fact using the Hudson's Bay Company as a sink for furs it was
not purchasing. The perverse effect of the Company's moral suasion
policy is commented upon further by Colin Robertson, who wrote: "As
to your standard by which your accounts are at present settled in the
interior it is so prejudicial to your interest that a stranger would be apt to
conclude ... that wolves' skins and Parchment were the only articles in
demand in London, while the Beaver and the Musk-Rat were of little or
no value."39 As can be seen in Table 7, the Company's policy did not

lead to any shifts out of wolves, mink, and martens into beaver.'"
By 1808 the committee decided that at least some prices must be
changed, basically those for cats, wolves, rabbits, and kitt foxes. But
this was only a very limited change; the Company still relied on its
"moral suasion" policy. The following year the committee wrote a
letter to its traders that shows the company realized it had to alter its
policy (recall that by 1809 the Hudson's Bay Company was in a poor

financial position, having a ?50,000 debt with the Bank of England and
no annuities or consols). The letter read:
We expect by the return of our ships signed by the chiefs and all the Inland traders, a

distinct account of all the goods are really traded with the natives as well as the real
standard on which they are bartered, which will enable us to make those alterations we
may find necessary in the Standard of our Trade.4'

Again in the 1809 letter the committee expressly asked the factors to
store at the Bay any skins that would not sell in England, because any
skins that were imported into England were assessed for import duty,
payment of which the company could postpone only for twelve months
(or a little more under the special agreement). After the postponement
the Company was forced to put the skins up for sale, as in 1809, when it
had to "expose to sale the importation of 1806 to save the drawback of
the duties on exportation and have scarcely obtained a price equal to
one-third of the cost."42 Thus the committee wrote:
Having still in our warehouses your last Consignments of Martens, Otters, Cat, Foxes,

Bears, Wolves, Wolverines, Mink, Raccoon, Deer and Elk, we desire you will retain all
the packages of the above mentioned unsaleable articles till another season.43

committee began to store the unsaleable furs on the Bay."

Two explanations may be given for the policy of price rigidity. The
first is the Company's perception of the decline in demand and of its
relationship with the Indians. The committee may have perceived the
fall in demand as being transitory and was prepared, therefore, to accept
the short-run losses from non-adjustment rather than, so to speak,

laying-off any of its Indians. The Company may have feared that when
demand increased again those same Indians might not have returned,
going to the Northwest Company instead.45 The Indians' attitude, the
Company believed, would have been that the Company had let them
down and could not be trusted. Indeed, it was just such an argument
that the Northwest Company used against the Hudson's Bay Company
when it first arrived in Athabasca, telling the Indians not to trade with
the Hudson's Bay Company because it was not to be trusted when it
said it was going to return to that area. The second explanation is that
the committee may have feared that if it lowered its level of output a
new firm would move into the vacated area. Just such a fear helped to
undo the 1804-1806 negotiations between the two companies.
The contrast between the policies followed by the Hudson's Bay
Company and the Northwest Company can be linked, perhaps, to the
histories of the companies. The Northwest Company grew out of the
highly competitive structure that existed from 1770 among the many
Montreal merchants and traders. The organization of the Company gave
all the partners, both the merchants in Montreal and the traders who
directed operations in the field, direct involvement in the formulation of
company policy. In comparison the Hudson's Bay Company had
evolved not only in relative isolation from competitive pressure but also
over a far longer period of time, from 1670. The result was a more rigid,
formal structure in which policy was directed essentially by the committee in London.
RETRENCHMENT AND AFTERMATH

For the Hudson's Bay Company, the major results of this financial
crisis were the changes in the structure and in the management of the
Company's trade, which became known as the Retrenchment System.
The system was brought into effect by Andrew Wedderburn (later
named Andrew Colvile) and was basically a compromise position
between two other plans introduced to save the company in 1809.
Committee member Andrew Wollanston proposed a move out of the fur
trade for a number of years. The company could, in the meantime, try to
establish a timber industry on the Bay, exploiting the high war demands.
Colin Robertson proposed another plan, namely that the company
4 This fits in with the Rich-Rotstein thesis on the importance for the fur trade of the alliance

should reorganize the factories on the Bay, putting the chief factors on
profit-sharing to increase their sense of competition, and that it increase

the number of men on the Bay, especially by hiring Canadians who
knew the interior and could effectively oppose the Northwest Company.

The chief factors would also be allowed far more discretion over what
prices they would pay the Indians for furs. Finally, the Company was to
expand its trade into the fur-rich areas of Athabasca and the Peace
River.46
The Colvile Retrenchment System took from Robertson the idea of
reorganizing the factories on the Bay. The chief factors were placed on a
profit-sharing scheme and the whole organization of the Bay trade was
tightened. No longer was each factory to operate on its own; rather, the

whole trading area was divided into a northern and southern department, each under a single superintendent. Unlike Robertson's plan,

however, the Colvile scheme did not initially propose any expansion of
the trade. Like Wollanston's plan, the Colvile plan emphasized that the
company should reorganize itself within the areas in which it now
operated. Colvile argued that it was "madness given the finances of the

Company to attempt such an enterprise [Athabasca] now. All hopes of
an Athabasca enterprise must be founded on the efficiency of the new
System under which the Company will operate.... Besides we shall be
more likely to succeed in a contest in Athabasca, when the home
territory of the Company is fully occupied, by numerous and powerful
establishments, conducted by active servants whose interests are

assimilated with those in the Company."47
The financial crisis of 1809-1810 can be viewed as a shock which
forced the Hudson's Bay Company to act in a manner more consistent
with profit-maximizing theories of behavior. Basically the committee
was determined to change its company's relative position in the industry
and to obtain a larger market share. The results over the following
eleven years can be outlined briefly. The committee's activities were
directed toward increasing the Hudson's Bay market share. The Company supported, for example, the development of the Red River
Settlement, which it saw as a solution to the manpower and provisioning
problems created by the Napoleonic Wars. It also pursued furs far more
vigorously. The more vigorous policy had been called for by the
Retrenchment System, but the resulting depletion of the animal stocks
intensified the company's activities. As a result of declining animal
stocks the Hudson's Bay Company finally in 1816 moved outside its
traditional trading areas into the Athabasca district.
While the Hudson's Bay Company was beginning to pursue its more
aggressive policy the Northwest Company was still trying to bring about

a collusive agreement. Negotiations in 1810-1811, of course, failed.
Eventually the Northwest Company began to see its rival's actions as

attempts to push it out of the trade entirely. It saw the Red River
Settlement in particular as a direct attempt to injure its competitive
position. The belief that the Hudson's Bay Company was trying to push
it out of the trade was further heightened by the methods used to obtain
furs, and finally confirmed by the Hudson's Bay move into the
Athabasca district, which for twenty years had been a Northwest area.
By 1816 the Hudson's Bay actions finally led the Northwest Company
to adopt a similarly aggressive strategy.

It was, then, during the next five years that the predatory competition
much discussed in the literature occurred. The origins and end of this

aggressive behavior are discussed in detail in my paper, "The Birth and
Death of Predatory Competition in the North American Fur Trade:

1810-1821"; the predation that occurred can be classified easily into
two main areas, psychological warfare-disruption of the trade-and
trading in the other firm's furs.48 The well-documented "kidnapping
business" was a method used especially by the Northwest Company to
disrupt its rival's trade. Of greater financial significance, however, was
the policy pursed by both companies of attempting to obtain furs
destined for and already paid for by the rival firm.
The predation was short-lived. In 1821, a complete union of the two
companies was achieved and the fur trading industry operated as a
monopoly. The merger was the result of financial and political factors.
By 1821 the aggressive competition of the previous five years was
exerting a severe financial strain on both companies. The exact timing

of the merger was a consequence of a set of events set in motion by
Angus Bethune and John McLaughin, both Northwest Company partners. These men, holding proxies for eighteen other Northwest partners, opened negotiations with the Hudson's Bay Company. Very

shortly thereafter the Northwest Company agents in London commenced negotiations on the part of the company itself. A merger

became the most likely outcome when the government offered to ratify
any outcome at which the negotiators arrived. Thus in 1821 the
Canadian fur trade became a monopoly concern operated by the new
Hudson's Bay Company.
