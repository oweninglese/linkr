Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The
Economics of Depletion in the Lands of
the Hudson's Bay Company, 1700-176
ANN M. CARLOS AND FRANK D. LEWIS
Indians depleted the beaver, yet we do not understand why. We analyzed the
pattern and determinants of beaver exploitation in the hinterlands of three
Hudson's Bay Company posts. Simulating beaver population, we found declining
beaver stock within each hinterland, but overharvesting in only two. Central to
this process was the Company reaction to French competition. Managers raised
prices in the Albany and York hinterlands, and in response the Indians increased
their harvests. Churchill, which did not experience French competition, had more
stable fur prices and showed no evidence of overexploitation of the beaver.

Exploration of the geographical area currently called Canada was

indirectly related to the expansion of the fur trade. Under the French
regime the search for ever-cheaper furs and for ways to bypass the
Indian middleman spurred exploration of the interior, as Europeans
traveled up the St. Lawrence, through the Great Lakes, and finally into
Lake Winnipeg and the Central Plains. The English trade began in 1670
when the Hudson's Bay Company was formed, and, although Company
traders sat at the Bay for over a century, they too eventually moved
inland. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, Canada embraced a
fur trading network from the St. Lawrence to the Pacific Ocean.
The advent of a commercial fur trade brought with it a change in the
relationship between Native Americans and the animal populations they
exploited. Now, animals were valued for more than food and clothing;
they were a source of European goods. The Indians responded to the

new opportunities, according to many historians, by overharvesting the
furbearers on which they depended, especially the beaver. Our article
addresses this issue of depletion. Specifically, we analyze the extent,
pattern, and determinants of beaver exploitation within the hinterlands
of three Hudson's Bay Company trading posts during the period 1700 to
1763 and ask whether the observed patterns can be explained in terms
of beaver population densities and the economic variables facing the

Indians. Before agreeing with historians who claim that Indian behavior
cannot be described by conventional economic analysis, we want to use
that analysis and see how far it takes us in accounting for their actions.

Our estimates of depletion are described by simulations of beaver
population in each hinterland. These are based on beaver returns from
each trading post, biological evidence on beaver population dynamics,
and contemporary estimates of beaver densities. As expected, the
introduction of a commercial trade led to a decline in beaver stocks, an

outcome that in itself does not imply excessive depletion but rather a

move to a lower but stable population level. We do find, however, that
in two of the three hinterlands in our study-those served by Fort
Albany and York Factory-there were further declines in population
caused by overharvesting, particularly in the latter part of the period.

Central to the overexploitation in the Albany and York hinterlands
was competition for furs between the English and French. In reaction to
a French presence in their areas, the managers of Hudson's Bay

Company trading posts raised the prices paid to the Indians for furs. The

Indians responded with increased harvests, and ultimately stocks declined. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the Indians' reaction to
price explains much of the fall in the beaver population and casts doubt

on the view that as prices rose the Native People reduced effort to

maintain a given consumption level. In fact, our results suggest that the

Indians clearly responded to higher prices by increasing supply.'
The contrast between the pattern of returns at the third trading
post-Fort Churchill-and the other posts is also revealing. Traders at
Fort Churchill did not face serious competition from the French, and

our simulation for that hinterland suggests that the interaction between
the Hudson's Bay Company and the Native People led to stable beaver
stocks that were close to the maximum sustained yield level.2 The
evidence from Fort Churchill reinforces our view that it was competition between European rivals and the Indians' reaction to the resulting
increase in the price they received for furs that led to overharvesting.

' The opposite view can be found in Ray, Indians and the Fur Trade, p. 68. He argued that the
impact of more favorable terms "did not induce them to bring more furs on a per-capita basis. In
fact, the reverse was the case."

2 This is the population that allows the largest annual harvest on a sustained basis.

Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay 467
DEPLETION AND THE FUR TRADE LITERATURE

That the Indians depleted the beaver is almost universally accepted.

But Canadian historians have widely varying interpretations of the
causes and extent of the depletion. Harold Innis pointed to sharp
declines in the beaver population that occurred very early on: "[by
1635] the beaver was rapidly worked out in the areas adjacent to the St.
Lawrence . . . and the supply of beaver was obtained to an increasing

extent from more remote areas."3 Indeed, the westerly drift of the
trade, according to Innis, was the "result of persistent trapping to meet

this demand [for European goods]."4 Innis, however, was more interested in the conduct of the European actors than in the Indians and said

little more on the matter of depletion. Treating the Indians as bit players
is clearly unsatisfactory, given it was they who hunted, trapped, and
traded the furs to the Europeans. E. E. Rich and later historians, among
them Arthur Ray, who investigated the Indians' role empirically, have
appropriately emphasized the importance of the Indians to the fur trade

and the impact of that trade on their way of life.5 But even Ray, who was
interested in the Indian as an economic agent, did not explicitly model
the Indians' behavior in relation to the animal stock.

The Indians' role has also been addressed in the ethnohistory
literature. One finds complete acceptance of the view that the Indians
depleted the resource, but there remains much debate about why this
occurred. Calvin Martin, in particular, has argued that "the Indian was
everywhere, except in the Rocky Mountain trade, the principal agent in
the overhunting of fur-bearing animals. This is undisputed. . . . It is
difficult to imagine how an individual whose subsistence economy was
underpinned by a reliance upon fish, game . . . could have been so
oblivious to wildlife dynamics as not to see that his recent course of

hunting was far too exploitive."6 Martin rejected a conventional economic interpretation of the depletion and suggested instead that we
must look for the answer within the Indians' own cultural view of the
trade. According to Martin, the only way the Indians could have
exterminated the resource base was "for the mutually courteous
relationship between man and animal to disintegrate before the Indian

could make war on his animal brethren."7 This hypothesis has received
much attention in the literature and has been seriously questioned. But
even though few ethnohistorians would agree fully with Martin's

analysis, generally they have accepted his assertion that the Indians

depleted animal stocks. Yet no clearly acceptable reason for the
Indians' behavior has been provided. Within this debate, there has been
little discussion of beaver population dynamics, the number of animals

harvested, the nature of property rights, the course of prices, or the role
of the English and French trading companies.
That property rights have a bearing on resource depletion is well
known. It is generally agreed, for example, that open access leads to

degradation, because it is in no one person's interest to conserve for the
future. With open access any individual's effort at conservation will
only leave more of the resource to others. It is also generally agreed that

this common property rights regime should be changed if the cost of

doing so is less than the benefit. Harold Demsetz argued that with the
advent of a commercial fur trade such a change occurred among the
Montagnais and the Naskapi tribes located in Northeastern Quebec and
Labrador. The new structure provided them with the incentive to
control their rate of exploitation.8 Bruce Trigger, however, has a

different view. He claimed that the Montagnais in Quebec exterminated
the beaver in an attempt to raise their living standard to the level of their
neighbors in the St. Lawrence Valley.9
Whether private property regimes are the solution to the problem of
overexploitation has been examined by David Feeny and others in a

series of papers.'0 They show that many different property rights
arrangements can be consistent both with overexploitation and with
competent management of a resource. This article takes as given the
property rights structure among the Indians and focuses instead on the
role played by the Hudson's Bay Company. As an important buyer of
furs, the Company was in a position through its pricing policy to prevent
overharvesting. Our results show, however, that they failed in two of
the three trading districts. Rather, as French competition increased in
these areas, the Company raised prices, and the Indians responded by
increasing the supply of furs to be traded. It was only in the Fort

Churchill hinterland, where the Hudson's Bay Company remained the
sole buyer and kept prices down, that beaver stocks remained near
maximum sustained yield levels.
A SHORT HISTORY OF THE FUR TRADE

A commercial fur trade grew from the interaction between Indians
and European fishermen. Under French rule the trade spread along the

St. Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers, but with little contact between
Europeans and the Indian hunters. Instead, Indian middlemen, in
particular the Hurons, dominated the trade and sought to protect their
position by hindering French exploration. The French, in turn, tried to

bypass these middleman traders with increasing success in the seventeenth century.11 It was in this environment of expanding French trade
that the Hudson's Bay Company was formed. 12 On receipt of its charter
in 1670, the Company quickly established several posts around James

Bay: Rupert's House on the eastern side, in 1671, followed in quick
succession by Fort Albany on the Albany River and Moose Factory on
the Moose and Abitibi Rivers (see Figure 1).13 Both of the latter posts
were rudimentary structures; nevertheless, the "newly established

Hudson's Bay Company began an immediate and effective competition

which was felt" as far south as the Great Lakes.14 Indeed, the
Governor, Charles Bayly, "assured the Committee that it [trade] would

be 'very extraordinary.' "15 Bayly, however, had underestimated the
speed of the French reaction. In 1686 they captured Fort Albany and
Rupert's House, and although both were returned in 1693, fur returns

for the Company's first 40 years were modest. 16
Despite the conflict and the uncertainty, the English company con-

tinued to expand its trading area around the Bay. In 1684 Port Nelson,
later renamed York Factory, was built on the Nelson River. A settlement was built even farther north on the Churchill River in 1689. But

even in these areas, the Company was not physically secure. 17 The
Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 brought an end to the military conflict between

British and French traders; the economic rivalry continued until the end

of French rule in 1763. Because of the military nature of the early years
of the Company's existence, our analysis focuses on the period from
1700 to the Treaty of Paris in 1763. Company policy in British North
America during these years was passive but vigilant.18 Traders waited
for the Indians to come to the Bay rather than actively going out in
pursuit of furs, and because each river-mouth fort commanded a
different hinterland, a roughly radial trading pattern developed.19 Such
a policy operated to the Company's advantage as long as the French did
not intercept the flow of furs. In contrast to the radial pattern of the
English trade, the trade from the St. Lawrence was linear, with
voyageurs continually pushing farther northwest and southwest in
search of new sources of supply.
On the surface, the organization of the two trades was similar. The
Hudson's Bay Company had a technical monopoly of the trade within
the drainage basin of Hudson Bay, and beginning in 1718, the Compagnie d'Occident was given a monopoly of the beaver trade farther south.
The English trade, however, was organized on strictly hierarchical
lines, whereas the French monopoly issued licenses congess) or leased
out the use of its posts. The leasing and licensing arrangements gave
those involved an incentive to extend the trade, so it is not surprising
that during the period after 1720, French traders infiltrated much of the
Great Lakes region. Movement farther west was postponed by the

17 Iberville threatened York Factory in 1690, captured it in 1694, and held it until 1714. Hence,
although there was a Hudson's Bay Company presence from 1670 to the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713,
the viability of its trading posts depended on the success of its military campaigns.

18 For the Hudson's Bay Company, these years are often referred to as the period of "sleep by
the frozen sea."

Indian Wars of 1727 to 1738, but beginning in the 1740s, new French
posts were established on Lake Winnipeg, Lac des Prairies, and Lake
Nipigon (see Figure 1). These posts represented a serious threat to the
flow of furs to York Factory.20
The Hudson's Bay Company, in contrast to the Compagnie d'Occi-

dent, attempted to set and maintain uniform rules for the managers of i
various forts. Although the head office allowed some divergence in
policy, the managers did not have great latitude in the conduct of the

trade. The Company dictated the prices managers could charge both for
trade goods and for furs. These standards were known as the Official
and Comparative Standards and were denominated in the Company's
unit of account-the Made Beaver.21 Because managers needed flexibility over price, however, the head office allowed some differences
between its posted schedules and those used in actual trade.22 The
difference between the actual revenue at each post (expressed in Made
Beaver) and the revenue implied by the Company standard was called
the overplus, for which the head office demanded a full accounting to
ensure that no manager was using the excess for personal gain.23 It is
within this highly centralized structure of the Hudson's Bay Company
and the more loosely coordinated French trade that our discussion of
depletion takes place.
ESTIMATING THE BEAVER POPULATION IN THE HUDSON BAY
DRAINAGE BASIN

Much of the fur trade literature is qualitative. Although data are
sometimes collected, they are often presented simply to illustrate a
point rather than to provide strong support for a particular hypothesis.
In some cases, the absence of quantitative analysis has not been
occasioned by a lack of available data. The Hudson's Bay Company
preserved its trading post records, and these records allow us to form a
good picture of some aspects of the fur trade, including the economic
relationship between the Indians and the Company. Arthur Ray and
Donald Freeman in their seminal works have already made use of these
data.24 We also employ the Company records but do so in order to
address the specific issue of depletion.
We analyzed fur returns from three Hudson's Bay Company trading
20 Ibid., chap. 5.
21 The best discussion of these standards and of the unit of account is to be found in Ray and
Freeman, "Give Us Good Measure," chaps. 6 and 9.

22 Rich has argued that the ceremonial nature of the trade was extremely important
included giftgiving, which required that traders have commodities and flexibility. Rich, "Trade
Habits."

23 The use of company accounts to monitor its managers is discussed in Carlos and Nichol
"Agency Problems," pp. 867-72.

posts to determine the trend in the beaver population from 1700 to 1763.25

Although the records show a wide variety of pelts were brought to the
posts-marten, wolf, bear, fox, moose, and other species-by far the

most important was beaver, which accounted for over 80 percent of the
value of furs traded. Each post reported annual returns on three

categories of beaver pelts: whole parchment, half parchment, and coat.
Both whole parchment and coat pelts sold for the same price, which was

also the unit of account, the Made Beaver.26 Half-parchment pelts were
from smaller animals or those trapped during the summer, and they sold

for one-half a Made Beaver. By summing over the three categories, we

obtained an estimate of the number of beaver killed by Indian trappers
and traded to the Hudson's Bay Company.27 These numbers provide the
basis of our beaver population estimates in each of the hinterlands.
The annual beaver harvest in the Fort Albany hinterland is reported
in Figure 2 and Table 1. This hinterland, shown on Figure 1, was roughly
600,000 square kilometers and included an area within about 100
kilometers of the coast where the Company faced no competition, as
stipulated by the Treaty of Utrecht. However, the region, consisting of
boreal forest, would only support low beaver densities. Farther south,
where the environment was more suitable and beaver densities were
very much higher, the Company faced substantial competition from

French traders, especially after 1720. The increasing French competi-

tion seems clearly to have influenced the magnitude of the English trade.
From 1700 to 1720, returns averaged 20,000, with wide year-to-year

fluctuations: the range was 15,000 to 30,000. After 1720 there was a
decline to an average of about 15,000. The returns remained fairly stable

until the late 1740s, when there were unusually large harvests, but

following these years, the trade fell precipitously to about 6,000 pelts.
25 We define the three trading areas as Fort Albany, York Factory, and Fort Churchill (see
Figure 1). Ray points out that the boundaries of the hinterlands are approximate and indeed may

have shifted from year to year depending on how aggressive were the managers of different posts.
Despite these limitations, we regard the hinterlands outlined by Ray as useful indicators of the

plausibility of our estimated beaver populations. See Ray, "Bayside Trade"; and Ray et al.,
"Rupert's Land."

26 Coat pelts were those worn by the Indians until the guard hairs fell out. They were then more
easily fashioned into felt and then hats.
27 The Company reported harvests in terms of its unit of account, the Made Beaver. We
converted these into numbers of pelts on the basis of the Company's Official Standard. Accordingly, the harvests of half-parchment beaver in terms of pelts is put at twice the harvest expressed
in Made Beaver. Whole parchment and coat beaver are not adjusted, reflecting the fact that they

each sold for one Made Beaver. Because coat beaver were worn for a period of time before being
sold and we wanted to determine the number of animals harvested each year, we set the harvest
of beaver eventually sold as coat beaver equal to the number of coat beaver traded the following
year. To illustrate: in 1736 York Factory reported trades of 15,375 whole parchment and 1,825 half
parchment beaver. Since these are reported in Made Beaver, the number of skins they represent

is set equal (with rounding) to 19,024 (15,375 + 2 x 1,825). In 1737, York Factory received 9,862

coat beaver. These are assumed to have been killed the previous season and worn for a year,
therefore the harvest for 1736 in the York factory hinterland is put at 28,886 (19,024 + 9,862)
beaver.

Returns were low through the 1760s, despite a modest recovery in the
early part of the decade.
The York Factory hinterland, at nearly one million square kilometers,
again shown on Figure 1, was roughly two-thirds greater than the area
served by Fort Albany, but a larger proportion of this hinterland was
boreal forest, again implying somewhat lower beaver densities. At the
same time, competition from the French, at least before 1740, was less
intense. Not surprisingly, returns at York Factory were much higher
(see Figure 2 and Table 1). After some small harvests very early on
(from 1717 to 1720), trade increased to nearly 37,000 pelts per year over
the decade of the 1720s and remained high during the 1730s when
returns averaged 33,000. During the period 1741 to 1749, the trade was
smaller by about 5,000 pelts per year, because of the emergence of
French competition, and even these smaller harvests could not be
sustained. From 1750 to 1763, an average of 18,000 pelts were traded,
representing a reduction of 10,000 below the harvests of the 1740s.
Fort Churchill was the post farthest west and north and, therefore,
was protected by distance from significant French competition. It

served a large hinterland (500,000 square kilometers), but, because of its
northerly location, the region consisted mainly of boreal forest with its

consequent low beaver densities. Trade volume in the early years was
very low, about 5,000 pelts from 1723 to 1727, but as the Fort became
established, trade expanded (see Figure 2 and Table 1). During the
1730s, returns averaged 11,000 per year. There was a modest decline in
harvests to about 9,000 in the 1750s, but in the 1760s volume returned to
the earlier levels. What distinguishes Fort Churchill from the other posts

is the comparative long-run stability of fur returns. The lack of French
trading in the region almost certainly accounts for part of the difference
in harvest patterns, but as we argue later, the absence of competition
may also have influenced Hudson's Bay Company strategy in exploiting
the beaver stocks.

The pattern of trade at any of the Company posts can, in principle, be

explained by a falling beaver population, a change in the intensity of
trapping by the Indians, a diversion of furs to the French, or some

combination of these changes. The problem is to disentangle the effects.

Consider the period 1740 to 1763 (see Figure 2). After averaging about
15,000 furs during the 1740s, the trade at Fort Albany in 1751 fell to
under 10,000, only the second time that had happened in 50 years. By
1755 the trade had declined a further 35 percent to about 6,000 furs. This
reduction in the Fort Albany harvest could presumably have been due
to any of the three causes we have mentioned; nevertheless, even the
limited evidence provides compelling support for the historical consensus that depletion did occur.
There were major epidemics among Indian tribes in the seventeenth
century, but none are reported for the eighteenth century. So despite the
lack of reliable population estimates, we have little reason to believe that
the number of trappers was falling dramatically during this period.28 The

decline in the Fort Albany harvest therefore resulted from either a
shrinking beaver population or some combination of reduced trapping

effort and the diversion of furs to the French. Quantitative information
on French harvests are scarce. In fact, Gratien Allaire has argued that
"il est impossible de constituer une sdrie statistique complete du volume

des entrees et des sorties du port de Qudbec."29 Although a complete
series cannot be generated, some data on French harvests are available.
It has been estimated, for example, that in 1755 the French received
about 6,000 beaver pelts from the Fort Albany hinterland, roughly the
same number as the Hudson's Bay Company.30 Even if the French in
1755 were receiving twice the average number of furs as in the 1740s, the

increase in French harvests would still account for only a small fraction
of the overall decline in the Hudson's Bay Company's returns.

If increased French harvests did not bring about the fall in returns at
Fort Albany, could decreased trapping effort by the Indians have been
the cause? Again, we cannot answer this issue directly, but the indirect

evidence clearly points to a declining beaver stock rather than declining
Indian effort. The Indians traded a wide variety of skins to the Hudson's
Bay Company: white and red fox, wolverine, wolf, bear, cat, and

muskrat. Other than beaver, however, by far the most important animal
traded was marten, whose price was held fixed at one-third Made

Beaver. Because the price was constant in terms of beaver, harvests of
marten and beaver should have moved together unless one of the
species was being depleted. In Table 2, we present the number of beaver
and marten brought to Fort Albany from 1740 to 1763. The correlation

coefficient of the two series is just .16, which suggests fluctuating
harvests were due to factors other than variable hunting effort.

The period from 1750 to 1755 is especially revealing. In 1751, the trade
in beaver declined sharply, and for the next two years harvests
remained at historically low levels. During the same period, the marten

harvest jumped to historic highs. In fact, the marten trade in 1753 was
more than double the 1740 to 1750 average. It seems apparent that
during the early 1750s, hunting effort was diverted from beaver to

marten, and because the relative prices of the two types of fur were
unchanged, a decline in the beaver stock seems clearly to have been the
cause. After 1753, the marten harvest also shrank to very low levels
providing further evidence of depletion. What emerges from the Fort

Albany data is a pattern where overharvesting of one species (the
beaver) in the late 1740s led to depletion in the early 1750s, which in turn

induced overharvesting of marten and the decline of that species as well.

are also suggestive of a declining beaver population. During the early
years, returns exhibit a pronounced sawtoothed pattern, but later on the
short-run variation is noticeably dampened (see Figure 2). This difference in harvest pattern has also been observed in Ontario during the
twentieth century, when estimates of beaver stocks are available. In

Ontario, it was only in the 1960s that the beaver population fully
recovered from the serious depletion of the 1930s. Throughout the years
of decline and recovery the harvests exhibit very small year-to-year
fluctuations, but beginning in the 1960s, there is a pronounced change in
the pattern. It becomes sawtoothed and very reminiscent of the Hud-

son's Bay Company experience during the early eighteenth century.31
The fur returns from Fort Albany are strongly suggestive of depletion,
but depletion was a force operating on the underlying population from
which these harvests were drawn. In order to describe more fully trends
in the beaver population, we have combined the harvest data with a
model of biological resource extraction to simulate the stock of beaver
in the Fort Albany hinterland. Our simulations turn out to be very

that affected trappers. See Novak, "Beaver," p. 291.

sensitive to the parameter values that we select and must, therefore, be
regarded as suggestive of only one possible scenario. They do, however, have the feature of being generally consistent with the qualitative
evidence on the trade, the beaver ecology literature, recent surveys of
beaver populations, and the number of furs received at Fort Albany
during the eighteenth century.
The relationship between annual harvest and population was based on
the standard Lotka-Volterra logistic, which relates the natural growth of
a biomass to the animal population:

F(X) = aX- bX2, ab>O (1)
where X is the animal population, a is
rate of the population, and b = alX, where X is the upper limit to
population size or the maximum population size. The population
dynamics of the species exploited will depend on the harvest each
period:

X=aX-bX2-H

(2)

where H is the harvest and X is the annual change in population. The
choice of parameter a and maximum population X is central to the
population estimates. They have been based largely on estimates from
the beaver ecology literature and recent Canadian provincial field
reports on beaver densities.

We have set parameter a, the maximum proportional growth rate, at
0.3. This figure is roughly consistent with Payne's beaver life tables and
estimates of rapidly growing beaver populations.32 It also seems to
reflect beaver population growth in one small area of the region in the
twentieth century, where the beaver recovered from virtual extinction.33
As is evident from the preceding discussion, French competition was an
important element and must be incorporated. According to Ray, French
traders after 1740 were trading in much of the Fort Albany hinterland,
and the 1755 estimate implies that the English and French harvests in
the region were about the same. We allowed for increased French
competition by assuming the Hudson's Bay Company was harvesting a
32 Henry and Bookhout analyzed a rapidly growing beaver population in Ohio during the
mid-1960s. They estimated that, exclusive of adult mortality, the population was increasing at 49
percent per year. Since the adult population was 60 percent of the total, allowing a 30 percent
mortality rate among adults gives a net annual rate of population growth of about 30 percent. See
Henry and Bookhout, "Productivity," pp. 931-32; and Payne, "Mortality Rates," pp. 119, 124.
Beaver populations have also been analyzed by Bergerud and Miller, "Population Dynamics";
Boyce, "Beaver Life-History Responses"; Jenkins and Busher, "Castor Canadensis"; and
Navakowski, "Population Dynamics."

33 Novak reports that in an area of southern Ontario where the beaver recovered from vi

extinction, the number of beaver families increased from zero in 1937 to 18 in 1948 to 254 in 195
Assuming a value of one rather than zero in 1937, the implied annual rates of growth are 30 perc
from 1937 to 1948, and 27.2 percent from 1948 to 1959. See Novak, "Beaver," p. 291.

hinterland that gradually shrank in size from 70 percent of the total

available area in 1720 to 50 percent in 1740.34
Having incorporated the French harvests in this manner, we then
selected a value of X and simulated the beaver population using

equation 2 and observed Hudson's Bay Company harvests. Values of X
that are too low imply an extinction path and so were rejected. Values

of X that are too high lead to unreasonably large beaver populations in
the 1750s and 1760s when, as we have noted, the evidence for depletion
is compelling. As a further check that our procedure was generating
reasonable results, we compared the beaver densities implied by our

simulations to recent Ontario Ministry estimates of beaver densities in
the region.35

Figure 3 and Table 1 present the population simulations in the Fort

Albany hinterland where X, the maximum population, has been set at
344,000.36 The maximum density implied by this estimate is about 0.6
beaver per square kilometer. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources surveyed the Fort Albany hinterland and, as part of its land use

plan, included estimates of the potential beaver harvest, which was set
at 30 percent of the stock. The implied population density of 0.5 beaver
per square kilometer that emerged from that study is consistent with the

maximum density assumed in our simulation.37
From 1700 to 1717 according to our simulation, the population

declined, which is the expected pattern for a resource that has not yet
been fully exploited, but by 1717 the beaver population appeared to
have reached an equilibrium. For the next 20 years the stock remained at
levels roughly consistent with maximum sustained yield management38
3 We assume that the Hudson's Bay Company harvested a hinterland of 70 percent of the total
area available in 1720. This area declined from 1720 to the 1740s and then remained constant at 50
percent. These assumptions are based on the historical evidence that some French competition

existed prior to 1720, that it increased from 1720 to the 1740s, and that it remained relatively
unchanged thereafter.

" Their estimates are based largely on aerial surveys of beaver colonies and reports from trap
lines.

36 The choice of 344,000 is based, in part, on the simulation results. Even a slightly lower value
gives rise to an extinction path, whereas a slightly higher value implies no depletion in the 1750s,
when the evidence for depletion is compelling. The starting point for the simulations is somewhat
arbitrarily put at 60 percent of maximum population, but results are not sensitive to this
assumption.

37 See Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, Land Use Guidelines. According to the land use
plans for districts within the Fort Albany hinterland, excluding the district of Moosonee, the

average beaver density in the early 1980s was 0.67 beaver/km2. In the Moosonee district, however,
the density was only 0.10 beaver/km2 according to information supplied to us by the Ontario
Ministry of Natural Resources. The relevant area of Moosonee comprises about 30 percent of what
was the Fort Albany hinterland, implying that the average beaver density in that hinterland during

the early 1980s was about 0.5 beaver/km2. Given that the beaver had not been heavily exploited
during previous periods, an observed density roughly 80 percent of the maximum seems plausible.

38 Obtaining a maximum sustained yield may not necessarily have been the optimal policy for the
Hudson's Bay Company, but it provides a useful benchmark with which to compare the actual

(see Figure 3). In the 1740s, however, a combination of greater Fr
competition and unabated trading by the Hudson's Bay Company began
to deplete the stock. This pattern of depletion was especially apparent
during the period from 1747 to 1749, when Fort Albany received an

average of 20,500 pelts, a larger harvest than in any of the preceding 20
years. According to our simulation, it was these harvests in particular
that devastated the beaver colonies, reducing the stock to about half of
maximum sustained yield levels. This decline led not only to meager fur
returns throughout the 1750s but to modest harvests in the 1760s as well.
Unlike Fort Albany, which faced competition early in the eighteenth
century, York Factory was protected by distance until the 1730s. In
1732 the French established Fort St. Charles on Lake of the Woods and

in 1734 built Fort Maurepas at the mouth of the Red River (see Figure

1). These posts, both located near the southeastern limit of the York
Factory hinterland, provided some competition, but it was not until the
1740s and the building of four additional trading posts that large
harvests. The extent to which the Hudson's Bay Company did indeed pursue a profit-maximizing
strategy is examined in Carlos and Lewis, "Optimal Beaver Harvests."

numbers of furs were diverted to Montreal. By 1755, the French
accounted for 40 percent of the region's trade.39
The pattern of returns at York Factory from 1717 to 1763 not only
reflected the increasing French competition, but was also strongly
indicative of depletion. In the early years, from 1717 to 1730, returns
were increasing but highly variable, consistent with an emerging trade.
Then in the 1730s, the trade stabilized at about 30,000 furs annually, a
harvest that approximated the maximum sustained yield of the region
(see Figure 4). The first break in the pattern came in the early 1740s. The
French built Fort La Raine in 1738 and three years later established two
more posts, both in the heart of the York Factory hinterland. Surprisingly, given the greater competition, trade at York Factory increased
markedly, to an average of 34,000 furs over the period from 1740 to
1743. Indeed, the 1742 return of 37,727 was the largest since the French

of a simulation that uses the same methodology applied to Fort Albany.
The York Factory hinterland was considerably larger, close to one
million square kilometers, but beaver densities were almost certainly
less. Our simulation is based on a maximum beaver population in the
region of 462,000, or just under 0.5 beaver per square kilometer. This
density is somewhat lower than the value assumed for the Fort Albany

hinterland, but is consistent with the type of vegetation-boreal forestthat dominates the region.

We somewhat arbitrarily have put the beaver population in 1716 at 60

percent of the unexploited level of 462,000.40 From this level, according
to our simulation, the population declined to about 240,000 in the 1730s,
which is roughly equal to the population consistent with maximum
sustained yield management. The falling population during this period,
although partly a consequence of some very large harvests, did not

indicate overharvesting of the stock. It simply represented the usual
pattern observed when a resource has been previously underexploited.
With the increase in French competition starting in 1738, however, the
beaver population became severely depleted. Depletion occurred not

simply because the French were taking more furs from the region, but
more importantly, because harvesting by the Hudson's Bay Company

also increased. According to our simulation, the beaver population
during the 1740s declined to just above 60 percent of the level consistent
with a maximum sustained yield, and these low levels persisted through
the 1750s, although there was a modest recovery in the early 1760s (see
Figure 4).

Unlike Fort Albany and York Factory, the third post-Fort
Churchill-was too far west and north to face significant competition
from the French. The fur returns at Fort Churchill show a markedly

different pattern from the two more central trading posts (see Figure 2
and Table 1). During the 1720s the returns were very low, which is
indicative of a post that had yet to become fully established, although
the inexperience of post factor Richard Norton almost certainly played
some role.41 After 1727, when Norton was replaced, returns increased
sharply, and although highly variable, they exhibited only a slight
downward trend for the remaining years to 1763. In fact, if we remove
the years up to 1744, a period when the beaver population had not yet
been fully exploited, the harvest hardly declined at all.
Applying our earlier methodology, we have simulated the beaver

4 Our simulations turn out not to be sensitive to the assumed initial population. For example,
assuming the starting point is 80 percent rather than 60 percent of the maximum population and
assuming a slightly smaller maximum population (456,000 rather than 462,000), we derive, after ten
years, an almost identical population stream.

41 In its letter removing Norton from his position as chief trader, the London Committee stressed
that the low returns were due not to any opportunism on his part but rather to lack of experience.
Norton was then demoted and sent to York Factory, although he later returned to Churchill as chief
trader. See Carlos and Nicholas, "Agency Problems," p. 871.

population in the Fort Churchill hinterland. The area, at 500,000 square
kilometers, was just 15 percent smaller than the region served by Fort
Albany, but it almost certainly supported a much smaller beaver

population. At 0.3 beaver per square kilometer, the density is assumed
50 percent lower than our Fort Albany estimate, which is entirely
consistent with the nature of the terrain-tundra and boreal forest,
neither of which can sustain a large beaver population.42 Our estimate of
the maximum stock is 140,000. Despite the low population density, we
simulate much more stable beaver stocks than at the other trading posts
(see Figure 5 and Table 1). From 1722 to 1742, population fell from an
assumed 60 percent of the unexploited size to the maximum sustained
yield level of 70,000. Although the population fell briefly below that
level, it soon climbed back. The pattern at Fort Churchill is thus in
direct contrast to the behavior of population in the Fort Albany and
York Factory hinterlands. The lack of French competition was almost
certainly a direct factor in explaining the stability, but in addition, the
fact that the Hudson's Bay Company had a monopoly in the region may
have led to a strategy that discouraged depletion.
42 The lower population density is due primarily to the high latitude of Fort Churchill.

484 Carlos and Lewis
HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY PRICING POLICY

The analysis so far has assumed that the Hudson's Bay Company
could control the number of furs traded at each post, but given the
nature of its relationship with the Indians, it could do so only indirectly.

After all, Indians did the actual trapping. The Company, however, could

set fur prices through its post managers, and it was pricing policy, we
argue, that ultimately determined, or at least strongly affected, the size
of the beaver harvest. We have estimated prices at the three posts in

order to study their influence on the beaver population. Throughout the
period from 1700 to 1763, posted prices were based on the Company's

Official Standard, which remained constant over time and was the same
across posts. The actual prices received by the Indians, however, rarely
equaled that standard because, as mentioned earlier, post managers
were permitted to offer lower prices to the Indians, in which case the
managers recorded an overplus in the accounts. At the same time, the

trading process required that managers incur expenses in addition to
the value of goods traded directly for furs. These expenses represented

the cost of gifts given to the Indians that were a very important
ceremonial feature of the trade. When the overplus exceeded expenses,
the Indians received less than the official standard for their furs, and
when the reverse was true they received more. Because both the
overplus and the expenses are reported in the annual accounts of each

post, it is possible to derive a price series for each area (see Table 1).
There appears to be a connection between the prices the Indians
received for their furs and the size of the beaver stocks (see Figures 3

through 5). In the Fort Albany region, we estimate that from 1717 to
1730, when there was almost no change in fur prices, the beaver
population was stable or rising; whereas from the 1730s to the early
1750s, when fur prices rose by 40 percent, the (simulated) beaver
population declined by 50 percent. This negative relationship between
fur prices and beaver stocks is also observed in the York Factory data.
In that region, the simulated population fell from an average of 242,000
in the 1730s to 146,000 in the period 1751 to 1755, whereas fur prices at

the trading post went from 0.69 to 1.02 Made Beaver. Equally suggestive is the evidence from Fort Churchill. In that region, we estimate that

the beaver population remained fairly stable after the early 1740s, and
the slight upward trend in the price series is consistent with that
stability.
We formalize the relationship between prices and beaver stocks by
appealing, as in the previous section, to the fisheries literature. (For a
presentation of the model that uses specific functional forms, see the
Appendix.) According to that literature, the per period harvest (H) will
depend positively on the level of harvesting effort (E) and the size of the

resource stock (X).

Equilibrium is achieved where the harvest just equals natural replacement:
H=

bX2

(6)

The effect of price on the equilibrium beaver population can be

derived from equations 3 through 6. An increase in price raises the
return to harvesting effort, which induces more harvesting effort and
gives rise to a larger harvest. In the longer run, however, the larger
harvest reduces the beaver population and this feeds back into the

system. A smaller population would reduce harvests even if effort
remained constant, as described in equation 3; but, in fact, the level of
effort declines because the return to effort is lowered (see equations 4
and 5). Thus, both effects contribute to lower harvests, which in turn

moderate the decline in population. Ultimately a new equilibrium is
reached where the harvest and the stock of beaver are again in balance.
The effect of fur prices on the beaver population, as predicted by the
model, is illustrated in the Fort Albany hinterland from 1717/21 to
1750/54 (see Table 3). Within each five-year interval the beaver population was stable, but between periods it fell by 47 percent, from an
average of 162,000 to an average of 86,000. Our adjustment model
supports the suggestion made earlier that Hudson's Bay Company
pricing policy was an important element in the depletion of beaver

stocks. According to the model, the increase in price, from 0.68 MB
(Made Beaver) in the earlier period to 0.97 MB in the later one, reduced
the stock of beavers to between 87,000 and 139,000 and therefore
accounts for between 30 and 100 percent of the estimated decline in

population.43
The York Factory hinterland also experienced a drop in beaver

stocks. From 1735/39 to 1751/55, the population fell from an average of
242,000 to an average of 146,000, or by about 40 percent. Here again the
price the Indians received for furs, which rose from 0.69 MB to 1.02
MB, appears crucial. According to our adjustment model, the increase
4 The wide range of estimates is based on elasticities of supply of effort that vary from 0.25 to
2.0. Assuming the intermediate and, possibly, more plausible values of 0.5 and 1.0 gives rise to
estimates of the contribution of price to the population decline that lie between 55 and 86 percent.

DEPLETION, OVEREXPLOITATION, AND THE HUDSON'S BAY
COMPANY'S REACTION

The preceding analysis highlights the role played by price in the
overexploitation of the beaver population. But ultimately, it was the fact
of the French presence and the Company's reaction to that presence
that determined the extent of harvesting and the resulting stock of the
resource. Indeed, the fact of a French presence is commonly cited in the
correspondence between the managers and the head office as the reason
for the declining returns at Hudson's Bay Company trading posts.45 The
effect of French competition on the trade at Fort Albany is well

documented in the letters sent from that post to the head office in
London, which provide a good description of the actions and reactions
of the Hudson's Bay Company managers.
In 1716, which was part of a period in which we estimate that the

beaver population was close to maximum sustained yield levels (see
Figure 3), Thomas Macklish, the chief trader, wrote:
I have told all the Indians not to bring any summer beaver, neither in coat nor
parchment. I likewise burnt 150 coat and parchment before their faces, telling
" The range is narrowed considerably if we use the intermediate supply elasticities, 0.5 and 1.0.
The contribution of price to the population decline now falls between 47 and 75 percent.

4' The initial response of the Governor and Committee to French competition was a political one
They tried, but failed, to get the French to honor the preliminaries to the Treaty of Utrecht by
leaving their posts in the area.

them at the same time that it is of no value with us; upon which all the Indians in

general has promised to bring no more summer beaver. I likewise told all the
Indians not to make any cub skin coats, which is somewhat impossible for the
indians to perform, unless they were to make coats of summer beaver, for as soon
as the winter setts in they are obliged to make use of the first beaver they catch

to keep them from freezing.46

But in the same letter, Macklish told the Committee that "it is certain
the French began their new settlement up this river last summer and

have built two houses in the centre of those Indians that have used this
place ever since it was settled by the English."47 Macklish knew this not
just because the Indians told him, but also because they came carrying
French goods. However, he felt that the French would not be much of
a problem because "They all in general told me that the French trades

hard with them, and that I give twice the value from beaver and all other
furs, cats excepted"-upon which he raised the rate for cats, "which

has given good satisfaction to the Indians and they have promised to
come here next summer to trade and bring what cats they kill with
them.' '48 Interestingly, at the same time that Macklish was saying that

the French would not be a problem, he responded to the French
presence by increasing the price of at least one fur.

In 1722 Joseph Myatt, who was then chief factor, wrote that the
Albany returns had declined because "we have not had any of the

leading Indians down with us to trade that were here last year.'
hoped that they had gone to York Factory, although he knew that the
Moose River Indians and the Tibithebe Indians had gone to the French.50
His response was to "make some presents to the two leading Indians of

Moose River . . . being in great hopes that will induce them to come

here again. "95 In his 1726 letter, Myatt, who was once again chief
trader, replacing Richard Staunton, told the Committee that "Mr
Staunton tells me, to encourage the native, he promised them to trade
them martens at two per beaver the next year, therefore hopes you

honours will not take it amiss if I should trade them so."52 Thus from a
position in 1716 when the Company's traders were burning furs to
discourage trapping of inferior skins, the traders in the mid-1720s slowly
eroded that position by increasing the standard on particular furs. By
the 1730s the policy of raising price was extended to the most important
fur, beaver, and as a result we see a marked increase in the overall price

index. As we show in Table 2, the increases in price had significant
long-run repercussions on the beaver stock.
A second policy response to French competition, used far more
occasionally, was to send out individuals to persuade the Indians to
come to the Bay posts to trade. The policy was pursued at Albany to the
unusual point that the Company set up an inland post, Henley House. It
was not considered a trading post, but rather an interception point from
which the traders could entice and direct Indians down to the Bay.53

York Factory's manager, James Isham, built Flamborough House up
river from the coast in 1750, again to intercept the Indians. But once the

level of competition declined, Isham closed the post. The head office
wrote to Isham in 1753 noting that "as you are of opinion that if a proper

Person were sent a great way up into the Country with presents to the
Indians it May be a means of drawing down many of the Natives to

Trade We approve therof."54 In terms of the issue of depletion, these
policies-setting up interception posts and sending people inland-were

structured to increase the flow of furs to the Bay, but this strategy also
included the use of presents, which increased the prices paid to the
Indians.
It seems clear that the responses to French competition were dam-

aging to the underlying resource stock, but these actions cannot be seen

in isolation from other Company objectives. A primary feature of
Company policy throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century was
the desire of the head office to maintain control of the trade. This desire
manifested itself in two ways. The first was in the attempt of the
Company to maintain close trading relationships with the various Indian
tribes. Managers, for example, were willing to bum furs during periods
when there was no competition, but they were unwilling "to disgust the
Indians" by such policies or by refusing to purchase poorer quality
skins once the French became a threat. The second was in the
imposition of controls on Company managers, who, nevertheless, were
given enough flexibility to respond to the French presence.

One of the most important devices used by the Company in its efforts
to monitor managerial effort was the post account books. The head
office combined the information given in the accounts with data on the
quantity of trade goods sent out to the posts and furs shipped from those
posts to England. These were then used to create terms-of-trade
indices, or measures of managerial performance. Whenever the index
fell below a given level, the head office would write and complain about
the returns and often would recall, demote, or even fire the trader. 5 The
S This post represents one of the few instances in the pre- 1770 period when the Company moved
away from the Bay. Henley House was closed in 1754 when the Indians destroyed it and killed all
the personnel. Rich, History, vol. 1, chap. 42.

objectives of the Company were laid out to Joseph Isbister when he took
over command of Fort Churchill: "we have nothing more at Heart than
the Preservation of our Factorys, the Security of our People and the
Encrease of our Trade."36 Although maintenance of the resource base

should have been important, the operation of this policy made it difficult
for individual managers to react to depletion. During a period of

competition, an individual manager who refused to trade for small or
summer furs would find that his returns were falling, as the Indians now

had alternative opportunities. Such a strategy would be risky for a
manager because, in the face of such falling returns, the head office
would find it very difficult to distinguish between a manager operating in
the long-term interest of the Company and one who was just incompetent or behaving opportunistically.

We must also ask just how apparent the decline in the resource base
would have been during this period. In one sense, the evidence available
to the Company was the same as that available to us. We used the actual
numbers of furs traded at each of the three posts. But it is clear from
Figure 2 that there was a large variability in the returns. The downward
trend is evident only retrospectively. In addition to these returns, we
also used modern ecology literature on the beaver to generate estimates
of the underlying population. This information would not have been
available to the Company. However, two other sources of information

were available: the Indians and the traders. James Isham, chief trader at
York and at Churchill, was also a well-respected British naturalist. He
wrote of the beaver in the early 1740s, that "I'tts a Little strange the
Breed of these beaver Does not Diminish greatly considereing the many

thousands that is Killd.of a Year."57 Later, in his description of the
number of young born, he reported "some having five and six at a
time."58 We know from the ecology literature that only in an irrupting
population will a beaver bear that number of young. In a stable
environment, the number is around three. Isham's intuition that the
beaver stock should have been declining at York is correct and is borne

out by our simulations, but the precipitous decline in population
occurred only after Isham made these comments.
The Indians were also a potential source of information on the state of
the underlying animal population. Here the situation is clouded by the
fact that beaver was not the only fur traded. Although beaver was the

most important, and the head office kept the accounts in terms of Made
Beaver, a manager could keep his total Made Beaver return up by
ensuring an increasing (or at least not decreasing) supply of other furs.
As pointed out earlier, what is commonly seen is that as the number of
beaver traded declined, the number of martens traded increased. Thus,

490 Carlos and Lewis
the Indians could substitute one fur for another in the trading process,
which reduced their incentive to conserve any one resource.
Yet even if the Indians told Company managers about the true state
of the underlying population, that information was likely to be downplayed if not completely ignored. The problem was one of the role of

information in the bargaining process. As Isham wrote in his Observations,
The worst property that attends these Natives is their false information, for if you
put a Question to them, as I have Done oft's, they will anser to what I Desir's, at

the same time neither her'd see, or new any thing of the matter, so by several
other casses, by which they are not to be Really's on unless all points upon the
same Subject, as the proverb is, what all say's is true, but I found the Contrary by
these Natives.59

All of the forces discussed above made it difficult for the Hudson's
Bay Company to realize the serious nature of the problem and thus to
devise a response to it. In fact, it was not until 1821 when the resource
base was almost exterminated, that the Company was able to merge
with its main rival and begin to put in place policies to deal with the
problem of overexploitation.60 After 1821 the Hudson's Bay Company
returned once again to a policy of refusing to purchase small or young

skins and even to burning such skins to show the Indians that they were
serious.
CONCLUSION

The theme of competition and depletion of biological resources has
been played out in other contexts, and the plots have a familiar ring. A
previously unexploited or underexploited resource is suddenly opened
to a new harvesting technology or to new markets. As long as the
exploiter can control access, the harvesting is at an appropriate level.
Once this control is lost, however, the resource becomes degraded. This
is our story of the beaver during the early years of the Hudson's Bay

Company. Where the Company had a monopoly, it pursued a maximum
sustained yield strategy in regard to the animal stock; but once sole
access was lost, as happened when the French infiltrated its trading
areas, the strategy changed. To meet the competition, the Company
raised the prices they paid to the Indians, and the Indians responded in
the short run with larger harvests. But these harvests were not sustainable, and ultimately the beaver population declined. Only in the area
protected by distance from French competition was the animal stock
maintained at close to optimal levels.
Our results suggest that both the Hudson's Bay Company and the
Indians on whom they relied were victims of the same market forces

that continue to afflict other "fisheries." The unhappy outcome in two

of the trading areas in our study thus represents not a failure by either
party to respond to the changing market, but rather their success in

confronting a competitor in an industry where private rationality meant
lower returns for all.

Appendix: The Effect of Price on the
Equilibrium Beaver Population
We assume specific functional forms in equations 3 and 4 to derive empirical estimates

of the effect of price on the (simulated) beaver population. The harvest function is
assumed constant-elasticity, with nonincreasing returns to effort and population:

H=FEPXG, 0<a,,B'1 (7)
The effort function is also a constant-elasticity relationship:

E=er8,

6>0

(8)

where 8 is the elasticity of supply of effort. Noting that r = pHIE, it follows from
equation 7 that

r

=

pE(P-

I)Xa

(9)

Substituting equation 9 into equation 8 and rearranging terms gives the following:

E = (epSXaS)i /[D + 8(1 - /3)] (10)
Substituting equation 10 into equation 7 gives us a relationship between the harvest, the
price of furs, and the stock of animals:

H = [e~pPBXa(I + 8)]1/[1 + 8(1 - O] (11)
For a given population, X, the elasticity of the harvest with respect to the price of furs

is ,8/[I + 8(1 - f3)], which for /3 = 1 is the same as the elasticity of supply of effort. Over
the longer run, however, fur prices will also influence the harvest indirectly because the
beaver population will change. The long-run equilibrium effect of a change in price from
period 0 to period 1 is derived by substituting equation 11 into equation 6:

(PoN3 BP X\ a(1 + 8) (aX -bXo2\ [I + B(1 -)]

(pi) \XoJ kaXv bXl2) (12)
Equation 12 provides the basis for our estimates of the effect of price on the beaver
population. Central to these estimates are the values of the elasticity parameters, a and
/3. Here we suggest the likely orders of magnitude by deriving a harvest function
specifically for beaver.
It appears that harvesting beaver involved three costs: the cost of finding them, which
was not very difficult because beaver are territorial; the cost of killing them and
preparing them for market, which was reasonably difficult in that the lodges had to be
broken into; and the cost of entering the trade. The first cost depends on distance and
thus is related both to the size of the harvest and the density of the beaver population.
Suppose the hunter is based at location B in the following diagram.

where w is the travel cost per beaver per unit distance walked, we derive the total travel

cost of harvesting beaver within radius, xO, of B as

X0 2 3

C(xo) = J wxh(x)dx= -rwkxo3 (16)
Substituting equation 14 into equation 16 and rearranging terms, we have

H(xo)= (-)2- Z113[c(XO)]2/3k1/3 (17)
Noting that density, k, is proportional to the beaver population and cost, C(xO), is
proportional to effort, we can write the harvest function as

H= K . E2/3XI/3 (18)
Including the cost of killing and preparing beaver for market and the cost of entering the
trade will tend to reduce the population elasticity a, and increase the effort elasticity 3.
Although we have no empirical estimates of a and 8 for beaver, Henderson and

Tugwell have estimated a harvest function for lobster, another nonmigratory species.
Their estimates are a = .44 and p = .48.61
