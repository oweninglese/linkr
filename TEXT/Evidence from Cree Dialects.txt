deployment of evidentials. CP-external evidentials include quotative verbs (attested
in all Cree dialects) and reportative particles (in Plains Cree). IP-external evidentials
include dubitative particles (in Plains Cree) as well as afﬁxal indirect evidentials that are
temporally conditioned (in Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi). The proposed analysis of evidential types in Cree dialects lends support to the Evidential Domain Hypothesis (Blain
and Déchaine 2006) that claims that evidentials differ from each other according to the
syntactic domain in which they are introduced.

1. The syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of evidentials. Evidential
markers are elements that introduce the speaker’s perspective regarding the
information being presented (Chafe and Nichols 1986) and indicate the
speaker’s degree of commitment to the truth of what s/he is uttering. We
look at evidential marking across a range of Cree dialects, comparing the
western-most variety of Cree (Plains Cree) with the eastern-most varieties
(the Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi complex).2 For example, in Plains Cree, the
most frequent evidentials include the quotative verb itwê-, the reportative
particle êsa, and the dubitative particle êtokwê/êtikwê (Wolfart 1998). Representative examples are given in (1).3

Cree is a member of the Algonquian language family and displays a high degree of dialect
diversity: Plains Cree is spoken on the Prairies; Woods, Swampy, and Moose Cree constitute a
succession of distinct dialects ranging across a northern tier from Saskatchewan to Ontario;
ﬁnally, the Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi complex of Québec and Labrador forms the eastern edge
of the dialect continuum.

1.1. The Evidential Domain Hypothesis. We propose that evidential
markers can be introduced in a number of different positions in the clause.
We assume that clauses are partitioned into at least four domains: the clausetyping domain (CP), the temporal domain (IP), the aspectual domain (AspP),
and the predicate domain (vP). This is illustrated in (2). Accordingly, at least
four different kinds of evidentials are predicted to exist depending on which
part of the clause they are associated with, as in (3).

question marker cî in combination with matwân. It is glossed by Wolfart and Ahenakew
(1998:82) as a polar dubitative and is one of the minor modes of Plains Cree evidentials (Blain
et al. 2006).

For discussion and motivation of the proposed four-way syntactic typology, see Blain and Déchaine (2006).5 Our claim that there are different types
of evidentials is novel; we call this the Evidential Domain Hypothesis. The
Evidential Domain Hypothesis contrasts with proposals that analyze evidentials as a uniform syntactic and/or semantic class. For example, Cinque
(1999) posits a dedicated syntactic position for evidentials, while Faller
(2002) argues, on semantic grounds, that evidentials are invariably illocutionary operators.
We argue that the Evidential Domain Hypothesis, as applied to data from
Cree dialects (Plains Cree, East Cree, Montagnais, Naskapi), reveals the existence of two classes of evidentials in Cree: CP-external versus IP-external.6
1.2. The syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of Cree evidentials.
The present analysis locates evidentials in different parts of the clause. The
question we now address is which of these domains is relevant for Cree
evidentials. Evidence from Cree dialects supports the distinction between
CP-external and IP-external evidentials. CP-external evidentials introduce
the speaker’s perspective at the CP level. Semantically, they have illocutionary force. IP-external evidentials introduce the speaker’s perspective at the
IP level. Semantically, they have temporal and/or modal force.
We argue that quotatives (attested in Plains Cree and Cree/Montagnais/
Naskapi [henceforth CMN]) and reportatives (attested in Plains Cree) are introduced in a CP-external position (4a). In contrast to this, dubitatives and
nonfactuals (attested in Plains Cree) and indirect evidentials (attested in
CMN) are introduced in an IP-external position (4b).7 After showing how
5
For related discussion, see Faller (2003a; 2004), who recognizes the existence of two types
of evidentials on semantic grounds; her semantic classiﬁcation corresponds to the distinction
drawn here between CP-external and IP-external evidentials. Blain and Déchaine (2006) propose that the “perfect of evidentiality” (Izvorski 1997) is an instance of an AspP-external evidential, while the nonvolitional force of nonvisual evidentials in the ﬁrst person (as reported by
Curnow 2001, based on Ramirez 1997) is analyzed as an instance of vP-external evidentials.
6
For alternatives to the syntactic analysis advocated here, see the pragmatic typology of Willett (1988) and the semantic typology of Speas (2004a; 2004b).

Cinque (1999:174, n. 37) lists allegedly, obviously, clearly, and evidently as evidential adverbs in English (Chafe 1986 and Fraser 1996), and takes the contrast in (i ) below to reﬂect the
[Evaluative < Evidential] order. However, speakers we have consulted accept the [Eval < Evid]
order only if evidently has comma and focus intonation, as in (iib).

2. The heterogeneity of Plains Cree evidentials. The semantic and
pragmatic properties of evidentials present the analyst with speciﬁc methodological problems that we discuss brieﬂy (2.1). After surveying the evidential forms attested in Plains Cree (2.2), we show that Plains Cree
evidentials are syntactically heterogeneous and argue that this heterogeneity
is best understood in terms of how different types of evidentials are introduced, in particular whether they are CP-external (2.3) or IP-external (2.4).
2.1. The context of Plains Cree evidentials. Since evidentials can only
be felicitously uttered by a speaker relative to a given context, any description or analysis requires that one examine their context of use. Conversations
and extended narratives are the most natural source for this kind of data; the
Plains Cree data reported here are drawn from narratives by Whitecalf
(1993), Minde (1997), Kâ-Nîpihtêtêw (1998), and Ahenakew (2000).
In addition to controlling for context, another factor to consider is the
translation process, which for evidentials is “notoriously difﬁcult” (Faller
2002:3, n. 4). Some evidential morphemes translate into English verbs of
saying: for example, the quotative is often rendered as X said “S.” The reportative can be rendered as X reported S. There is also the possibility of
translating these elements as adverbs, as with the reportative (reportedly S),
or as modals (it must be the case that S).
2.2. The form of Plains Cree evidentials. In Plains Cree, several elements have the status of evidential markers.8 As mentioned above, the most
frequently occurring are quotative itwê-, reportative êsa, and dubitative
êtokwê (Wolfart 1998). In addition, there is a nonfactual evidential, êska,
which rarely occurs in Modern Plains Cree but is attested in earlier forms of
8

James et al. (2001:230) state that “evidentials occur . . . only in the [Cree] varieties in Quebec and Labrador.” D. James (personal communication) informs us that this is a claim about
afﬁxal evidentials only. As we shall see, while evidentials in Modern Plains Cree are particles,
they are afﬁxal in CMN.

the language. Morphosyntactically, Plains Cree evidentials are heterogeneous: while quotative itwê- is a verb, reportative êsa, nonfactual êska, and
dubitative êtokwê are particles.9 Their dictionary deﬁnitions, adapted from
Wolfart and Ahenakew (WA) (1998), are given in (5).
(5a) it- vta say thus to s.o., say this of s.o. (WA 1998:39)
it- vti say thus of s.t., say thus about s.t. (WA 1998:39)
itwê- vai say thus, call (it) thus; have such a meaning (WA 1998:44)
itwêmakan- vii say thus, have such a meaning (WA 1998:44)
itwêski- vai say thus habitually, always say thus (WA 1998:44)
(5b) êsa ipc reportedly [i.e., information received from others, in contrast
to êtokwê and pakahkam] (WA 1998:34)
(5c) êtokwê ipc presumably, I guess [sic; cf. êtikwê; dubitative, reﬂecting
personal inference, in contrast to êsa and pakahkam] (WA 1998:34)
(5d) êska ipc beyond belief [revelatory] (WA 1998:34)
In addition to these four main types of evidentials, there are also “minor
modes” of evidentiality (cf. Goddard 1995). For example, in Plains Cree,
there are two other elements that seem to function as evidentials, namely,
pakahkam and matwân cî, deﬁned as follows:
(6a) pakahkam ipc I think; perhaps [expectation, in contrast to êsa and
êtokwê] (WA 1998:142)
(6b) matwân cî ipc I wonder [polar dubitative] (WA 1998:82)
In this paper, we do not treat these minor modes of evidentials, other than
to note their existence.10
2.3. CP-external evidentials in Plains Cree. Plains Cree CP-external
evidentials include quotative itwê- and reportative êsa. Following Faller
(2002:16), we treat these as illocutionary operators that present information.
2.3.1. Plains Cree quotative itwê-. Quotative itwê- and its variants
have several properties in common. In terms of its discourse function, the
9

Many Proto-Algonquian afﬁxal modes have been replaced by particles or preverbs in
Plains Cree (D. Pentland, personal communication). The particle êsa (from Proto-Algonquian
*ye:sani ) replaced the afﬁxal assertive mode (-san-), which corresponds to Bloomﬁeld’s
(1962) present tense. The preverb kî- replaced the afﬁxal preterit (-pan-), with the old preterit
form now used for other functions. (For related discussion, see Pentland 1984; 1988.) Plains
Cree êtokwê (and its cognate forms) is from Proto-Algonquian *ye:toke:, a particle which has
replaced the older dubitative inﬂection with *-toke:- on the verb; see the Cree verb paradigms
of Ellis (1971).
10
Given the deﬁnitions of Wolfart and Ahenakew (1998), we expect these minor modes of
evidentials to fall into the class of indirect evidentials.

quotative presents evidence in historical and personal narratives. Morphosyntactically, quotative itwê- is a verb; as such, it can be inﬂected for ﬁrst-,
second-, or third-person subject agreement, and it occurs with tense/aspect
markers. Although the quotative is often translated as a verb of saying—for
example, Wolfart and Ahenakew (1998:39) gloss it as ‘say thus’—a more accurate translation of itwê- would be as a verb of ‘thus-ing’. This captures the
fact that itwê- is not, strictly speaking, a verb of saying; rather it only presents direct speech.11 This contrasts with English-type say, which presents
both direct speech (John said, “I left”) and indirect speech (John said that
he left). Finally, in terms of its position, quotative itwê- usually occurs to the
right of the proposition that it is associated with, as in (7).

(Ahenakew 2000:108, lines 20–21)
Quotative itwê- sometimes precedes the clause, as in (8). As far as we can
determine, such examples are most often attested when the quotative is sandwiched between a modifying element and the main body of the quotation. In
(8a), the modifying element is kiyâm ‘let it be’; in (8b), it is îh ‘look’. We
analyze such expressions as adverbs that take propositional scope, i.e., they
modify the entire clause quoted.

11

It would be more accurate to describe itwê- as a “presentational” evidential, rather than a
quotative per se. For related discussion, see Faller (2002).

A third possibility is for the quotative to be sentence-initial, as in (9). For
the texts that we have access to, this seems to be quite rare.

Our analysis of quotative itwê- is as follows.12 First, we claim that it is
CP-external; this captures the fact that it takes propositional scope. Second,
we propose that it introduces a discourse-linked operator (OP) in its speciﬁer
position. This yields the base structure in (10). The canonical right-peripheral surface position of quotative itwê- arises by displacement of the CP
to the left (11a). Alternatively, an element may be introduced into the operator position, as in (11b); since this sentence-initial position usually has an
adverbial function, we label it as such. In a context such as (11b), leftward movement of the CP to sentence-initial position is blocked, and quotative itwê- surfaces between the initial position and the CP. Finally, it is
possible—though rare—for quotative itwê- to occur in sentence-initial position (11c).13

12 In (8), quotative itwê- has no tense marking and the default temporal orientation is past;

this is a general property of eventive verbs in Plains Cree. In (8a), the verbal status of quotative
itwê- is conﬁrmed by the fact that it can be inﬂected with future/irrealis ka-.
13
As with Plains Cree, Quechua CP-external evidentials also show second-position effects
(Blain and Déchaine 2006) in that they are associated with a Focus position (Muysken 1995)
that follows an initial Topic position.

(11c) sentence-initial quotative (cf. 9)
[EVIDP OP [EVID=QUOTE [itwê-] [CP . . .]]]
Observe that if an adverbial element precedes quotative itwê-, it is construed as part of the quotation (cf. 8). Such adverb-initial orders could also
be derived by raising the adverb out of the CP to Spec, EvidP. This might be
a plausible analysis for (8a), where kiyâm is clearly connected to the lower
quoted CP. However, in (8b), the sentence-initial exclamative îh, while
clearly in the scope of quotative îtêyim- ‘think thus’, is not obviously semantically connected to the quoted CP and so is unlikely to have originated
there.
While sentence-initial adverbs are clearly part of the quoted material,
there are contexts where adverbial modiﬁers are not part of the quotation.
This occurs when the adverb both follows and modiﬁes the quotative, as
in (12).14

(Whitecalf 1993:66, line 14)
Thus, we see that the [Adverb Quotative] order and the [Quotative
Adverb] order differ with respect to the scope of the quotative. This follows
from the present analysis. In a quotative context, a sentence-initial adverb is
necessarily in Spec, EvidP and so is perforce in the scope of the quotative
(13a). As for the [Quotative Adverb] order, this arises when the adverb is
directly modifying the quotative verb (13b).

To summarize, Plains Cree itwê- is almost always found in second-position,
either following the clause it is construed with or following an adverbial
element. We now consider the other CP-external evidential found in Plains
Cree, namely, reportative êsa.
2.3.2. Plains Cree reportative êsa. Plains Cree reportative êsa has the
following properties. Semantically, it indicates that the narrator did not personally witness or experience the event (Wolfart 1998:178); this correlates
with a past orientation. Morphosyntactically, êsa is an invariant particle.
Consider (14). In (14a), the narrator is telling about a woman who ﬁnds
a dead prairie chicken on the road. In (14b), the narrator is providing a secondhand account of someone who turned himself into a jackﬁsh to avoid
being whisked away. In (14c), the narrator is reporting that someone was
related to her husband’s family.

As with quotative itwê-, reportative êsa occurs in one of three positions: it
may follow the proposition it is associated with (14a); it may occur in second position sandwiched between an adverbial element and the clause (14b);

or it may occur in sentence-initial position (14c). The latter seems to be relatively infrequent.
Our analysis of reportative êsa parallels that of quotative itwê-: it is
CP-external, takes propositional scope, and introduces a discourse-linked
operator (OP) in its speciﬁer position. This yields the structure in (15). The
surface position of reportative êsa arises in one of three ways. In (16a), the
CP undergoes leftward movement and surfaces to the left of reportative êsa.
In (16b), the adverbial element is introduced into the operator position
thereby blocking leftward displacement of the CP; consequently, êsa occurs
in second-position between the adverb and the CP. In (16c), êsa occurs in
sentence-initial position.

scope of the reportative. In other words, semantically êsa modiﬁes the proposition as a whole, but syntactically it is inserted into the proposition that it
modiﬁes.

evidential types

Reportative êsa, like quotative itwê-, is analyzed as being a CP-external
evidential. If such evidentials need only be external to CP, we expect them
to co-occur; illustrative examples are given in (18)–(20). We adopt the convention of using “X < Y” to indicate that X is nested inside of Y.

Regarding the co-occurrence of CP-external evidentials, three of the four
logical possibilities are attested: [quote < report], [report < quote], and

[quote < quote]. The absence of [report < report] likely reﬂects the
fact that reportatives present only the speaker’s perspective, so their iteration is pragmatically anomalous (akin to *I reported that I reported S).
This contrasts with quotatives which can present the speech of any speech
act participant (akin to X said “Y said ‘S’”).
To sum up, both quotative itwê- and reportative êsa are introduced in a
CP-external position. They are both associated with an abstract discourselinked operator (OP), which accounts for why the quotative and reportative
are usually second-position elements. The requirement that the OP position
be ﬁlled is satisﬁed by leftward displacement of the CP or by the introduction of an adverbial element to the left of the quotative or reportative. Less
frequent is the occurrence of the quotative and reportative in sentence-initial
position, which seems to be governed by stylistic factors. The rarity of sentence-initial quotatives and reportatives may be related to the requirement
that the OP position be ﬁlled. If so, quotative and reportative evidentials in
sentence-initial position should be felicitous only if the OP is linked to
something else in the preceding discourse.15
2.4. IP-external evidentials in Plains Cree. We now consider the properties of IP-external dubitative êtokwê and nonfactual êska.
2.4.1. Plains Cree dubitative êtokwê. Dubitative êtokwê (or êtikwê) is
an indirect evidential that indicates personal inference. It is temporally unrestricted insofar as it may occur with temporally unmarked verbs as well as
with future and perfective forms. In Modern Plains Cree, dubitative êtokwê
is an invariant particle that precedes or follows the proposition it is associated with. While the Modern Plains Cree dubitative is a particle, the corresponding indirect evidential forms in Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi are afﬁxal.16
As we shall see, this is a primary locus of variation in the Cree evidential
system.
Dubitative êtokwê is often translated into English as the epistemic modal
‘must’ (e.g., John must be here because I see his coat). Such indirect evidentials are not, strictly speaking, modals. In accordance with Faller (2002:10),
we understand inference as the common thread that links indirect evidence
to epistemic necessity: both are ways of acquiring information through reasoning. In addition, inferential indirect evidentials express the speaker’s
judgment that the proposition expressed is necessarily true.
After presenting the contexts in which Plains Cree dubitatives occur
(2.4.1.1), we argue that their IP-external status is consistent with their ordering relative to negation (2.4.1.2) and relative to CP-external evidentials
(2.4.1.3). We close with a discussion of the Modern Plains Cree dubitative
15
For discussion regarding information structure in Plains Cree, see Cook et al. (2005) and
Muehlbauer (2005).

particle in relation to the afﬁxal dubitative that was attested in older forms
of Plains Cree (2.4.1.4).
2.4.1.1. The context of Plains Cree dubitatives. In (21a), the narrator
makes an inference about the belief system of whites based on the observation that some of them participate in all aspects of the Sundance. As for
(21b), this is from a story about an old woman who picks up a roadkill bird
on the way to church, a bird the minister can smell from the front of the
church. The narrator infers the bird must have been dead for awhile. Observe
that, in these examples, the dubitative occurs after the clause it is associated
with.

Dubitative êtokwê also occurs in second position; examples are given in
(22). In (22a), the narrator recounts an incident that took place when she
was a girl. A deranged man is lost and a search party is looking for him.
The party ﬁnds his footprints in the snow, heading toward the place where
treaty days are held. Dubitative êtokwê indicates that the narrator makes an
inference based on information available to her. In (22b), because the minister can smell the bird from the front of the church, the narrator infers that
the roadkill must smell bad.

her laundry.

Our analysis of dubitative êtokwê is as follows. First, we claim that it is
IP-external; this captures the fact that its distribution differs from CP-external evidentials. As with the other evidentials, êtokwê introduces a discourselinked operator (OP) in its speciﬁer position. This yields the base structure
in (24), where êtokwê is positioned external to IP. As with quotative itwêand reportative êsa, dubitative êtokwê occurs in one of three positions relative to the clause it is associated with: in a right-peripheral position, in
second position, and in sentence-initial position. The relevant structures are
given in (25).

(25c) sentence-initial dubitative (cf. 23)
[EVIDP OP [EVID=DUBIT [êtokwê] [IP . . .]]]
One indication that dubitative êtokwê is IP-external is that it always
follows wh-words such as tânisi ‘how’, as in (26). Here the narrator infers
the owl has spirit-power based on a cultural belief about owls and because

she heard the dead owl hooting. We take the [wh < dubitative] order as
indicative of the IP-external position of êtokwê.17

‘what must have happened, I suppose, was that the owl had

(Whitecalf 1993:42, lines 28–29)
Our analysis of dubitative êtokwê as IP-external is supported by two other
kinds of data: (i ) its ordering relative to negation and (ii ) its co-occurrence
with CP-external evidentials.
2.4.1.2. Ordering of IP-external dubitative and negation. The relative
ordering of the dubitative and negation is consistent with the claim that dubitative êtokwê is IP-external, and also provides evidence that the dubitative
may sometimes be displaced. On independent grounds, Plains Cree negation
has been argued to be introduced in the CP layer (27a).18 We here propose
that dubitative êtokwê is IP-external (27b). Together these two claims predict
the ordering in (27c).
(27a) neg < cp
(27b) dubitative < ip
(27c) neg < dubitative < ip
Plains Cree has two forms of negation, namôya and êkâ, and the [neg < dubit] order is attested with both of them, as in (28). Though the negative occurs before the dubitative in these examples, it nevertheless takes narrow
scope, as shown by the unavailability of the ‘no doubt’ interpretation in
(28a–ii ) and (28b–ii ).19
17
If wh-words occupy Spec,CP, then the [wh < dubitative] order follows from our IPexternal analysis of dubitatives. However, if Plains Cree wh-questions are clefts of the form
‘who is it that . . .’ (Blain 1997), then the [wh < dubit] order would reﬂect the scope-taking
properties of the wh-expression. Many of Lacombe’s (1874b:62) examples show the dubitative
with a wh-phrase, usually tâni’si ‘how’; this use of the dubitative may be related to the Blackfoot nonafﬁrmative (Frantz 1991).
18
See Reinholtz (1999), Déchaine and Wolfart (1998; 2000), and Déchaine and Wiltschko
(2002; 2003).
19
Quechua evidentials likewise take scope over negation (Faller 2002:227). For Faller, negation is part of the proposition expressed, while evidential force is analyzed as a sincerity condition and thus cannot (in general) be negated.

In addition to the [neg < dubit] order, which is predicted by our analysis,
the [dubit < neg] order is also attested:

The [dubit < neg] order seems to be a counterexample to the claim that
dubitative êtokwê is IP-external. Given that neg is in the CP-domain, and
that êtokwê is IP-external, this predicts [neg < dubit], as in (30a). We suggest that [dubit < neg] is derived via movement of the dubitative to a
higher position, as in (30b).

evidential types

Positing dubitative movement to account for the [dubit < neg] order might
appear to be an ad hoc solution, but as we shall see, this is not an isolated
case. The interaction of the IP-external dubitative with other CP-external
evidentials suggests that dubitative movement can occur in those contexts
as well.
2.4.1.3. IP-external dubitative with CP-external evidentials. Our
analysis of dubitative êtokwê as IP-external predicts that it should be possible to embed the dubitative under quotative itwê- or reportative êsa.
Consider ﬁrst the embedding of dubitative êtokwê under quotative itwê-, as
illustrated in (31). In (31a), the narrator introduces her own thoughts as a
direct quotation, which itself contains a dubitative. In (31b), the dubitative
occurs as part of an adverbial expression that precedes quotative itwê-. The
old woman is sitting by the window when a stranger enters and starts telling
her about the fate of the Cree people. The community infers, based on this
evidence, that this woman must have had a vision. The narrator presents the
community’s inference via dubitative êtokwê.

(Ahenakew 2000:118, lines 12–13)
The embedding of dubitative êtokwê under reportative êsa is also attested.
In (32a), the narrator’s husband has a dream about how to make medicine.
At the time, the narrator’s brother-in-law (Austin) is in the hospital and his
sister is told about the medicine. Because Austin requests the medicine, the
narrator infers that Austin’s sister must have visited him in the hospital to tell
him about the medicine. (32b) is part of a story about a white woman who
accidentally falls headﬁrst into a garbage bin while hanging her clothes; the
narrator infers that she must have been doing her laundry.

Observe that even though the dubitative precedes the reportative in (32), it
is interpreted as being within the scope of the reportative, as evidenced by
the unavailability of the interpretations in (32a–ii ) and (32b–ii ). The sentence-initial positioning of dubitative êtokwê in (32a) presumably arises
from the same kind of dubitative movement discussed above in regard to
the [dubit < neg] order.
Taken together, (31) and (32) conﬁrm that IP-external dubitative êtokwê
can be contained within the domain of CP-external evidentials such as quotative itwê- and reportative êsa, as predicted by the present analysis.
2.4.1.4. The morphosyntax of the Plains Cree dubitative. Although
the dubitative in Modern Plains Cree is almost always realized as an independent particle in the form of êtokwê, there exists a corresponding afﬁxal
form (-okwê, -kwê, -tokê) which appears in the verb complex. The afﬁxal dubitative is no longer widely used in Modern Plains Cree. A partial paradigm
of the afﬁxal dubitative appears in (33).

The afﬁxal Plains Cree dubitative seems to have had the same semantic

temporally unrestricted. Representative examples are given in (34).

The fact that earlier forms of Plains Cree made more extensive use of the
afﬁxal form of the dubitative provides indirect support for our claim that
Modern Plains Cree êtokwê is IP-external. In particular, in light of the
clausal structure argued for in Déchaine (1999), the placement of the dubitative afﬁx is consistent with the claim that it is IP-external. On the basis of
the linearization of agreement afﬁxes, Déchaine (1999) proposes that the
verb-stem domain forms a phrasal IP constituent which is sandwiched between proclitic and enclitic agreement (35).
(35) [[[pers/conj= [IP] =pers/num] =num/obv]]
The proclitic position corresponds to person agreement in the independent
mode, and to the conjunct preﬁx in the conjunct mode.21 The ﬁrst enclitic
position corresponds to person/number agreement, while the second enclitic position corresponds to number/obviation agreement. The question
that arises is how the afﬁxal dubitative is integrated into this clausal structure. The partial paradigms provided by Wolfart (1973:44a) indicate that in

nal plural (*-wa:) occurs in the conjunct mode only. This distinction is reﬂected in Plains Cree, where (external) number/obviation agreement follows
the dubitative in the independent mode (37a), but (internal) number/obviation agreement precedes the dubitative in the conjunct mode (37b).

(37b) Plains Cree afﬁxal dubitative in conjunct mode
[[[[conj= [IP] =pers/num] =num/obv] =dubit]]
In contrast to the afﬁxal dubitative, which occurs within the verb complex,
the dubitative particle êtokwê occurs outside the verb complex and is introduced at the left edge of the clausal domain, as in (38).22

Plains Cree dubitative particle
[dubit [[[pers/conj= [IP] =pers/num] =num/obv]]]

Our analysis claims that, independent of its status as an afﬁx or an independent particle, both variants of the Plains Cree dubitative are IP-external.
This raises the question of whether one form of the Plains Cree dubitative
predates the other. At least in Modern Plains Cree, it is clear that the dubitative particles coexist along with the afﬁxal form, as indicated by Wolfart’s (1973:44b) observations:
êtokwê occurs very freely both with independent and conjunct order verbs, as
well as in non-verbal sentences. Statistical studies (cf. Wolfart and Pardo,
1972) show that êtokwê is exactly ten times more frequent in the Alberta texts
than in Bloomﬁeld’s texts. Stylistics, dialect differences, the time difference,
etc. undoubtedly must be taken into account in this matter. But the most interesting question, which has to remain completely open at the present time,
is whether there is an observable decline in the frequency of dubitative verb
forms which would correlate with the increasing frequency of the non-verbal
dubitative marker êtokwê.

The coexistence of the dubitative particle and the afﬁxal dubitative is not speciﬁc to Plains Cree. Historical evidence indicates that both have coexisted for
22
Consistent with the IP-external status of Plains Cree dubitative êtokwê, some speakers permit it in the pre-verb domain, as in (i ) below. This is consistent with the looser collocational
restrictions of the pre-stem position; see Wolfart (1973:76b, s7.52) for relevant discussion. In
the present analysis, the morphosyntactic structure of such examples would be as in (ii ).

a long time: both are reconstructed in Proto-Algonquian and so predate any
possible Cree development by two or three thousand years (D. Pentland, personal communication). This leads us to conclude that in Plains Cree (and also
in Proto-Algonquian), there are two ways of marking dubitative evidential
force: with a particle or an afﬁx. In Modern Plains Cree, the particle occurs
with greater frequency and its afﬁxal counterpart is no longer widely used.
2.4.2. Plains Cree nonfactual êska. The other IP-external evidential is
the nonfactual marker êska (or iska); it is associated with situations indicating that something is counter to fact or expectation, and typically expresses
the speaker’s surprise. Êska is an invariant particle, and whether it has any
temporal restrictions is unclear at this point. In (39), nonfactual êska is embedded inside quotative itwê-. The context is one in which the speaker is
expressing surprise that it is the dead owl which has been hooting.

that one which was hooting]. . . .
(Whitecalf 1993:42, lines 24–26)
To our knowledge, (39) is the only example of nonfactual êska that occurs
in the texts of Wolfart and Ahenakew (1998). Its occurrence seems to be extremely restricted in Modern Plains Cree usage. This single example does
not provide enough data for analysis except to say that nonfactual êska must
be occurring in an IP-external position since it may be embedded under quotative itwê-. We therefore position nonfactual êska in the same IP-external
domain as dubitative êtokwê. Although the evidence in support of this in
Plains Cree is moot, we shall see below that analyzing the nonfactual as IPexternal is consistent with its distribution in other dialects.
As discussed in James et al. (1998), in older forms of Plains Cree, nonfactual êska often co-occurs with verbs marked with the “subjective” sufﬁx
-wa, typically in contexts where a speaker is presenting a mental construct:23
23
Lacombe (1874b:61) refers to the subjective as the dubitatif suppositif (lit. “supposing dubitative”), as distinct from the dubitatif ordinaire (“ordinary dubitative” marked by -kwe) and
the dubitatif probable (lit. “dubitative of probability” marked by -kuban).

“The most basic use of the subjective form is to indicate that the assertion
is not being presented as something factual or true in the real world, but
instead as a mental construct of the speaker’s (or in an appropriate context it could be the mental construct of some person mentioned in the
sentence). . . . [T]he subjective form indicates how things seem or seemed to
the speaker (or to some person mentioned in the sentence)—it describes his
or her subjective perception or impression of how things are or were” (James
et al. 1998:2).
An example illustrating the co-occurrence of Plains Cree nonfactual êska
with subjective -wa is given in (40), where ‘arrive’ is inﬂected with the subjective. As discussed by James et al. (1998:2), in such examples the subjective conveys how the speaker views the state of affairs described without
making a commitment to the truth of the proposition.

(Lacombe 1874b:61; cited in James et al. 1998:7; 1999:5)
Across the Cree dialect continuum, the subjective form is typically used in
the narration of dreams (Ford 1979, Martin 1983, Baraby 1984, Drapeau
1986, and James et al. 1998). For example, for Plains Cree, Lacombe (1874b)
describes the subjective form as occurring in the narration of dreams and
nocturnal visions, as in (41).

‘Il le voit (dans une vision)’ / ‘He sees him (in a vision)’.

Note that the nonfactual marking occurs at the right periphery of the verb
complex, after the person/number enclitics, as shown in (42).

Plains Cree nonfactuals display a transitional pattern. In archaic Plains
Cree, although nonfactual êska and the subjective sufﬁx -wa often co-occur,
they are also attested independently of each other. Moreover, as James et al.
(1999) observe, the Plains Cree nonfactual particle êska is not part of the
verb complex, as evidenced by the fact that it may be separated from the verb
complex by intervening material. This is illustrated in (43), where the demonstrative ani[ma] ‘that’ intervenes between nonfactual êska and the verb
complex.

‘Il faut supposer qu’il est parti’ / ‘It seems that he has left’.
(Lacombe 1874b:61; cited by James et al. 1999:14)
Further reinforcing the independence of the nonfactual from the subjective sufﬁx is the fact that in Modern Plains Cree, the subjective sufﬁx is no
longer used, but the nonfactual continues to be attested (though rarely).
Based on these considerations, we posit the structures in (44) for Plains Cree
nonfactuals and subjective forms. In both archaic and modern Plains Cree,
nonfactual êska is IP-external. As for subjective -wa, for concreteness we
assume that it precedes number/obviation agreement.24

2.5. Summary of Plains Cree evidentials. We have proposed that Plains
Cree evidentials fall into two classes syntactically, according to whether they
are CP-external (quotative itwê- and reportative êsa) or IP-external (dubitative êtokwê and nonfactual êska). Morphosyntactically, Plains Cree evidentials are heterogeneous: some are verbs (the quotative), others are particles
(the reportative and the nonfactual), and yet others have a dual status as particles and afﬁxes (the dubitative). Semantically, Plains Cree evidentials
present perspectival information that indicates the speaker’s degree of commitment to the truth of what s/he is uttering, based on the evidence available.
The four Plains Cree evidentials treated so far may be further distinguished
according to whether the speaker has direct evidence for the event or situation being presented (quotative itwê-) or indirect evidence (reportative êsa,
dubitative êtokwê, nonfactual êska). These results are summarized in (45).
As we shall see immediately below, the contrast between direct and indirect
evidentials manifests itself differently in other Cree dialects.
24

This is the same position as the Plains Cree afﬁxal dubitative in the independent mode.

3. The heterogeneity of Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi evidentials. We
now turn to the evidential systems of the eastern varieties of Cree found in the
CMN complex. We begin by looking at CP-external quotatives as an instance
of direct evidentials (3.1). We then turn our attention to IP-external indirect
evidentials, examining their semantics (3.2) and their morphosyntax (3.3).
3.1. CP-external evidentials in Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi: quotatives. Quotatives in CMN are used to present evidence in historical and personal narratives. The CMN quotative is verbal, based on the stem it- ‘say’,
and it usually follows the clause it is construed with. Representative examples are given in (46).

ex. 8)
Quotatives in CMN and Plains Cree show a similar range of properties.
Semantically, quotatives in both CMN and Plains Cree present direct discourse. In terms of the perspectival information they introduce, the CMN
quotative differs slightly from its Plains Cree counterpart. According to
James et al. (1996:140; 2001:237), CMN quotative it- is used to present secondhand information (‘s/he said’) or thirdhand information (‘it is said’). As
such, the CMN quotative verb appears with third-person agreement. This
contrasts with Plains Cree quotative itwê- which, in addition to presenting
secondhand and thirdhand information, is also used to present the point of
view of speech act participants. Thus, the Plains Cree quotative may be inﬂected for any person value, i.e., ﬁrst, second, or third person. Morphosyntactically, both the CMN and the Plains Cree quotative have the status of
verbs; this correlates with the fact that their temporal value is unrestricted.
Syntactically, they are both CP-external. This is summarized in (47).

Thus, direct evidentials, in the form of the quotative, seem to exhibit the
same range of semantic and syntactic properties in CMN as they do in
Plains Cree.26 We now turn to indirect evidentials where, as we shall see,
there are signiﬁcant semantic and morphosyntactic differences across the
two dialect areas.

evidentials. CMN indirect evidentials seem to have undergone a semantic

Descriptions in the literature suggest that CMN quotatives are restricted to third-person
forms; for this reason, we classify the CMN quotative as [-speech act participant].
26
In Montagnais, as described by Drapeau (1986:191), in foregrounding contexts, nonembedded verbs can alternate between the dubitative and the indicative as a way of marking the
relative saliency of events. Given that the quotative verb is often nonembedded, this means that

realignment. Within the CMN complex, this plays out in two different ways,
with Montagnais/Naskapi exhibiting one pattern and East Cree exhibiting
another. What corresponds in Plains Cree to the contrast between dubitative
êtokwê and reportative êsa (48a) is in Montagnais/Naskapi a distinction between present (-tak) versus past (-shipan) indirect inferred evidence (48b).
As for the Plains Cree nonfactual (êska), it corresponds to the Montagnais/Naskapi subjective ((is)ka- . . . -ua). And in East Cree (48c), the contrast is between present (-tak) versus nonpresent (-shipan) indirect inferred
evidence. Notably, the East Cree nonpresent forms group together past
(-shipan) and nonfactual ((is)ka- . . . shapan-ua) indirect inferred evidence.

While Plains Cree reportative êsa is CP-external, the corresponding -shipan
forms in the eastern dialects are IP-external. This syntactic distinction has
semantic consequences: while CP-external reportative êsa has a past orientation (cf. 2.1.2 above), its eastern counterparts are past tense markers with
evidential force.27 The details of the semantic realignment differ in each dialect: while Montagnais/Naskapi has a tripartite division between present,
past, and subjective, East Cree has a bipartite division between present and
nonpresent (with the latter marked by either -shipan alone or in combination with subjective morphology). We begin by examining the historical
basis for the temporal realignment of CMN indirect evidentials (3.2.1) and
then consider their functions as reportatives (3.2.2), dubitatives (3.2.3), distantives (3.2.4), and nonfactuals (3.2.5).
in foregrounding contexts the quotative can be inﬂected with the dubitative, as in (i). According
to Drapeau, such forms function as a kind of historical present.

CMN -shipan parallels Quechua -sqa, which is analyzed by Faller (2003a) as a past tense
indirect evidential. Quechua -sqa functions as a reportative, marks indirect inference, indicates
surprise, and is used to report dreams (Howard-Malverde 1990 and Levinsohn 1991).

3.2.1. Historical basis for the temporal realignment of indirect
evidentials. We argue that the reportative/dubitative contrast (that still obtains in Plains Cree) has been reanalyzed in CMN along temporal lines. On
independent grounds, James et al. (1996; 2001) suggest that the past tense
orientation of CMN -shipan is attributable to the fact that it is a reﬂex of the
Proto-Algonquian reportative *-(e)sapan, which combines *-(e)san with the
preterit *-pan, as in (49a). We further speculate that the present tense orientation of CMN -tak is a temporal realignment of the dubitative, as in (49b).

The CMN indirect evidentials have collapsed the reportative/dubitative distinction and so occur across a wider range of semantic contexts than do
their Plains Cree reportative and dubitative counterparts. We illustrate this
in the following subsections.
3.2.2. Indirect evidentials with a reportative function. The use of the
past tense indirect evidential -shipan as a reportative is attested in both Sheshatshiu and Lower North Shore Montagnais. Consider ﬁrst the Sheshatshiu
examples in (50). In (50a), the indirect evidential -shipan is used as a past
tense reportative in response to the question, “Did Manitesh have a lot of
children?” In (50b), -shipan is used in a context where the speaker does not
have ﬁrsthand knowledge but is inferring the existence of a bird on the basis
of an observable result, reasoning, or a verbal report.

Similarly, in the Lower North Shore Montagnais example in (51), the
speaker has just been told by an interlocutor: “Have you heard the news? The
king has arrived.” The speaker then reports this news using -ha (< -hipan),
the past tense indirect evidential.

3.2.3. Indirect evidentials with a dubitative function. CMN indirect
evidentials also occur in contexts of inferred evidence (where Plains Cree
would use dubitative êtokwê). This is illustrated in (52) for the present tense
indirect evidential -tak, and in (53) for the past tense indirect evidential
-shipan.

their reportative and dubitative functions, CMN indirect evidentials are used
in contexts where a speaker is distant from the situation being described.

The use of indirect evidentials to mark the speaker’s distance from the situation may also be metaphorical, as in (55) where the past tense indirect
evidential -shipan is used to indicate that the speaker’s reﬂection in the
mirror is distinct from the speaker.

3.2.5. Indirect evidentials with a nonfactual function. The ﬁnal type
of indirect evidential to be considered is the nonfactual. Recall that in Plains
Cree, nonfactual êska is used to express surprise at an unexpected outcome.
In East Cree, nonfactuals are marked in the subjective form with the discontinuous afﬁx (is)ka- . . . -ua: and are typically used in dream contexts, as in
(56a). In (56b), we see a Naskapi subjective verb occurring in a context
where the narrator indicates that it seems he has been given a message, hence
the use of the (nonfactual) subjective form.

3.3. The morphosyntax of Cree/Montagnais/Naskapi indirect evidentials. In addition to the semantic differences in the deployment of indirect
evidentials across the Cree dialect continuum, another difference lies in the
fact that CMN indirect evidentials appear as afﬁxes within the verb complex,
while their Plains Cree counterparts are independent particles. Morphosyntactically, CMN indirect evidentials occur within the verb complex, preceding number/obviation agreement, as in (57). Observe that CMN indirect
evidentials are restricted to the independent mode.28

4. Conclusion. Across the Cree dialect continuum, CP-external evidentials include quotatives (in Plains Cree and CMN) and reportatives (in Plains
Cree) (58a). IP-external evidentials include dubitatives and nonfactuals (in
Plains Cree), as well as indirect evidentials (in CMN) (58b).

This survey of evidentials across the Cree dialect continuum leads to the
following conclusions. First, internal to Plains Cree, the afﬁxal dubitative is
now relatively rare, and the corresponding dubitative particle is more widely
attested (cf. Wolfart 1973). Second, for all Cree dialects, the quotative is
stable and is always realized as a verbal form.
Perhaps the most signiﬁcant ﬁnding is that indirect evidentials show considerable variation across the Cree dialect continuum. Morphosyntactically, CMN indirect evidentials are sufﬁxes inside the verb complex and are

28
This reverses the Proto-Algonquian pattern, where dubitative inﬂections can be unambiguously reconstructed in the conjunct but are less clearly reconstructed in the independent order
(D. Pentland, personal communication).

restricted to the independent order.29 In contrast, Plains Cree indirect evidentials—reportative êsa, dubitative êtokwê, and nonfactual êska—are independent particles and are mostly attested with the conjunct order, though
they may also occur with the independent order.30
Semantically, CMN indirect evidentials collapse the reportative, dubitative, and nonfactual functions, while Plains Cree assigns these functions to
three distinct morphemes. Thus, indirect evidentials have undergone temporal realignment in CMN and are consequently attested in a wider range of
contexts than their Plains Cree counterparts. This clariﬁes an otherwise puzzling difference in the semantic functions of evidentials in Cree dialects.
Finally, CMN indirect evidentials are used as “distantives,” a function that
is unattested in Plains Cree.
According to the Evidential Domain Hypothesis proposed here, while all
evidentials introduce speaker-oriented information, they fall into different
subclasses according to the syntactic position they occupy: CP-external,
IP-external, AspP-external, and vP-external. We have argued that Cree evidentials are of two types (CP-external and IP-external) and that individual
dialects show a predictable range of variation in how “indirect evidence” is
mapped onto CP versus IP domains.

This may be related to the observation that in eastern varieties of Cree, the independent
is used for backgrounding information, while the conjunct is used for foregrounding information (Cyr 1991 and Jancewicz 2000). The restriction of CMN indirect evidentials to the independent may indicate that the perspectival information coded by evidentials is background
information. Hockett (1958:556) observes that the independent can be used to mark direct quotations or parenthetical explanations in literary narratives.
30
Wolfart (1996:405) observes that Plains Cree dubitative forms “occur in both the independent and conjunct order.”
