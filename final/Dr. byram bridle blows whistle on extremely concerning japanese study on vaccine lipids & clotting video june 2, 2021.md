# Dr. Byram Bridle Blows Whistle On Extremely Concerning Japanese Study On Vaccine Lipids & Clotting [Video] [June 2, 2021] - Fact Check "Vaccine"

> ## Excerpt
> Dr. Byram Bridle exposes the Japanese study showing where the spike protein (synthetic mRNA) accumulates in the human body once it gets into the blood stream. This he says explains the reason we are seeing so many adverse reactions. What many people around the world already knew, this is genocide, we now have some solid scientific research to show the mechanism.

Dr. Byram Bridle exposes the [[Japanese]] study showing where the spike protein (synthetic m[[RNA]]) accumulates in the human body once it gets into the blood stream. This he says explains the reason we are seeing so many adverse reactions. What many people around the world already knew, this is genocide, we now have some solid scientific research to show the mechanism.

Dr. Bridle is an associate professor and viral immunologist in the Department of Pathobiology at the [[University]] of Guelph. His research interests include developing a better understanding of how the [[immune]] system responds to viral infections as well as designing immunotherapies for the [[treatment]] of cancers and infectious diseases.

Bridle, who was awarded a $230,000 grant by the [[[Canadian]] [[government]]](https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/ontario-gives-230k-in-[[vaccine]]-research-funding-to-university-of-guelph-1.4948998) last year for research on [[COVID]] [[vaccine]] development, said he and a group of international scientists filed a request for information from the [[Japanese]] regulatory agency to get access to [[Pfizer]]’s “[biodistribution study](https://www.docdroid.net/xq0Z8B0/pfizer-report-japanese-[[government]]-pdf).”

Biodistribution studies are used to determine where an injected compound travels in the body, and which tissues or organs it accumulates in.

“It’s the first time ever scientists have been privy to seeing where these messenger [[RNA]] \[m[[RNA]]\] [[vaccine]]s go after vaccination,” Bridle said in an interview with Alex Pierson where he first disclosed the data. “Is it a safe assumption that it stays in the shoulder muscle? The short answer is: absolutely not. It’s very disconcerting.”
