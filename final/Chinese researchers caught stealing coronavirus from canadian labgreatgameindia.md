One of [[Canada]]’s top scientists says he’s surprised and dismayed an “administrative matter” resulted in the sudden eviction of a prominent [[Chinese]] [[Canadian]] virologist, her biologist husband, and her students from [[Canada]]’s only level-4 lab in Winnipeg and [prompted an RCMP investigation](https://greatgameindia.com/canada-investigates-chinas-[[biological]]-espionage/).

![[[Chinese]] [[Research]]ers Caught Stealing Corona[[virus]] From [[Canadian]] Lab](https://i1.wp.com/greatgameindia.com/wp-content/uploads/[[2020]]/01/[[Chinese]]-[[Research]]ers-Caught-Stealing-Corona[[virus]]-From-[[Canadian]]-Lab-1024x706.jpg?resize=696%2C480&is-pending-load=1)![[[Chinese]] [[Research]]ers Caught Stealing Corona[[virus]] From [[Canadian]] Lab](https://i1.wp.com/greatgameindia.com/wp-content/uploads/[[2020]]/01/[[Chinese]]-[[Research]]ers-Caught-Stealing-Corona[[virus]]-From-[[Canadian]]-Lab-1024x706.jpg?resize=696%2C480)

Sources say [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/) and her husband Keding Cheng were escorted from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg on [[July]] 5. Since then, the [[University]] of [[[[Manitoba]]]] has ended their appointments, reassigned her graduate students, and cautioned staff, students and faculty about traveling to [[China]].

“I think it’s unfortunate. It’s all speculation. We have no idea what the investigation is about. The fact the RCMP is involved to me doesn’t mean anything at all, because they just need somebody external to their investigation,” said Gary Kobinger, professor in the Department of Microbiology and Infectious [[Disease]]s and director of the [[Research]] Centre on Infectious [[Disease]]s at Laval [[University]] in [[Quebec]].

Sources say [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/), biologist Keding Cheng, and an unknown number of Qiu’s students were escorted from the National Microbiology Lab (NML) and their security access revoked on [[July]] 5.

Qiu is head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program.

Kobinger said it’s procedure to escort someone from the building if they don’t have a security badge that allows them access.

The Public Health Agency of [[Canada]] (PHAC) will only confirm it referred an “administrative matter” involving a possible “policy breach” to the RCMP on [[May]] 24.

Neither PHAC nor the RCMP are providing further details, citing privacy concerns.

Meanwhile, the [[University]] of [[[[Manitoba]]]] has [suspended the appointments](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lab-researchers-nml-travel-1.52[[1498]]5) of both [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/) and Cheng and reassigned Qiu’s students, pending the [RCMP investigation](https://greatgameindia.com/canada-investigates-chinas-[[biological]]-espionage/).

Qiu, Cheng and the students all originally come from [[China]].

There has been speculation the case involves the improper [transfer of intellectual [[property]] or [[biological]] materials to [[China]]](https://greatgameindia.com/canada-investigates-chinas-[[biological]]-espionage/). The NML is [[Canada]]’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola.

However, Kobinger does not believe [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/) was involved in economic espionage.

“The [[Chinese]], do you see the [[science]] they’ve been generating in the past 5 years?” he asked, adding most of the research is published publicly.

“The [[Chinese]] – they have so many scientists, it’s unreal. What we can do in six months, they can do in a month. There is nothing, nothing, nothing that I can see from my side that they would benefit from us in terms of knowledge, in terms of re-agents,” Kobinger said. “They have better access to pathogens, everything else, the [[vaccine]], therapies, everything.”

He believes it may be a case of paperwork filled out incorrectly or the breach of a [[government]] policy created by bureaucrats who don’t understand how [[science]] works.

Or, he adds, it could be a question of mandate because the role of the lab has always been unclear – some say it should just do diagnostics while others believe it should do research.

Dr. Gary Kobinger, former chief of special pathogens (right), and Dr. [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/), research scientist (second from right) met with Dr. Kent Brantly and Dr. Linda Mobula, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the physician who administered ZMapp to Brantly in Liberia when he was infected with Ebola during the [[2014]]-16 outbreak. (Submitted by Health [[Canada]])

Until he left the NML three years ago, [Qui worked with Kobinger to develop ZMapp](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/ebola-survivor-from-west-africa-meets-winnipeg-researchers-who-developed-the-drug-that-saved-her-life-1.3625375), a [[treatment]] for Ebola that was successfully used during the outbreak in West [[Africa]] in [[2014]]-16. (The World Health Organization declared the latest Ebola outbreak a global health emergency last week.)

Kobinger and Qiu have been recognized for their work, including a Governor General’s Innovation Award in [[2018]].

Kobinger said he reached out to [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/) by email after hearing the news and she thanked him for his support.

He wishes PHAC could provide a little more information to settle the speculation going on internationally.

“\[Qiu’s\] body of work is solid. I don’t think it’s going to damage it. But her reputation, I think so, yeah,” Kobinger said in a phone interview.

“If I was in her place, I don’t know if I would ever go back. I would not,” Kobinger said. “So she can take the phone and find a lab anywhere in the world, tomorrow. People may not realize, when you are a top scientist, it’s not hard to move.”

Neither Qiu nor Cheng could be reached for comment.

All of this comes at a time when relations between [[Canada]] and [[China]] are strained.

Last [[December]], [[Canada]] arrested [[Chinese]] Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S warrant. In retaliation, [[China]] has arrested two [[Canadian]] men on espionage charges, [[sentenced]] a third to [[death]] for drug offenses, and shut down imports of [[Canadian]] canola and meat.

Kobinger hopes [Xiangguo Qiu](https://greatgameindia.com/dr-xiangguo-qiu-chinese-[[biological]]-warfare-agent/) and her team are not caught unfairly in the middle of a diplomatic dispute.

“Everyone benefits from working together, that’s the nature of [[science]]. Again, I think there is clearly other issues that are completely unrelated to scientific research,” he said.

This case has similarities to investigations in the U.S., where authorities have been investigating and warning about the danger of scientists and academics with [[Chinese]] connections sharing intellectual [[property]] and [[trade]] secrets with [[Beijing]]. Several have been forced from their positions at [[American]] universities and institutions.

The [[Canadian]] Security Intelligence Service and [[[NATO]] have also warned of state-sponsored espionag](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lab-researcher-rcmp-national-microbiology-lab-1.5212851)e.
