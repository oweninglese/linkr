Beyond the "Ecological

[[Indian]]": Environmental
Politics and Traditional

Ecological Knowledge in
Modern North America
Abstract
The idea of the ecological [[Indian]] dates back to at least
the early modern period in [[Europe]] and initial colonial en
counters between [[Europe]]ans and [[Native]] North [[American]]s.
In the minds of [[Europe]]ans, and later Euroamericans, the
ecological [[Indian]] represented a softly spoken "noble sav
age," a natural conservationist who was attuned to the
earth's rhythms. As the following essay reveals, this racial
trope remains alive and well in the modern [[history]] of North

America, inhibiting meaningful dialogue between [[white]]
[[American]]s and [[Indigenous]]/[[First]] [[Nations]] people on environ
mental issues and the rapid pace of global warming.
Through case studies of the Campo [[Indian]] Reservation in

Dakota, and [[Native]] [[American]] opposition to the construc

analysis of the environmental writings of [[Indigenous]] schol
ars and activists such as Deborah McGregor and Winona
LaDuke, this essay aims to advance historical and environ
mental discourses beyond racial stereotypes. The article also

seeks to encourage a deeper, serious, and more meaningful
engagement with [[Native]] [[American]] environmental knowl
edge and social practices to more effectively meet the envi
ronmental challenges confronting [[Native]] and non-[[Native]]
peoples alike in twenty-first-century North America.

INTRODUCTION
According to Kimberly Tallbear (Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate of South
Dakota), the so-called ecological [[Indian]] remains alive and well in
twenty-first-century America. Tallbear observes that [[white]] environ
mentalists routinely draw on racial stereotypes that depict [[Native]]
[[American]]s as "soft-spoken" people who reject "the [[white]] man's laws
and practices" and remain loyal to "traditional" land and water use
patterns.1 In recent decades, the referencing of "authentic [[Indian]]s"

and "uncontaminated" [[Indigenous]] knowledge has tended to mute

the voices of [[Native]] [[American]] people on issues of ecological sustain
ability and the rapidity with which [[climate]] warming is altering biota
and ecosystems.2
This essay aims to move beyond the racial stereotypes identified by
Tallbear. It does so by incorporating brief case studies of the Campo
[[Indian]] Reservation in southern [[California]], the Pine Ridge Reservation
in South Dakota, and [[Native]] [[American]] opposition to the construction
of oil pipelines through tribal lands to illuminate how racial stereo

types about ecological [[Indian]]s continues to hamper [[Indigenous]] ef

forts to exercise territorial [[sovereignty]] effectively and implement
environmental policies deemed to be in the best interests of [[Native]]
communities. The essay also analyzes the scholarship and activism of

two Anishinaabe women on opposite sides of the US-[[Canadian]] bor

der to reveal how traditional ecological knowledge (or TEK) can have

both local applications and transnational implications.3 Deborah

McGregor (Anishinaabe, Whitefish River [[First]] Nation in [[Ontario]]) and
Winona LaDuke (Anishinaabe of the White Earth Reservation in
Minnesota) have made significant contributions to scholarly and po

litical discussions about resource sustainability and ecological man
agement practices. Their intellectual work and activism has also

sought ways to [[foster]] economic self-sufficiency and sustainable agri
cultural practices, in addition to resisting the exploitative practices of
corporations engaged in oil, gas, and coal extraction on [[Native]] lands.

The work of McGregor and LaDuke highlights how TEK is a

transnational force that guides [[Native]] and [[First]] Nation spokespeople

in articulating approaches to resource management and ecological

sustainability.
Late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century [[Native]] [[American]] en
vironmental activism and knowledge systems are not born out of the

racial stereotypes associated with the ecological [[Indian]]. Instead,
[[Indigenous]] ecological knowledge is the product of an ecological
awareness that is historical, spiritual, and political in nature. This

awareness is dynamic in character, providing a framework for under
standing [[Native]] [[American]] insights into how to meet the challenges

of global environmental change in the twenty-first century.

Significantly, the writings of McGregor and LaDuke, and the experi

ences of [[Indigenous]] people at the Campo and Pine Ridge

Reservations, reveal how [[Native]] [[American]] ecological awareness inter
sects with the economics and politics of neo[[colonialism]] in modern

North America.

This ecological awareness is grounded by TEK. While [[Native]] schol
ars and activists have long striven to articulate and apply traditional
knowledge in their respective communities, it has only been since
the late [[1980]]s that the broader scholarly community has begun to in
corporate TEK into environmental studies.4 For [[Indigenous]] scholars
and environmental activist like Deborah McGregor, TEK acquires its
contemporary meaning within the context of [[Indigenous]] cultural re
vival movements of the late twentieth century. McGregor notes that
these movements center on a cooperative ethos for resource manage
ment and conservation. TEK, as the following analysis reveals, is a
source for [[Native]] empowerment that allows communities to "re
claim traditional values and practices," undermine racial stereotypes
about ecological [[Indian]]s, and elevate [[Indigenous]] voices in negotia
tions with Euroamerican [[government]]s—especially in the [[United]]
[[States]] and [[Canada]]—on issues such as resource management and envi
ronmental sustainability.5

DEFINING THE "ECOLOGICAL INDIAN"
The modern ecological [[Indian]] idea has its antecedents in the imagi
nations of [[Europe]]ans and Euroamericans from the late fifteenth cen
tury. It was a product of a relational [[history]] in which [[Europe]]ans and
Euroamerican [[trade]]rs, missionaries, and settlers believed their civili

zation was socially and culturally more advanced than the civiliza
tions nurtured by North America's [[Native]] peoples.6 By the eighteenth

and nineteenth centuries, [[Europe]]ans and Euroamericans focused

their mythologizing on "noble" ecological [[Indian]]s living in harmony
with nature as a way to highlight how [[Western]] civilizations had pro

duced spiritually broken people—societies of isolated individuals

who had become overly materialistic. In contrast, [[Europe]]ans and
Euroamericans imagined [[Native]] [[American]]s as transhistorical figures
possessing nurturing feminine qualities that allowed them to remain
connected to the rhythms of the natural environment, thereby an
choring an emotive spirituality thought to be long extinguished in

the [[white]] man's soul.

The cultural, economic, and political structures that people of
[[Europe]]an descent brought to the [[New]] World—[[trade]], Christianity,
centralized [[government]]s, technological inventiveness, and the devel
opment of capitalism—coexisted alongside the nurturing of romantic
images of the so-called ecological [[Indian]] and the noble savage living
on "vacant soyle."7 A long list of [[Europe]]an intellectuals and writers
such as John Dryden, Thomas [[Southern]]e, Aphra Behn, Charles-Louis
Montesquieu, Garbielle Mably, Guillaume-Thomas Raynal, and Denis
Diderot, used the imagery of the "noble savage" to question the
morality of [[Europe]]an [[colonialism]] in the [[New]] World.8 These writers
routinely emphasized the duality of masculine civilization and sim
ple-minded, yet effeminate, [[Indigenous]] societies, a binary that re

ceived its most forceful articulation in Rousseau's A Discourse on the

Origin of Inequality ([[1755]]) and his exploration of "savage man."9
Many fine works of scholarship explore how Euroamerican writer
musicians, and playwrights adapted Rousseau's conceptualization of

the "savage man" in the two centuries after the publication of his
Discourse.10 It is not my intention here to revisit the arguments
made by Rousseau scholars. Suffice it to say that Rousseau was not
writing specifically about [[Native]] [[American]]s; however, Rousseau's

"savage man" ultimately provided [[Europe]]an and Euroamerican

writers, playwrights, and songwriters with a ready language to craft

the imagery of the prototypical [[Native]] [[American]]—the "noble sav
age." From the earliest years of the [[American]] republic, we see the

transformation of Rousseau's "savage men" in, for example, the

story of Samson Occom (Mohegan). Occom was the most famous
eighteenth-century [[Native]] [[American]] to emerge in [[New]] England soci

ety. A convert to Christianity, he helped to spread Christianity

through his writings and his leadership of the Brothertown move
ment. But when missionaries first encountered Occom, he appeared
as the prototype of the ecological [[Indian]] and "noble savage." Occom
reportedly lived simply, resided in a wigwam—its materials being

"the simple Product of nature."11 Alternatively, the eighteenth

century literature, theater, and opera, such as Julia Kemble Hatton's
Tammany, A Serious Opera ([[1794]]), turned out cultural productions

that reified the ecological [[Indian]] and "noble savage" in [[American]]

culture.12

By the nineteenth century, the so-called noble savage had become
a fixture in [[American]] popular culture. Among the most in[[flu]]ential lit
erary figures to craft narratives about noble savages in the [[American]]
wilderness were James Fenimore Cooper and Henry David Thoreau.13

Cooper and Thoreau typified the transcendental and sentimental

tenor of [[American]] literature during the antebellum era.
Transcendentalists, who believed that individuals possessed an "in
dwelling" God and should act on intuitive thought, wrote "sentimen
tal" prose that emphasized feeling over empirical logic. The [[American]]
[[Indian]]—in the form of either the "noble savage" or his literary exten
sion, the ecological [[Indian]]—were blessed with these emotional and
spiritual qualities, qualities that were routinely feminized. Henry

Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem Hiawatha ([[1855]]) portrayed

[[Native]] [[American]]s with the spiritual and emotional qualities that tran
scendentalists and romantic writers longed for. Longfellow's [[Indian]]s
were thus men of action, equipped with the keenest of instincts.14 In
[[1857]] Ralph Waldo Emerson lamented that the excesses of "civilized"

and "industrialized" [[American]] society had all but extinguished the
ideal of "primitivism." For Emerson, the [[Indian]] was passing from the
world's stage and would eventually become extinct. All the more rea
son, he felt, for [[white]] men to comprehend the [[Indian]]'s knowledge of
the natural world, a knowledge that the "civilized" man had lost.15
"An [[Indian]] has his knowledge for use," Emerson wrote approvingly,
"and it only appears in use. Most [[white]] men that we know have theirs
for talking purposes."16

The historical portrayal of ecological [[Indian]]s and noble savages

[[Indian]] ([[1999]]). Krech's analysis renewed both scholarly and popular

interest in the ecological [[Indian]]. His objective was to test the validity
of the mythology against what he considered to be the empirical real
ity of environmental [[history]] in North America. Krech interrogated
the idea of "the [[Indian]] in nature who understands the systemic con
sequences of his actions, feels deep sympathy with all living forms,
and takes steps to conserve so that the earth's harmonies are never

imbalanced and resources never in doubt."19 Krech thus began his

analysis with a romantically overdrawn, ahistorical image of an un
changing "[[Indian]]." From this starting point Krech developed the bi
nary ecological [[Indian]], one good, or "noble," the other "ignoble," or

bad.20 He found no evidence to support the assertion that "the

[[American]] [[Indian]] is a nonpolluting ecologist, conservationist, and en
vironmentalist, and that the [[white]] man is not."21 Moreover, Krech

concluded that pre-Columbian [[Native]] [[American]]s were unable to

maintain a sustainable balance between human society and nature.
Krech thus found no empirical evidence to support the idea that "the

[[Indian]] in nature" understood the "consequences of his actions" or

felt a "deep sympathy for all living forms."22

Since the publication of Krech's The Ecological [[Indian]], scholars have
addressed both the content of his argument and reengaged with the
trope of the ecological [[Indian]]. This scholarship has often been punc
tuated with highly charged rhetoric.23 Darren Ranco, for example,
criticized Krech not only for his simplistic use of racial stereotypes,
criticism of [[Native]] cultures, and silence on issues like territorial sover
eignty, but for the way Krech's analysis is "grievously disengaged

from the contemporary issues of [[Indian]] communities."24 Ranco's

larger criticism of Krech's analysis is a valid one: Krech took the posi
tion of the "casual, and distant, critic." As Ranco suggests, this was
the type of position taken by ethnographers and anthropologists for
much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, a position that in
variably led non-[[Indigenous]] scholars to pass judgments on what was,
and was not, "authentic" [[Indian]] culture and behavior.25 Ranco thus

reminds us that the imagery associated with the ecological [[Indian]]
tends to be an overly contrived cultural construction that slides into
the realm of imposed racial stereotypes and reinforces a binary that
artificially distinguishes between the ecologically aware [[Indian]] and
the ecologically destructive [[Native]].

Commenting on this binary, Melissa Nelson (Turtle Mountain
Band of Chippewa) observes that conceptualizing [[Native]] [[American]]s
as "either simple, pure, and in tune with nature, or savage, selfish,
and harmful to the land" highlights a "conspicuous lack of under
standing of the diversity and humanness of [[Native]] [[American]]s."26
Nelson offers more than simply a rebuttal of the stereotypes ascribed
to the ecological [[Indian]]; she draws our attention to the ways in which
TEK is "making significant contributions in a variety of scientific and

environmental fields." Nelson observes that [[Indigenous]] scientists
and educators have successfully woven TEK into the broader fabric of
ecological knowledge and public policy debates. [[Indigenous]] scientists
and educators like Gregory Cajete (Santa Clara Pueblo), Leroy Little
Bear (Blood Tribe of the Blackfoot Confederacy), and Winona LaDuke
have proven in[[flu]]ential in this respect.27 Building on the insights of
these [[Native]] writers, Nelson is at pains to emphasize how the coman
agement of natural resources by [[Native]] and [[Western]] scientists has
in[[flu]]enced the application of TEK by non[[government]]al organizations
in colonized environments from [[Australia]] to [[Alaska]].28 Applying TEK
in a world in which technology continues to change how humans in
teract with the environment and in which racial stereotypes about

noble and ignoble ecological [[Indian]]s persist remains a very real

challenge.29

hew recent cases empnasize tne complex interplay among [[science]]

and technology, TEK, tribal [[sovereignty]], and racial perceptions than
the Campo Landfill case in southern [[California]].30 At the beginning of
the [[1990]]s, the Campo Band of Mission [[Indian]]s declared their inten
tion to construct a solid waste landfill on their reservation, located
approximately one mile from the [[Mexican]] border. Campo leaders in
sisted that the landfill would be state of the art, an assurance designed
to assuage critics that the landfill would not contaminate a nearby

aquifer.31 The [[battle]] against the Campo landfill united farmers,

ranchers, and local environmental groups, most notably Backcountry
Against Dumps (BAD), organized by Donna Tisdale. This unlikely tri
umvirate produced some passionate pleas against the proposed land

fill, in addition to some stunningly vitriolic attacks on Campo

leaders. For example, Arol Wulf, a farmer and member of BAD, con
tended that the "[[Indian]]s are trying to ruin our land." Wulf added, "a
dump is against what [[Indian]]s have always stood for."32 Wulf was not
alone in expressing these views. Another farmer told a [[New]] York
Times reporter, "We are going to keep the land from being destroyed

by the [[Indian]]s." Ralph Goff, the Campo tribal chairman, rejected
such statements. While Goff publicly acknowledged the financial

benefits of the landfill to the Campo people, he maintained that "it is
a sound project," and "environmentally it can be done safely." Goff's
supporters and lawyers agreed, criticizing environmental activists for
showing a lack of respect for [[Indian]] [[sovereignty]] and implying that
[[Native]] [[American]]s were incapable of overseeing the construction of
an environmentally sound waste management system.33
After a drawn-out political and legal [[battle]], the secretary of the in
terior agreed with Goff. Plans for the landfill's construction were ap
proved in 1993.34 What the debate over the landfill exposed was how
local [[white]] farmers, ranchers, and environmentalists insisted that
they knew what "authentic" [[Indian]]s would do when presented with

the possibility of constructing a solid waste landfill on their

reservation. In his analysis of the Campo landfill controversy, Dan
McGovern wrote that the decisions [[Native]] peoples make about land
use practices sometimes contradicts the "conventional wisdom of
[[white]] [[American]]s" who imagine [[Native]] [[American]]s living in "harmony
with their environment."35 Opponents of the Campo landfill may
have been well intentioned, but their opposition to the Campo's deci
sion was predicated on the same uncritical use of [[Western]] stereotypes
that Krech also fell victim to in his analysis of the ecological [[Indian]].36

By imagining "authentic" [[Indian]]s living in a timeless past, Campo
landfill opponents constructed ignoble ecological [[Indian]]s who

seemed willing to pollute the environment in return for substantial fi

nancial remuneration. In this way, these [[white]] opponents failed to
see beyond their own prejudices.

MOVING BEYOND THE "ECOLOGICAL INDIAN'

The controversy surrounding the Campo landfill is but one of ma
examples that highlights how the imagery of the ecological Ind
continues to inform public discourse about [[Native]] [[American]] and e

vironmental issues.37 A common feature of the trope of the ecolog
[[Indian]] remains the idea that authentic [[Indian]]s live in harmony wi

nature and have an environmentally neutral impact on local ec

gies. In contrast, [[Native]] [[American]] people and communities that do
not behave according to prescribed racial stereotypes are too easily
dismissed as inauthentic and environmentally destructive, just as
critics upbraided the Campo [[Indian]]s for approving the construction
of a landfill on their reservation. In other words, [[Indigenous]] "authen
ticity" remains a part of the colonial and racial matrix of US colonial
ism and contemporary environmental politics.38
Since World [[War]] II, the colonial and racial matrix has been concep
tualized in the public imagination by pop culture representations of
so-called real [[Indian]]s. Movies have played a major role in this popular
imagining of authentic [[Indian]]s, but so too has the [[Native]] tourist in

dustry contributed to a historical imagery.39 In Cherokee, North
Carolina, for example, the Oconaluftee [[Indian]] Village promises visi
tors a snapshot of "authentic" Cherokee life, just as it was eleven
thousand years ago. This living [[history]] attraction, located in the

Smoky Mountains, provides tourists with a view into one version of
Cherokee [[history]] before they get into their cars to spend a few hours

with nature in the nearby Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Thus the visual and oral narratives that tourists encounter at the

Oconaluftee [[Indian]] Village overlap with what tourist brochures to
as the unspoiled beauty of the Smoky Mountains National Park.40
There is, however, a tension in all this, one born of the endurin

impact of US [[colonialism]] and of how Euroamerican perceptions

"authentic" versus "assimilated" [[Indian]]s, and the "natural" as op
posed to the "manmade" environment, continue to shape cultural

and historical perceptions. But these issues are not meant to crowd
the thoughts of tourists who leave these types of attractions and
return to their suburban homes with the storyline of [[Indian]]s living
simple and ecologically aware lives intact.41
The traditional, authentic, and ecological [[Indian]] as a figure of con
sumer consumption and tourist entertainment contributes to how
[[white]] [[American]]s frame political and economic questions about tribal
[[sovereignty]], [[Indigenous]] economic self-sufficiency and agricultural
production, and political debates about environmental sustainability.
Melissa Nelson highlights these issues when she writes of how
[[American]] [[colonialism]] continues to have an impact on [[Native]]
[[American]] communities. She argues, "Ongoing cultural genocide per
sists every time [[Indian]]s are denied religious freedom, federal recogni
tion, [[treaty]] rights, a 'seat at the table,' and other fundamental
rights."42 For [[Native]] [[American]] activists, such is the case with contem
porary political, legal, and economic issues related to tribal sover
eignty, agriculture, and environmental protections.
Thus enduring storylines associated with the ecological [[Indian]]
make it possible for twenty-first-century [[American]]s to divert their
attention away from the socioeconomic and legal structures of

modern-day [[colonialism]]. This has become increasingly apparent to
[[Native]] [[American]] environmental activists. Since the passage of the
[[Indian]] Civil Rights Act in [[1968]] (an act that [[Indian]] activists note has
actually eroded tribal autonomy) and the end of the termination pol
icy, [[Native]] [[American]] environmental activism has done much to chal

lenge racial stereotypes and cultural clichés about [[Indigenous]]

peoples. [[Native]] environmental activists have therefore become vocal
and sophisticated in critiquing the federal [[government]]'s [[Indian]] pol
icy. In particular, [[Native]] environmental activists have played an im
portant role in spotlighting the collusion between [[government]] and

corporations. In the contemporary neocolonial context, this collu

sion has involved [[government]]s working to make it possible for multi

national corporations to sidestep issues of tribal [[sovereignty]] and

extract natural resources from tribal lands. Federally backed subsidies
for major oil [[companies]] and legislative approval for hacking are just
two of myriad examples of how [[Native]] [[American]] environmental ac
tivists are able to connect the defense of tribal [[sovereignty]] with issues
of ecological sustainability.43
While [[Native]] [[American]] activists address these issues in relation to

their respective local communities, [[Indigenous]] activists and commu
nity leaders are not blind to the broader implications of the tribal sov

ereignty-environmentalism dynamic. For example, Gwich'in leade
Sarah James has written about the "very real threat" posed by globa

warming.44 James does not mince her words, emphasizing a basic

truth: "Too much waste and greed" has over the past century changed
the environment and warmed the earth's atmosphere. Her solution
rests on a simple principle: "We have to give up some things in order
to balance the environment. We must learn to share more, to reuse,
recycle, and use less energy."45 James lays no claim to possessing in
nate spiritual insights into the earth's ecologies. She is, however, con

scious that human behavior has changed the global environment,

thus necessitating modifications in that behavior.
In acknowledging the impact that human beings have on the envi
ronment, [[Native]] [[American]]s have not lost sight of the spiritual impor

tance of land and water in [[Indigenous]] culture. Gail Small
(Cheyenne), for example, acknowledges that there "is a profound
spiritual dimension to our natural environment." This acknowledg
ment, however, should not be seen as acceptance of the ecological
[[Indian]] trope and of so-called authentic [[Native]] women doing things
the "old-fashioned way."46 Small is clear on this, stating, "Some

[[white]] people look to us for help in their struggle with loss of identity,
spirituality, and a sense of security. Unfortunately, we can't give that
to them. They need to find it within themselves and their own cul
tures. When they try to appropriate tribal cultures, they have a nega
tive impact on our culture and alienate themselves even more from
their own ability to be centered."47

These women defy stereotypes. They are not, as the ecological
[[Indian]] motif emphasizes, passive observers of social, political, and en
vironmental change, dutifully playing the role of the soft-spoken and
spiritual [[Indian]]. Instead, their words and activism highlight how is

sues of [[American]] neo[[colonialism]], tribal [[sovereignty]], and environ
mental change are intertwined in [[Native]] [[American]] political

consciousness. To borrow from Donna Barbie, these women chal

lenge Euroamericans to "give up satisfying legends" about [[Native]]
[[American]]s and to start seeing (and negotiating with) [[Indigenous]]
[[American]]s as real human beings.48 They are, in other words, active
political agents working to nurture families, communities, and
ecosystems.

At the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, local concerns

about these types of issues highlight how a generation of Oglala

Sioux people has worked to [[foster]] agricultural development, cultural
renewal, and a historical understanding of [[colonialism]]'s ongoing leg
acy. Debra White Plume (Lakota), a writer and activist, and her hus
band, Alex White Plume (Lakota), have played leading roles in trying
to stimulate both the economy of the Pine Ridge Reservation and re
minding its residents of their Lakota traditions. One of the most mov

ing examples of this awareness of [[colonialism]]'s enduring impact

came in [[1991]] when the White Plumes led efforts to return the re

mains of Zintkala Nuni, one of the few [[Indigenous]] survivors of the
Battle of Wounded Knee, to South Dakota from an unmarked grave
in [[California]].49

The White Plumes have actively engaged with the ongoing legacy
of [[colonialism]] for several decades. Debra White Plume, for instance,
has used her Sacred Shawl Women's Society to support victims of do
mestic [[violence]], a problem that Reservation life, itself a product of co
lonial policy and practice, exacerbates. She has also endeavored to

find solutions to the chronic levels of unemployment on the Pine
Ridge Reservation. "We have over 16,000 able-bo[[died]] people in the
workforce," White Plume has stated of the Pine Ridge Reservation,
"and we have less than 3,000 jobs."50
In [[July]] [[1998]], the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council voted on a plan that
members hoped would address the chronic levels of unemployment
at Pine Ridge. The Tribal Council agreed to support a proposal to
grow industrial hemp on its sovereign lands. Industrial hemp is
grown in over thirty countries including the [[United]] [[States]]. It also has
a [[history]] of cultivation in North America that includes its production
on George [[Washington]]'s plantation and use by the Henry Ford Motor

Company to manufacture plastic for its automobiles.51 Industrial

hemp is a variety of Cannabis sativa L. Varieties of the plant with a tet

rahydrocannabinol (THC) ratio of greater than 1 percent are com

monly used to produce marijuana. Industrial hemp, by contrast, has
a THC ratio of less than 1 percent, usually around 0.3 percent. Put

simply, industrial hemp has no hallucinogenic qualities. Armed with

this knowledge, and following the Tribal Council's decision, the
White Plume family planted their first hemp crop in [[2000]]. By
[[November]] [[2001]], the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and
armed [[FBI]] agents—one of whom held a submachine gun at the un

armed Alex White Plume's face—responded. Failing to draw a distinc

tion between industrial hemp and the cultivation of marijuana,

federal agents entered the Pine Ridge Reservation and destroyed the
hemp crop.52

The White Plume family viewed the cultivation of industrial
hemp as the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council did: as an environmentally
sustainable way to revive the reservation's economy. Previous to this
decision, the Oglala Sioux at Pine Ridge Reservation relied on federal
[[government]] subsidies, the growing of corn and barley, and the raising

of horses to eke out a modest standard of living. The decision to
cultivate industrial hemp aimed to address [[poverty]] and to remedy
unemployment. Despite those intentions, the DEA opposed the
cultivation of industrial hemp at Pine Ridge. It cited a [[1968]] federal
law that prohibits the cultivation of cannabis-related [[crops]], [[crops]]
assumed to have hallucinogenic qualities.53 While most experts
reject the idea that industrial hemp has mind-altering properties,
the larger issues that this case exposed relate to how tribal sover
eignty was attacked because the Oglala Sioux exercised its political
authority in a way that ran counter to the federal [[government]]'s
vision for agricultural production on [[Indian]] reservations. Put another
way, federal officials appeared to believe that the Oglala Sioux were
acting in ways that ran counter to stereotypes about how ecological
[[Indian]]s should behave. Tribal Council responded to the DEA's
intrusion to its [[sovereignty]] by pointing to the hypocrisy of federal
Dolicv54

As was the case in the Campo landfill controversy in [[California]], the

events at Pine Ridge were by no means isolated examples of

[[Indigenous]] [[sovereignty]] being questioned or undermined during the
late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. During the first decade
and a half of the twenty-first century, the proposed construction of

the Keystone XL Pipeline has constituted the most significant chal
lenge to tribal land and water resources, and tribal [[sovereignty]]. The
proposed pipeline aims to connect the Alberta tar sands to refineries
in the Gulf of [[Mexico]]. The White Plumes reject the idea that the pipe
line will help to secure energy independence for the [[United]] [[States]]
and instead see the potential for catastrophic pollution of tribal lands
and further encroachments on tribal [[sovereignty]]. They have therefore
led opposition to the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and

the transportation of tar sands oil by truck through tribal lands.

Feeling pressure from voters who demand cheaper gasoline and heat
ing oil, federal and state politicians have seized on the Keystone XL

Pipeline debate as a means of galvanizing support from their respec
tive political bases. In [[April]] [[2012]], for example, Republican Party presi
dential hopeful Mitt Romney declared his determination to construct
the Keystone XL Pipeline. In contrast to the Obama administration,

which initially rejected a proposal by Trans[[Canada]] to build the

1,700-mile pipeline, Romney insisted that the pipeline would become

a reality if he was elected president, "even if I have to build it
myself."55

Romney's comments came just months before the [[Canadian]]-Based
oil giant Enbridge Inc. was forced to pay a fine of $3.7 million for a
[[2010]] malfunction in its pipeline, a catastrophic failure that resulted
in 20,000 barrels of crude oil being spilled into the Kalamazoo River
system in Michigan.56 For [[Native]] [[American]] environmental activists,
the fine was a pyrrhic victory. In [[[[protest]]s]] that looked strikingly simi

lar to those directed against the construction of the Keystone XL
Pipeline, tribal groups such as the Minnesota Chippewa petitioned

against the construction of Enbridge's pipeline.57 To the detriment of
the wetlands, river systems, and ecosystems that [[Native]] [[American]]s
shared (and continue to share) with [[white]]s in Minnesota, Wisconsin,
and Michigan, the pipeline was built despite tribal leaders, farmers,
and environmentalists forewarning of potential environmental

disaster.

At ri ne Ridge, [[[[protest]]s]] over the proposed construction ot the

Keystone XL Pipeline and the use of trucks to transport tar sands oil
through tribal lands mirror activism directed against the Enbridge

pipeline. These [[[[protest]]s]] have resulted in arrests. In [[March]] [[2012]],

Debra and Alex White Plume led a blockade against trucks attempting

to transport tar sands oil through the Pine Ridge Reservation.

Debra White Plume insisted that drivers tried to sneak the trucks

through Lakota lands without a permit from the Tribal Council.
For her efforts, White Plume was arrested. After being released from

[[jail]] she issued a statement, saying, "We stood our ground for our

land, our [[treaty]] rights, our human rights to clean drinking water and

our coming generations. We did this in solidarity with the [[First]]
[[Nations]] people in [[Canada]] who are being [[kill]]ed by the tar sands oil
mine, which is so big it can be seen from outer space; it is as big as
the state of Florida."58 Debra White Plume did not invoke the
trope of the ecological [[Indian]] to justify her actions to halt the
transportation of tar sands oil and equipment needed to construct
the Keystone XL Pipeline through Lakota land. Instead, White
Plume's opposition was based on a determined effort to resist the
excesses of corporate [[colonialism]] in twenty-first-century America, a
form of neo[[colonialism]] that not only seeks quietly to undermine
tribal [[sovereignty]], but to engage in practices that risk polluting the
land and water systems that the Lakota rely on for economic, politi
cal, and spiritual life.59

'TRADITIONAL" KNOWLEDGE IN THE

'MODERN" WORLD

The interconnectedness of tribal [[sovereignty]], sustainable agricult
and ecological responsibility that the White Plumes have emphasi
throughout their lives has also defined [[Indigenous]] environmenta
tivism since the [[1970]]s. At a local, national, and international level,
[[Indigenous]] women have been particularly effective in articulating
statements on [[climate]] change and identifying potential solutions.

For example, the Rural and [[Indigenous]] Women's Statement on

Climate Change, which included [[Indigenous]] signatories from around
the world, identified how "free market chauvinism facilitated by the

World Trade Organization and international and regional financial

institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank, and the Asian Development Bank, have led to the relentless ex
ploitation and exhaustion of natural resources, destruction of forest
and water sources in developing countries resulting in more carbon
emissions." Such impacts, which have had particularly negative con

sequences for "marginalized rural and [[indigenous]] communities,"
have been the focus of [[Indigenous]] women's written submissions to
the [[United]] [[Nations]].60 To address the environmental challenges iden
tified in such statements, [[Native]] activists, political leaders, and writ
ers insist on the important role that women can play. For instance,
The Manukan Declaration of the [[Indigenous]] Women's Biodiversity
Network declares that "[[Indigenous]] women have a vital role to play in
the protection and conservation of the biodiversity in distinct ecosys
tems including forests, arid and semi-arid lands, inland waters,
oceans and coasts and mountains."61

Such statements reflect the active ways in which [[Indigenous]]
women have tackled the complex issues associated with rapid global
[[climate]] change.62 Two Anishinaabe women, Deborah McGregor and
Winona LaDuke (who uses the plural of Anishinaabe, "Anishinabeg,"
in her writings), have been among the most articulate voices in set

ting out the positions of [[Indigenous]] women in local, national, and

international debates about environmental change.63 McGregor, for
example, is clear in her position that the "Uncritical belief in [[Western]]
[[science]] and technology as the only valid approach to resolving envi
ronmental problems has fallen by the wayside." In making her case
for the efficacy of [[Native]] knowledge, McGregor insists, "[[Science]] and
technology, at least on their own, cannot get us out of the situation
we are now in."64

McGregor has acknowledged that [[Native]] environmental knowl
edge, often referred to as TEK, is itself a construct of [[Western]] intellec

tual discourses. Concepts like environmental and ecological

constitute reductionist terms of analysis common in [[Western]] scien
tific thought. As McGregor points out, [[Native]] people often perceive

Beyond the Ecological [[Indian]] | 99

the separation of human beings and environment into discrete con

ceptual categories as anathema to "the rest of everyday living."65

Thus McGregor notes that TEK does not constitute a homogeneous

body of thought; rather it is a fragmented body of knowledge
"derived from the framework of the dominant society."66
That said, two important themes run through McGregor's writings.
[[First]], she views TEK as a critical component of [[Indigenous]] cultural re

vivals over the past half century, and second, she emphasizes how
[[Native]] women are playing an active role in counteracting the ways in

which neocolonial cultures devalue [[Indigenous]] knowledge for "sus
taining Creation." Like Gregory Cajete, McGregor sees opportunities
for [[Native]] environmental knowledge and [[Western]] [[science]] and tech
nology to act together in meeting the challenges posed by global en

vironmental change.67 McGregor makes this broader point by

stating, "What is required is a different way of thinking, a paradigm
shift from that of [[Aboriginal]] people as objects to be stu[[died]] to that of
[[Aboriginal]]s as real people."68
Such a shift in thinking will certainly challenge received forms of

historical thinking, especially the types of historical imagery de

ployed by Krech in his analysis of the ecological [[Indian]] and the often
hostile reactions of [[white]]s to [[Native]] [[American]]s exercising their sover
eignty, as was the case at the Campo and Pine Ridge Reservations, re
spectively.69 McGregor's analysis of water protection has showcased

how she envisions [[Native]] knowledge contributing to ecological sus
tainability. McGregor observes that most [[Indigenous]] cultures include
narratives about the importance of water to the creation and sustain
ing of life. Underscoring Anishinaabe knowledge about the impor
tance of water to human life, McGregor writes eloquently about the
Anishinaabe women who began walking around the Great Lakes in
the early [[2000]]s to raise awareness about the spiritual importance of

water. This walk was inspired by Anishinaabe elder Josephine

Mandamin and became known as the Mother Earth Water Walk. In

addition to this type of consciousness raising activity, McGregor

highlights how the Anishinabek Nation, an [[Indigenous]] organization

that brings [[Native]] women's voices together, created the Women's

Water Commission, a body that has had a significant impact on envi
ronmental policy around [[Ontario]]'s Great Lakes region. The women's

activism and political engagement that McGregor has brought to
scholarly attention underscores the importance of water in [[Native]]
[[American]] environmental politics. To reinforce this point, McGregor
quotes Edward Benton-Banai's ([[Ojibwe]]) observation that "the Earth is
said to be a woman. In this way it is understood that woman preceded

man on the Earth. She is called Mother Earth because from her come

all living things. Water is her lifeblood. It flows through her, nour
ishes her, and purifies her."70 Water, like fire, is both a life-giving and

cleansing force in Anishinaabe tradition, as it is in other [[Indigenous]]

cultures. Moreover, McGregor posits that the special connection that
[[Indigenous]] women have with water inheres in them a wisdom that
should receive serious consideration when [[government]]s consult with
local communities on issues of "water management."71

The active engagement of [[Indigenous]] women in environmental

conservation and sustainability has constituted the life work of an

other Anishinaabe woman, Winona LaDuke. Since speaking before

the [[United]] [[Nations]] at the age of eighteen, Winona LaDuke has been

one of the most prominent, in[[flu]]ential, and insightful [[Native]]

[[American]] activist writers on issues related to environmental sustain

ability, neo[[colonialism]] and tribal [[sovereignty]], and women's health
and well-being. Born in Los Angeles in [[1959]], LaDuke grew up in
[[California]] and Oregon before receiving her [[college]] education at
Harvard [[University]]. She is an enrolled member of the Mississipp
Band of the Anishinabeg. She has served as the director of Honor th
Earth and as the campaign director for the White Earth Land
Recovery Project. Outside of [[Native]] America, LaDuke is best known
for being Ralph Nader's running mate on the [[1996]] and [[2000]] Green
Party presidential ticket.72

LaDuke has made her voice heard on environmental and tribal sover

eignty issues in many different arenas. She speaks regularly on [[college]]
campuses, has challenged the inertia that often defines mainstream
[[American]] political responses to environmental challenges, and has writ
ten eloquently in both fiction and nonfiction formats.73 Her language
and writing is readily accessible to both academic and general audiences,
and her insights are often quite profound. One scholar, in comparing

her writing to that of Shepherd Krech, argues that if Krech is an

"iconoclast," then LaDuke is "more of a romantic."74
Like [[Native]] [[American]] activist writers who have come before her,
such as political scientist Vine Deloria (Standing Rock Sioux), LaDuke
is engaged in a decolonization project that aims to reclaim [[Native]]
lands and communities from what she sees as the neocolonial

[[American]] state.75 LaDuke has attempted to engage the struct
neo[[colonialism]] in the [[United]] [[States]] with language that is both
arly and a call for action. She has urged increased ecological aw

claiming, "Our bodies are a mirror of our mother, and of

Earth," and she has directly addressed the reality of global war
"Somewhere between the teachings of [[Western]] [[science]] and th
the [[Native]] community," LaDuke has written, "there is some ag
about the state of the world. Ecosystems are collapsing, species
ing extinct, the polar icecaps are melting, the ozone layer is wi
and [[nuclear]] radiation has contaminated the land."77

LaDuke sees a clear connection between [[Indigenous]] cultur
tions and the political and economic issues that have con
[[Native]] [[American]]s in the late twentieth and early twenty-

centuries. "It's difficult to separate 'cultural' from other proj

LaDuke contends, "because they are so integrated."78 LaDuke is thus

a proponent of pressing [[Native]] [[American]] political agendas at all
levels of society—from the political to the everyday. She has also

expressed a belief in the importance of asserting [[Indigenous]] perspec
tives into the "mainstream" political agenda.79 But if there is one fac
tor that has enabled LaDuke to distinguish her thinking on the

environment and issues of tribal [[sovereignty]] it is that [[Indigenous]]
women have an active role to play.80 To facilitate this engagement,
LaDuke has actively promoted the [[Indigenous]] Women's Network, a
[[grassroots]] collaborative that champions issues of major concern to

[[Native]] women.

LauuKe nas given tnese organizational activities tneir intellectual

thrust through her writings and speeches. For over two decades, she
has connected cultural, political, and environmental activism with
her interpretations of traditional [[Indigenous]] spirituality and the im
portance of seasonal changes to [[Native]] understandings of the world.
LaDuke maintains that such connections are not only important to

[[Native]] [[American]] environmental activism, but are critical for women

to make. "As a woman," LaDuke argues, "I think it makes sense for
me to worry about whether my great-grand[[child]]ren can live here and

whether [[indigenous]] communities can survive." She adds that envi

ronmental awareness and activism is as much a woman's issue as it is

an [[Indigenous]] concern: "I also think the mainstream women's move

ment should be more concerned about the environment. That's a

women's issue. Take breast cancer, for example. Women should b

rioting. Instead, the disease gets overly personalized and all of the

toxic dumping and environmental destruction that cause it get
nored."81 The cultural and intellectual starting point from whic

LaDuke has urged greater ecological awareness is rooted in her unde
standing of traditional [[Indigenous]] knowledge systems. She explains
that "Traditional ecological knowledge is the culturally and spiri

ally based way in which [[indigenous]] peoples relate to their ecosy

tems. This knowledge is founded on spiritual-cultural instructions
from 'time immemorial' and on generations of careful observation

within an ecosystem of continuous residence. I believe that thi

knowledge represents the clearest empirically based system for re
source management and ecosystem protection in North America."82
LaDuke's emphasis on the importance of traditional knowledge, em
pirical observations, and an awareness of "natural law" has remained
a consistent thread in the way she addresses the relationship between
human behavior and the environment. "The key to a sustainable soc

ety," she argues, "is accountability to natural law. [[Indigenous]], o

land-based societies (wherever they are found in the world or in hi
tory), understand that all life is accountable to natural law. Laws
made by nations, states, provinces, cities, etc., are inferior to this
supreme law."83

102 | Environmental History 20 ([[January]] [[2015]])

But how do [[Indigenous]] environmental activists define natural law?
LaDuke defines it in reference to the cyclical nature of the seasons—

of birth, [[death]], and rebirth—in [[Native]] [[American]] philosophies.
Natural law, LaDuke contends, is "An alternative interpretation of
the world. . . [that involves] 'continuous rebirth.' This is how we tra
ditionally understand the world and how [[indigenous]] societies have
come to live with natural law." Importantly, LaDuke's understanding
of [[Indigenous]] traditions is not that of static, unchanging cultures; in
stead, [[Native]] knowledge systems are dynamic, innovative, and adapt
able. As LaDuke explains, "Two tenets are essential to this paradigm
[of continuous rebirth]: cyclical thinking and reciprocal relations and
responsibilities to the Earth and creation."84

Adapting traditional [[Indigenous]] philosophies about the environ

ment to the modern world also magnify the significance of reciproc

ity in debates about ecological sustainability. In [[Western]] cultures,
reciprocity is overshadowed by the principles of competition, the ac

cumulation of wealth, and economic possessiveness. In contrast,

[[Indigenous]] concepts of reciprocity in North America view nonhuman
and human ecosystems as interconnected. Whether human or
nonhuman, this worldview considers all life-forms as animate. And

governing all of this, LaDuke explains, is an ethos: "You take only
what you need, and you leave the rest."85

LaDuke has made these arguments in a systematic and sustained

way in numerous books. In Recovering the Sacred ([[2005]]), she presents a
series of case studies that demonstrate how the [[history]] of [[colonialism]]
continues to have an impact on [[Native]] [[American]]s. She observes that
examples of academic bullying, corporate greed, the "jackhammer of
industrial society," and the "binge of neocolonial expansion" that
has gone on in recent coal mining and oil drilling operations all high
light how the concerns of [[American]] [[Indian]]s are so often dismissed or
simply treated with contempt.86 In lobbying to retain access to land
and water resources on tribal lands, LaDuke points out that universi

ties, corporations, and [[government]]s all too often dismiss [[Native]]
[[American]] viewpoints on the grounds that they are not authentic
[[Indian]] perspectives, or because the profit-driven activities of corpo
rate America prioritize economic growth as the critical component of
national security ahead of environmental sustainability and respect
for the [[sovereignty]] of [[Indigenous]] nations.

CONCLUSION

Winona LaDuke's activism and writing continues to focus on en
ronmental justice for tribal nations in the [[United]] [[States]]. Like th

White Plumes, she opposes the erosion of tribal [[sovereignty]] so that
oil pipelines can cut through [[Indian]] Country or so trucks can trans
port dirty tar sands oil through [[Indian]] reservations without permits
from Tribal Councils.87 And like Deborah McGregor, LaDuke encour
ages [[Native]] peoples to connect with their traditions and to apply les

sons millennia in the making to [[foster]] sustainable agricultural

practices and the management of ecosystems in the twenty-first cen

tury. Such an approach involves local action that promises to have
transnational consequences.88
The recent [[history]] of the Campo in [[California]], the Oglala-Sioux at

Pine Ridge, and the insightfulness of [[Indigenous]] women like

Deborah McGregor and Winona LaDuke provide a broad framework
for moving beyond the stereotypes associated with the ecological
[[Indian]]s and beginning to recognize that concepts such as ecology,
environment, and sustainability are historically specific, culturally
constructed, and yet intimately intertwined. Concepts like ecology,
environment, and sustainability have lived meanings, and it is
through specific human consciousness and cognition that these con
cepts receive validation and meaning. How an individual, or group of
individuals, see the ecology of a particular place and how they narrate
its value both shapes and is shaped by the dynamic nature of belief
systems. This dynamism is particularly pronounced in [[Indigenous]] so
cieties with traditions of oral storytelling, a narrative form that is the
basis for human behaviors and a traditionally grounded, yet simulta
neously modern, socially relevant, and meaningful, understanding of
the nature-human balance.

I make these points not to reiterate the ahistorical mythologies as
sociated with the "noble savage" and ecological [[Indian]]; instead I offer
them as a reminder that the ecological knowledge accumulated in
[[Native]] [[American]] communities is over two millennia in the making.
This knowledge may well offer all [[American]]s solutions to the envi
ronmental destructiveness wrought across North America by over
four centuries of [[colonialism]] and offer insights into how to address
the realities of global environmental changes in the twenty-first cen
tury. We would all be well served to shelve the stereotypes associated

with the ecological [[Indian]] and instead heed the lessons of [[First]]
[[Nations]] environmental groups such as the Women's Water
Commission of the Anishinabek Nation, incorporate the ideas of
[[Native]] Women like Debra White Plume, Deborah McGregor, and
Winona LaDuke into local, national, and international discussions
about rapid global [[climate]] change, and to engage in a meaningful di

alogue with [[Indigenous]] communities and families living with un
precedented extremes in weather and dramatic modifications in
ecosystems throughout North America.
