[[June]] 20, 2021Updated 2:13 p.m. ET

YEKATERINBURG, [[Russia]] — Patients with unexplained pneumonias started showing up at hospitals; within days, dozens were dead. The secret police seized doctors’ records and ordered them to keep silent. [[American]] spies picked up clues about a lab leak, but the local authorities had a more mundane explanation: contaminated meat.

It took more than a decade for the truth to come out.

In [[April]] and [[May]] [[1979]], at least 66 people [[died]] after airborne anthrax bacteria emerged from a military lab in the [[Soviet]] Union. But leading [[American]] scientists voiced confidence in the [[Soviet]]s’ claim that the pathogen had jumped from animals to humans. Only after a [full-fledged investigation in the [[1990]]s](https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/15/world/us-and-russian-doctors-tie-anthrax-to-soviets.html) did one of those scientists confirm the earlier suspicions: The accident in what is now the [[Russia]]n Urals city of Yekaterinburg was a lab leak, one of the deadliest ever documented.

Nowadays, some of the victims’ graves appear abandoned, their names worn off their metal plates in the back of a cemetery on the outskirts of town, where they were buried in coffins with an agricultural disinfectant. But the story of the accident that took their lives, and the cover-up that hid it, has renewed relevance as scientists search for the origins of [[Covid]]-19.

It shows how an authoritarian [[government]] can successfully shape the narrative of a disease outbreak and how it can take years — and, perhaps, regime change — to get to the truth.

“Wild rumors do spread around every [[epidemic]],” [Joshua Lederberg](https://www.nytimes.com/[[2008]]/02/05/us/05lederberg.html), the Nobel-winning [[American]] biologist, [wrote in a memo](https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/bb/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-10[[1584]]906X[[1871]]7-doc) after a fact-finding trip to Moscow in [[1986]]. “The current [[Soviet]] account is very likely to be true.”

Many scientists believe that the [[virus]] that caused the [[Covid]]-19 [[pandemic]] evolved in animals and jumped at some point to humans. But scientists are also calling for deeper investigation of [the possibility of an accident](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/health/wuhan-[[corona[[virus]]]]-lab-leak.html) at the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology.

There is also widespread concern that the [[Chinese]] [[government]] — which, like the [[Soviet]] [[government]] decades before it, dismisses the possibility of a lab leak — is [not providing international investigators](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/30/[[science]]/china-covid-origin-wuhan.html) with access and data that could shed light on the [[pandemic]]’s origins.

“We all have a common interest in finding out if it was due to a laboratory accident,” Matthew Meselson, a Harvard biologist, said in an interview this month from Cambridge, Mass., referring to the [[corona[[virus]]]] [[pandemic]]. “[[May]]be it was a kind of accident that our present guidelines don’t protect against adequately.”

Dr. Meselson, a [[biological]] warfare expert, moved into a spare bedroom in the home of a friend at the C.I.A. in [[1980]] to study classified intelligence suggesting that the [[Soviet]] anthrax outbreak [could have been linked to a military facility](https://www.nytimes.com/[[1988]]/04/14/world/russians-explain-79-anthrax-cases.html) nearby. Six years later, [he wrote](https://collections.nlm.nih.gov/ext/document/10[[1584]]906X[[1887]]5/PDF/10[[1584]]906X[[1887]]5.pdf) that the [[Soviet]] explanation of the [[epidemic]]’s natural origins was “plausible.” The evidence the [[Soviet]]s provided was consistent, he said, with the theory that people had been stricken by intestinal anthrax that originated in contaminated bone meal used as animal feed.

Then, in [[1992]], after the [[Soviet]] Union collapsed, [[President]] Boris N. Yeltsin of [[Russia]] acknowledged “our military development was the cause” of the anthrax outbreak.

Dr. Meselson and his wife, [the medical anthropologist Jeanne Guillemin](https://www.nytimes.com/[[2019]]/12/22/[[science]]/jeanne-guillemin-dead.html), came to Yekaterinburg with other [[American]] experts for a painstaking study. They documented how a northeasterly wind on [[April]] 2, [[1979]], must have scattered as little as a few milligrams of anthrax spores accidentally released from the factory across a narrow zone extending at least 30 miles downwind.

“You can concoct a completely crazy story and make it plausible by the way you design it,” Dr. Meselson said, explaining why the [[Soviet]]s had succeeded in dispelling suspicions about a lab leak.

In Sverdlovsk, as Yekaterinburg was known in [[Soviet]] times, those suspicions appeared as soon as people started falling mysteriously ill, according to interviews this month with residents who remember those days.

Raisa Smirnova, then a 32-year-old worker at a ceramics factory nearby, says she had friends at the mysterious compound who used their special privileges to help her procure otherwise hard-to-find oranges and canned meat. She also heard that there was some sort of secret work on [[germs]] being done there, and local rumors would attribute occasional disease outbreaks to the lab.

“Why is it that your hands are blue?” Ms. Smirnova recalls a co-worker asking her one day in [[April]] [[1979]] when she went to work, apparently showing [symptoms of low blood oxygen levels.](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/anthrax/)

She was rushed to the hospital with a high fever and, she says, spent a week there unconscious. By [[May]], some 18 of her co-workers had [[died]]. Before she was allowed to go home, K.G.B. agents took her a document to sign, prohibiting her from talking about the events for 25 years.

At Sverdlovsk’s epidemiological service, the epidemiologist Viktor [[Roma]]nenko was a foot soldier in the cover-up. He says he knew immediately that the disease outbreak striking the city could not be intestinal, food-borne anthrax as the senior health authorities claimed. The pattern and timing of the cases’ distribution showed that the source was airborne and a one-time event.

“We all understood that this was utter nonsense,” said Dr. [[Roma]]nenko, who went on to become a senior regional health official in post-[[Soviet]] times.

But in a Communist state, he had no choice but to go along with the charade, and he and his colleagues spent months seizing and [[testing]] meat. K.G.B. agents descended on his office and took away medical records. The [[Soviet]] Union had signed a [[treaty]] banning [[biological]] weapons, and national interests were at stake.

“There was an understanding that we had to get as far away as possible from the [[biological]]-weapons theory,” Dr. [[Roma]]nenko recalled. “The task was to defend the honor of the country.”

There were even jitters at the Evening Sverdlovsk, a local newspaper. A correspondent from The New York Times called the newsroom as the outbreak unfolded, recalls a journalist there at the time, Aleksandr Pashkov. The editor in chief told the staff to stop answering long-distance calls, lest anyone go off-message if the correspondent called again.

“He who can keep a secret comes out on top,” Mr. Pashkov said.

As the [[Soviet]] Union crumbled, so did its ability to keep secrets. For a [[1992]] documentary, Mr. Pashkov tracked down a retired counterintelligence officer in [[Ukraine]] — now a different country — who had worked in Sverdlovsk at the time. Telephone intercepts at the military lab, the officer said, revealed that a technician had forgotten to replace a safety filter.

Soon, Mr. Yeltsin — who himself was part of the cover-up as the top Communist official in the region in [[1979]] — admitted that the military was to blame.

“You need to understand one simple thing,” Mr. Pashkov said. “Why did all this become known? The collapse of the Union.”

The husband-and-wife team of Dr. Meselson and Dr. Guillemin visited Yekaterinburg several times in the [[1990]]s to document the leak. Interviewing survivors, they plotted the victims’ whereabouts and investigated weather records, finding that Dr. Meselson and others had been wrong to give credence to the [[Soviet]] narrative.

Dr. Meselson said that when he contacted a [[Russia]]n official in the early [[1990]]s about reinvestigating the outbreak, the response was, “Why take skeletons out of the closet?”

But he said that determining the origins of [[epidemic]]s becomes more critical when geopolitics are involved. Had he and his colleagues not proved the cause of the outbreak back then, he said, the matter might still be an irritant in the relationship between [[Russia]] and the West.

The same goes for the investigation into the source of [[Covid]]-19, Dr. Meselson said. As long as the [[pandemic]]’s source remains a matter of suspicion, he said, the question will continue to raise tensions with [[China]], more so than if the truth were known.

“There’s a huge difference between people who are still trying to prove a point against emotional opposition and people who can look back and say, ‘Yeah, yeah, I was right,’” Dr. Meselson said. “One of them fuels wars. The other is [[history]]. We need to get all these things solved. We need [[history]], we don’t need all this emotion.”

Unlike [[Covid]]-19, anthrax does not easily pass from human to human, which is why the Sverdlovsk lab leak did not cause a broader [[epidemic]]. Even the Sverdlovsk case, however, has not been fully solved. It remains unclear whether the secret activity at the factory was illegal [[biological]] weapons development — which the [[Soviet]] Union is known to have performed — or [[vaccine]] research.

Under [[President]] Vladimir V. Putin, revealing [[Russia]]n historical shortcomings has increasingly been deemed unpatriotic. With the [[government]] mum on what exactly happened, a different theory has gained currency: Perhaps it was [[Western]] agents who deliberately released anthrax spores to undermine the Communist regime.

“The concept of truth, in fact, is very complicated,” said Lev Grinberg, a Yekaterinburg pathologist who secretly preserved evidence of the true nature of the outbreak in [[1979]]. “Those who don’t want to accept the truth will always find ways not to accept it.”
