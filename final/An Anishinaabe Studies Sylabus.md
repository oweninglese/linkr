Title: An Anishinaabe Studies Syllabus

Inspired by many other public syllabuses such as the #FergusonSyllabus, 
#CharlestonSyllabus, #StandingRockSyllabus, and others, I decided to create a 
“syllabus” (more like a generic reading list) of Anishinaabe Studies. This was, 
in part, an [[experiment]] I have wanted to do for a while, in response to a number 
of academics (including some Anishinaabe scholars!) who told me there wasn’t 
enough material to claim the existence of Anishinaabe Studies as a field. There 
are, as of [[August]] 15th [[2018]], over 80 different books (plus a few articles) on 
this list, most of them by Anishinaabe writers. This doesn’t even begin to touch
the vast amounts of Anishinaabe writing that is not in the form of book-length 
scholarship.
 
This list is very much a work in progress and I welcome additions and 
suggestions! Many sections are particularly incomplete, like the [[history]] 
sections and the gender/sexuality sections. And since I’m only one person, I’m 
sure my biases show (there is a lot of Wisconsin/Minnesota [[Ojibwe]] material, 
which is just because that’s where I grew up and what I know). Please note that 
I have not read everything on this list and can’t vouch for all of it being 
perfect. I offer it anyway with the idea that most of it, hopefully, is worth 
engaging with. In addition, I hope to make a version of this at some point 
specifically focusing on non-scholarly material and things that can be accessed 
for free–but I am also a student about to start the school year, so that may be 
a ways off.
 
Note: I have chosen to use Anishinaabe as a catch-all umbrella for those [[Native]] 
people who speak a variety of the language known as Anishinaabemowin, or who are
citizens of a nation that was part of the Three Fires of [[Ojibwe]], Odawa, and 
Potawatomi people. Please correct me if I have mislabeled anyone’s identity. I 
have tried to include authors’ tribal affiliation where applicable; Anishinaabe 
authors are identified by their band or tribe alone in most cases.
 
Mino-agindaasog!
