There is no doubt that pre- and post-confederation [[government]]s in what is now 
known as [[Canada]] have developed policies, enacted laws and regulations, and 
engaged in practices that have had as their primary objectives: (1) to acquire 
[[First]] Nation lands and resources and (2) to reduce financial obligations 
acquired through [[treaties]] and other agreements with [[First]] [[Nations]]. Their primary
methods have been to eliminate and/or assimilate “[[Indian]]s”. Elimination took the
forms of small pox blankets, scalping bounties, murders, starvation rations, and
forced sterilizations. Attempts at forced assimilation took place in the form 
residential schools, forced adoptions (60’s scoop), and the [[Indian]] Act which 
outlawed certain cultural practices and created a legislative extinction date 
for [[First]] [[Nations]]. The impact of these laws, policies and practices have been 
nothing short of genocidal. The specific impact to [[First]] [[Nations]] languages have 
been devastating. The majority of the 70 different [[First]] Nation languages are at
risk of extinction.
 
The federal [[government]] would have us all believe that have moved on from this 
so-called legacy of the past and have transitioned into a period of 
reconciliation. The former Conservative [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Stephen Harper apologized
in Parliament for the harms of residential schools:
 
 
Two primary objectives of the Residential Schools system were to remove and 
isolate [[child]]ren from the in[[flu]]ence of their homes, families, traditions and 
cultures, and to assimilate them into the dominant culture. These objectives 
were based on the assumption [[Aboriginal]] cultures and spiritual beliefs were 
inferior and unequal. Indeed, some sought, as it was infamously said, "to [[kill]] 
the [[Indian]] in the [[child]]". Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation 
was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country. (PM Stephen 
Harper)
 
 
Yet, following this apology, the Conservative [[government]] made staggering funding
cuts to [[First]] [[Nations]] and [[First]] Nation organizations; and reduced the funds 
available for [[First]] Nation languages. Harper’s empty apology meant that the 
majority of [[First]] Nation languages would continue to be at risk of extinction. 
 
 
However, Harper’s decade of doom was followed by the welcome election promises 
of the current Liberal [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Justin [[[[Trudeau]]]] who promised to undo all 
the harms of the previous Harper [[government]], including the repeal of legislation
imposed on [[First]] [[Nations]] during Harper’s era. [[[[Trudeau]]]] also promised to implement
all the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (TRC) Calls to Action and in 
particular, committed to legislate the formal recognition of [[Indigenous]] 
languages as an [[Aboriginal]] right and provide sufficient funding. Where he went 
wrong was in partnering with an [[Aboriginal]] organization - the Assembly of [[First]] 
[[Nations]] - to do this work, instead of working with the rights-holders: [[First]] 
[[Nations]] and their language experts. What has resulted is Bill C-91 An Act 
Respecting [[Indigenous]] Languages – legislation bountiful in flowery wording and 
empty on substantive rights. Not the best way to start off [[2019]] – the year of 
[[Indigenous]] Languages.
 
 
Bill C-91 was introduced and had its first reading by the [[Minister]] of [[Canadian]] 
Heritage and Multiculturalism Pablo Rodriguez, on [[February]] 5, [[2019]]. The bill 
went to second reading on [[February]] 20, [[2019]] and was referred to the Standing 
Committee on [[Canadian]] Heritage on the same day. Therein lies the first problem –
that this bill is sponsored by the [[Minister]] of [[Canadian]] Heritage and 
Multiculturalism and being stu[[died]] by the Standing Committee on [[Canadian]] 
Heritage. [[First]] Nation rights are not a matter of [[Canadian]] heritage or 
multi-culturalism. [[First]] [[Nations]] are not comparable to minorities or ethnic 
groups. [[First]] [[Nations]] are the original sovereign [[Nations]] of the territories on 
which [[Canada]] now sits with their nation-based laws, customs, practices, 
[[government]]s, economies, trading networks, and military [[alliance]]s. Their status 
as sovereign [[Nations]] was undisputed and is the reason why [[treaties]] were signed. 
[[Nations]] only sign [[treaties]] with other [[Nations]] – not with subjects, citizens or 
cultural groups. [[First]] [[Nations]] were not then, nor are they now mere cultural 
groups. 
 
 
[[[[Trudeau]]]] had promised to work together with [[First]] [[Nations]] on a Nation-to-Nation 
basis in a way that recognizes [[First]] Nation rights and work in partnership, 
instead of the usual paternalistic, top-down approach. Yet, Bill C-91 is exactly
that – top-down legislation drafted with the advice of the AFN, but not the 
[[First]] Nation rights-holders themselves. Worse than that, the bill is not a 
recognition of the official status of [[First]] Nation language rights or a 
guaranteed minimum level of funding. It reads more like a carefully worded, 
overly broad, vague set of theoretical aspirations than any legal commitment one
could enforce. Even the [[Indigenous]] Languages Commissioner as set out in the bill
is appointed by, paid by, and can be removed by, [[Canada]]; with powers limited to 
[[research]] and advocacy. This is a real missed opportunity for [[[[Trudeau]]]] who could 
have worked with [[First]] [[Nations]] language experts and designed legislation to 
truly protect [[First]] Nation languages and take real steps to undo the devastation
done by federal laws and policies. 
 
 
Although there are many problems with the wording in every section of this bill,
and there are many legal problems raised with said wording, I have five core 
concerns. [[First]], there is no specific recognition of [[First]] Nation languages as 
official languages, nor is there a specific [[First]] Nation language right that is 
actually granted or recognized. The bill merely references rights “in relation 
to” [[Indigenous]] languages, but this could mean one’s personal right to speak a 
language versus the right to receive [[government]] services on one’s language, for 
example. Secondly, there is no specific recognition of [[First]] Nation jurisdiction
or powers in relation to [[First]] Nation languages. The [[Minister]] of [[Canadian]] 
Heritage and Multiculturalism retains all powers in relation to the bill and any
future regulations. 
 
 
My third concern is that there is no specific or firm commitment in relation to 
funding. The bill provides that the [[Minister]] will “establish measures to 
facilitate the provision” of funding. However, establishing “measures” is not a 
direct commitment for a specific funding amount or a commitment to whom this 
funding will flow. This relates to my fourth concern, that the bill promotes a 
pan-[[Aboriginal]] approach that is not [[First]] Nation-specific and appears to put 
other broadly-defined “[[Indigenous]] groups” on the same level as [[First]] [[Nations]]. 
Under this bill, funds could flow to anyone who incorporated an organization and
claimed to be [[Indigenous]] – despite their lack of status as actual rights-holders
within a specific [[First]] Nation territory. 
 
 
Finally, this bill appears to utilize the same federally-controlled legislative 
framework concept for rights definition, limitation and scoping. [[[[Trudeau]]]] already
had to back away from the federal rights recognition framework already rejected 
by numerous [[First]] [[Nations]] and [[First]] Nation organizations. Of particular concern 
is the federal [[government]]’s intention to establish a “framework” that is 
intended to define, limit and determine the scope of the language rights to be 
exercised, how and by whom, by way of negotiated agreements. While the AFN and 
the Metis National Council have come out in support of the bill, the Inuit 
Tapariit Kanatami have been very critical of it, explaining that they feel 
[[Canada]] acted in bad faith, that is not Inuit-specific, and does not protect 
Inuit language rights.
 
 
"The absence of any Inuit-specific content suggests this bill is yet another 
legislative initiative developed behind closed doors by a colonial system and 
then imposed on Inuit." ([[President]] Natan Obed)
 
 
It is important to remember that legislation is not legally required for the 
federal [[government]] to provide services in [[Indigenous]] languages or to provide 
funding to [[First]] [[Nations]] for [[Indigenous]] languages. One should always be weary of
a [[government]] bearing gifts in the form of legislation, as it usually comes with 
federal control, provisions which limit [[First]] Nation rights, and can ultimately 
be amended or repealed at the will of [[government]].
 
 
The TRC Calls to Action, the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples, and the 
United [[Nations]] Declaration on the Rights of [[Indigenous]] Peoples all provide 
support for legal recognition and financial support for [[First]] Nation languages. 
That being said, for those [[First]] [[Nations]] who support federal legislation to 
enhance the political and legal commitment to [[First]] Nation languages, the key 
moving forward will be in the wording. To make this legislation more helpful 
than harmful, substantive amendments will be required. Given the speed at which 
Parliament is moving the study of this legislation, it is unlikely that the 
majority of [[First]] [[Nations]], their [[representative]] organizations, and language 
experts will get their 10-minute opportunity to present to the Standing 
Committee on much-needed amendments. 
 
 
Perhaps once the bill reaches the Senate, they will embrace their role as the 
“sober second thought” of [[government]] and slow down the process enough to hear 
from [[First]] Nation experts and consider meaningful amendments - assuming there 
still is a Liberal [[government]] after the SNC-Lavalin scandal.
