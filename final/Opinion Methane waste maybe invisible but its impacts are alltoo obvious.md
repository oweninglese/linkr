Methane waste may be invisible, but its impacts are all-too obvious
By Lisa DeVille
 
When the [[Trump]] administration suspended[1] long-overdue updates of regulations 
on preventing methane waste and limiting wasteful flaring of natural gas last 
month, it was a slap in the face for all of us who live on the Fort Berthold 
[[Indian]] Reservation in Manderee, N.D.
 
The Bureau of Land Management’s Waste Prevention Rule would have required 
[[companies]] drilling on public and tribal lands to reduce the leaking, venting or 
flaring of natural gas through maintenance of equipment and use of proven 
technologies. This is a rule that my community fought for because we experience 
the impacts of methane pollution daily.
 
The Fort Berthold [[Indian]] Reservation is surrounded by nearly 1,000 oil and gas 
wells that make the unceasing extraction of the resources beneath our land hard 
to escape. The air smells like rotten eggs, the noise disrupts our lives and the
gas flares make our night skies look like bright summer days.
 
But even with all the evidence of pollution, I did not fully understand the 
severity of the problem until I stood next to a gas well with an infrared camera
in [[2016]].
 
Giant plumes of methane leak into the atmosphere unseen. As an environmental 
student, [[climate]] activist and a Manderee resident, witnessing the extent of the 
methane leakage across my community left me speechless.
 
This is why I joined a lawsuit[2] to stop the [[Trump]] administration from 
willfully polluting our community and wasting our resources. The lawsuit 
challenges the authority of the administration to suspend the rule without 
adequate public process and in defiance of its legal obligation to take all 
reasonable precautions to prevent waste of publicly owned oil and gas.

Studies have shown that flaring, venting and leaking of methane and natural gas 
cause increased risks of asthma, respiratory infections, cancer and neurological
damage. We have experienced several of these impacts[5] firsthand as oil and gas
activity has increased exponentially over the last decade on the Fort Berthold 
[[Indian]] Reservation. Though we are told that we live a safe distance from the 
drilling, our family’s medical tests mirror those of the drillers themselves.
 
They get paid to take that health risk. We don’t.
 
I also worry about the impact of methane pollution on the planet. Methane, a 
greenhouse gas that is 86 times more potent than carbon dioxide[6], is the 
second-largest contributor to human-caused [[climate]] change.
 
The suspension of the rule hurts our pocketbooks, too. Between [[2009]] and [[2014]], 
oil and gas on public and tribal lands vented, flared and [[leaked]] about 375 
billion feet of natural gas – enough to supply over 5 million homes a year. 
According to BLM’s own calculations, suspending the Waste Prevention Rule will 
increase methane emissions by 175,000 tons over the next year and result in the 
waste of 9 billion cubic feet of natural gas.
 
Each year, the industry loses hundreds of millions of dollars worth of natural 
gas due to venting on federal and tribal lands alone. And the fact that 
[[companies]] don’t have to pay royalties on the gas they waste means that without 
the Waste Prevention Rule in place, taxpayers will lose out on millions[7] of 
dollars in revenue every year.
 
This could be invested in schools, health care, drug [[treatment]] programs and so 
much more.
 
The Government Accountability Office found in [[2010]] that 40 percent of the 
natural gas vented and flared on federal lands could be captured cheaply with 
technology that was already available. The oil and gas industry is simply 
resistant for the sake of it. It’s only logical that a nearly 40-year-old rule 
should be updated to reflect technological advances.
 
We need stringent controls on methane pollution. We need monitoring, [[testing]] and
studies that explain the environmental and human health impacts of exposure. The
[[2016]] Waste Prevention Rule promised all that. The Interior Department’s move to 
suspend the rule is nothing but appeasement of the oil and gas industry.
 
Just because we can’t see the methane pouring out of wells without an infrared 
camera doesn’t means it isn’t.
