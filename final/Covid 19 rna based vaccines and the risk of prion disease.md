## ABSTRACT

```
Development of new [[vaccine]] technology has been plagued with problems in the past. The current [[RNA]] based SARS-
CoV-2 [[vaccine]]s were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety [[testing]]. In
this paper the [[Pfizer]] [[COVID]]-19 [[vaccine]] was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in [[vaccine]]
recipients. The [[RNA]] sequence of the [[vaccine]] as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the
potential to convert intracellular [[RNA]] binding proteins TAR [[DNA]] binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma
(FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations. The results indicate that the [[vaccine]] [[RNA]] has specific sequences
that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations. In the current analysis a total
of sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two
GGΨA sequences were found. Potential G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but a more sophisticated
computer program is needed to verify these. Furthermore, the spike protein, created by the translation of the [[vaccine]]
[[RNA]], binds angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a zinc containing enzyme. This interaction has the potential
to increase intracellular zinc. Zinc ions have been shown to cause the transformation of TDP-43 to its pathologic
prion configuration. The folding of TDP-43 and FUS into their pathologic prion confirmations is known to cause
ALS, front temporal lobar degeneration, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological degenerative diseases. The
enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the
[[RNA]] based [[vaccine]]s for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the [[vaccine]] may cause much more harm than benefit.

## Introduction

```
Vaccines have been found to cause a host of chronic, late developing
adverse events. Some adverse events like type 1 diabetes may not
occur until 3-4 years after a [[vaccine]] is administered [1]. In the
example of type 1 diabetes the frequency of cases of adverse events
may surpass the frequency of cases of severe infectious disease
the [[vaccine]] was designed to prevent. Given that type 1 diabetes is
only one of many [[immune]] mediated diseases potentially caused by
[[vaccine]]s, chronic late occurring adverse events are a serious public
health issue.
```

```
The advent of new [[vaccine]] technology creates new potential
mechanisms of [[vaccine]] adverse events. For example, the first
[[kill]]ed polio [[vaccine]] actually caused polio in recipients because
the up scaled manufacturing process did not effectively [[kill]]
```

```
the polio [[virus]] before it was injected into patients. [[RNA]] based
[[vaccine]]s offers special risks of inducing specific adverse events.
One such potential adverse event is prion based diseases caused
by activation of intrinsic proteins to form [[prions]]. A wealth of
knowledge has been published on a class of [[RNA]] binding proteins
shown to participating in causing a number of neurological
diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and ALS. TDP-43 and
FUS are among the best stu[[died]] of these proteins [2].
```

```
The [[Pfizer]] [[RNA]] based [[COVID]]-19 [[vaccine]] was approved by the
US FDA under an emergency use authorization without long term
safety data. Because of concerns about the safety of this [[vaccine]] a
study was performed to determine if the [[vaccine]] could potentially
induce prion based disease.
```

## Methods

```
[[Pfizer]]’s [[RNA]] based [[vaccine]] against [[COVID]]-19 was evaluated for
the potential to convert TDP-43 and or FUS to their prion based
```

disease causing states. The [[vaccine]] [[RNA]] was analyzed for the  
presence of sequences that can activate TDP-43 and FUS. The  
interaction of the transcribed spike protein with its target was  
analyzed to determine if this action could also activate TDP-  
and FUS.

## Results

Analysis of the [[Pfizer]] [[vaccine]] against [[COVID]]-19 identified two  
potential risk factors for inducing prion disease is humans. The [[RNA]]  
sequence in the [[vaccine]] \[3\] contains sequences believed to induce  
TDP-43 and FUS to aggregate in their prion based conformation  
leading to the development of common neurodegerative diseases.  
In particular it has been shown that [[RNA]] sequences GGUA \[4\],  
UG rich sequences \[5\], UG tandem repeats \[6\], and G Quadruplex  
sequences \[7\], have increased affinity to bind TDP-43 and or  
FUS and may cause TDP-43 or FUS to take their pathologic  
configurations in the cytoplasm. In the current analysis a total of  
sixteen UG tandem repeats (ΨGΨG) were identified and additional  
UG (ΨG) rich sequences were identified. Two GGΨA sequences  
were found. G Quadruplex sequences are possibly present but  
sophisticated computer programs are needed to verify these.

The spike protein encoded by the [[vaccine]] binds angiotensin  
converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme which contains zinc  
molecules \[8\]. The binding of spike protein to ACE2 has the  
potential to release the zinc molecule, an ion that causes TDP-  
to assume its pathologic prion transformation \[9\].

## Discussion

There is an old saying in medicine that “the cure may be worse  
than the disease.” The phrase can be applied to [[vaccine]]s. In the  
current paper the concern is raised that the [[RNA]] based [[COVID]]  
[[vaccine]]s have the potential to cause more disease than the  
[[epidemic]] of [[COVID]]-19. This paper focuses on a novel potential  
adverse event mechanism causing prion disease which could be  
even more common and debilitating than the viral infection the  
[[vaccine]] is designed to prevent. While this paper focuses on one  
potential adverse event there are multiple other potential fatal  
adverse events as discussed below.

Over the last two decades there has been a concern among certain  
scientists that [[prions]] could be used as [[bioweapon]]s. More recently  
there has been a concern that ubiquitous intracellular molecules  
could be activated to cause prion disease including Alzheimer’s  
disease, ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. This concern  
originates due to potential for misuse of research data on the  
mechanisms by which certain [[RNA]] binding proteins like TDP-43,  
FUS and others can be activated to form disease causing [[prions]].  
The fact that this research, which could be used for [[bioweapon]]s  
development, is funded by private organizations including the Bill  
and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Ellison Medical Foundation  
\[2\] without national/international oversight is also a concern.  
In the past, for example, there were prohibitions for publishing  
information pertaining to construction of [[nuclear]] [[bomb]]s.

```
Published data has shown that there are several different factors that
can contribute to the conversion of certain [[RNA]] binding proteins
including TDP-43, FUS and related molecules to their pathologic
states. These [[RNA]] binding proteins have many functions and are
found in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These binding proteins
have amino acid regions, binding motifs that bind specific [[RNA]]
sequences. Binding to certain [[RNA]] sequences when the proteins
are in the cytoplasm is believed to causes the molecules to fold in
certain ways leading to pathologic aggregation and prion formation
in the cytoplasm [2]. The current analysis indicates [[Pfizer]]'s [[RNA]]
based [[COVID]]-19 [[vaccine]] contains many of these [[RNA]] sequences
that have been shown to have high affinity for TDP-43 or FUS
and have the potential to induce chronic degenerative neurological
diseases.
```

```
Zinc binding to the [[RNA]] recognition motif of TDP-43 is another
mechanism leading to formation of amyloid like aggregations [9].
The viral spike protein, coded by the [[vaccine]] [[RNA]] sequence, binds
ACE2 an enzyme containing zinc molecules [8]. This interaction
has the potential to increase intracellular zinc levels leading to
prion disease. The initial binding could be between spike proteins
on the surface of the cell transfected by the [[vaccine]] and ACE
on the surface of an adjacent cell. The resulting complex may
become internalized. Alternatively, the interaction could initially
take place in the cytoplasm of a cell that makes ACE2 and has been
transfected with the [[vaccine]] [[RNA]] coding for the spike protein.
The interaction is quite concerning given the belief that the [[virus]]
causing [[COVID]]-19, SARS-CoV-2, is a [[bioweapon]] [10,11] and it
is possible that the viral spike protein may have been designed to
cause prion disease.
```

```
Another related concern is that the [[Pfizer]] [[vaccine]] uses a unique
[[RNA]] nucleoside 1-methyl-3'-pseudouridylyl (Ψ). According to
FDA briefing documents, this nucleoside was chosen to reduce
activation of the innate [[immune]] system [12]. [[RNA]] molecules
containing this nucleoside will undoubtedly have altered binding
[13]. Unfortunately, the effect on TDP-43, FUS and other [[RNA]]
binding proteins is not published. The use of this nucleoside in
a [[vaccine]] can potentially enhance the binding affinity of [[RNA]]
sequences capable of causing TDP-43 and FUS to assume toxic
configurations.
```

```
There are many other potential adverse events that can be induced
by the novel [[RNA]] based [[vaccine]]s against [[COVID]]-19. The [[vaccine]]
places a novel molecule, spike protein, in/on the surface of host
cells. This spike protein is a potential receptor for another possibly
novel infectious agent. If those who argue that the [[COVID]]-19 is
actually a [[bioweapon]] are correct, then a second potentially more
dangerous [[virus]] may be released that binds spike protein found on
the host cells of [[vaccine]] recipients. Data is not publicly available
to provide information on how long the [[vaccine]] [[RNA]] is translated
in the [[vaccine]] recipient and how long after translation the spike
protein will be present in the recipient’s cells. Such studies
pertaining to in vivo expression will be complex and challenging.
Genetic diversity protects species from mass casualties caused by
infectious agents. One individual may be [[kill]]ed by a [[virus]] while
```

another may have no ill effects from the same [[virus]]. By placing  
the identical receptor, the spike protein, on cells of everyone in a  
population, the genetic diversity for at least one potential receptor  
disappears. Everyone in the population now becomes potentially  
susceptible to binding with the same infectious agent.

Auto[[immunity]] and the opposing condition, metabolic syndrome,  
are well know adverse events caused by [[vaccine]]s \[14\]. [[COVID]]-  
infections are associated with the induction of auto[[antibodies]]  
and auto[[immune]] disease \[15,16\] making it more than plausible  
a [[vaccine]] could do the same. One author has found amino acid  
sequences coded by the spike protein to be identical to sequences  
in human proteins including proteins found in the CNS \[17\].  
Auto[[immunity]] can also be induced by epitope spreading when a  
foreign antigen, like the spike protein, is presented by an antigen  
presenting cell that also has self molecules attached to its MHC  
molecules.

Finally, others working in the field have published additional support  
that [[COVID]]-19 [[vaccine]]s could potentially induce prion disease.  
Authors \[18\] found prion related sequences in the [[COVID]]-19 spike  
protein which were not found in related [[corona[[virus]]]]es. Others \[19\]  
have reported a case of prion disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,  
initially occurring in a man with [[COVID]]-19.

Many have raised the warning that the current [[epidemic]] of  
[[COVID]]-19 is actually the result of an [[bioweapon]]s attack released  
in part by individuals in the [[United]] [[States]] [[government]] \[10,11\].  
Such a theory is not far fetched given that the 2001 anthrax attack  
in the US originated at Fort Detrick, a US army [[bioweapon]] facility.  
Because the [[FBI]]’s anthrax investigation was closed against the  
advice of the lead [[FBI]] agent in the case, there are likely conspirators  
still working in the US [[government]]. In such a scenario the primary  
focus of stopping a [[bioweapon]]s attack must be to apprehend the  
conspirators or the attacks will never cease. Approving a [[vaccine]],  
utilizing novel [[RNA]] technology without extensive [[testing]] is  
extremely dangerous. The [[vaccine]] could be a [[bioweapon]] and even  
more dangerous than the original infection.
