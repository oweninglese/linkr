The Zionist Plan for 
the Middle East 


Translated and edited by 

[[Israel]] Shahak 


The [[Israel]] of Theodore Herzl ([[1904]]) 
and of Rabbi Fischmann ([[1947]]) 



In his Complete Diaries, Vol. II. p. 711, Theodore Herzl, the founder of Zionism, says that the area of 
the Jewish State stretches: "From the Brook of [[Egypt]] to the Euphrates." 

Rabbi Fischmann, member of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, declared in his testimony to the U.N. 
Special Committee of Enquiry on 9 [[July]] [[1947]]: "The Promised Land extends from the River of [[Egypt]] up 
to the Euphrates, it includes parts of Syria and [[Lebanon]]."

Publisher's Note 


1 


The Association of Arab-[[American]] [[University]] Graduates finds it compelling to inaugurate its new 
publication series, Special Documents, with Oded Yinon's article which appeared in Kivunim 
(Directions), the journal of the Department of Information of the World Zionist Organization. Oded 
Yinon is an [[Israel]]i journalist and was formerly attached to the Foreign Ministry of [[Israel]]. To our 
knowledge, this document is the most explicit, detailed and unambiguous statement to date of the 
Zionist strategy in the Middle East. Furthermore, it stands as an accurate representation of the "vision" 
for the entire Middle East of the presently ruling Zionist regime of Begin, Sharon and Eitan. Its 
importance, hence, lies not in its historical value but in the nightmare which it presents. 

2 


The plan operates on two essential premises. To survive, [[Israel]] must 1) become an imperial regional 
power, and 2) must effect the division of the whole area into small states by the dissolution of all 
existing Arab states. Small here will depend on the ethnic or sectarian composition of each state. 
Consequently, the Zionist hope is that sectarian-based states become [[Israel]]'s satellites and, ironically, its 
source of moral legitimation. 


3 


This is not a new idea, nor does it surface for the first time in Zionist strategic thinking. Indeed, 
fragmenting all Arab states into smaller units has been a recurrent theme. This theme has been 
documented on a very modest scale in the AAUG publication, [[Israel]]'s Sacred Terrorism ([[1980]]), by 
Livia Rokach. Based on the memoirs of Moshe Sharett, former [[Prime]] [[Minister]] of [[Israel]], Rokach's study 
documents, in convincing detail, the Zionist plan as it applies to [[Lebanon]] and as it was prepared in the 
mid-fifties. 


4 


The first massive [[Israel]]i invasion of [[Lebanon]] in [[1978]] bore this plan out to the minutest detail. The 
second and more barbaric and encompassing [[Israel]]i invasion of [[Lebanon]] on [[June]] 6, [[1982]], aims to effect 
certain parts of this plan which hopes to see not only [[Lebanon]], but Syria and Jordan as well, in 
fragments. This ought to make mockery of [[Israel]]i public claims regarding their desire for a strong and 
independent Lebanese central [[government]]. More accurately, they want a Lebanese central [[government]] 
that sanctions their regional imperialist designs by signing a peace [[treaty]] with them. They also seek 
acquiescence in their designs by the Syrian, Iraqi, Jordanian and other Arab [[government]]s as well as by 
the Palestinian people. What they want and what they are planning for is not an Arab world, but a world 
of Arab fragments that is ready to succumb to [[Israel]]i hegemony. Hence, Oded Yinon in his essay, "A 
Strategy for [[Israel]] in the [[1980]]'s," talks about "far-reaching opportunities for the first time since [[1967]]" 
that are created by the "very stormy situation [that] surrounds [[Israel]]." 

5 


The Zionist policy of displacing the Palestinians from Palestine is very much an active policy, but is 
pursued more forcefully in times of contlict, such as in the [[1947]]-[[1948]] war and in the [[1967]] war. An 
appendix entitled "[[Israel]] Talks of a New Exodus" is included in this publication to demonstrate past 
Zionist dispersals of Palestinians from their homeland and to show, besides the main Zionist document 
we present, other Zionist planning for the de-Palestinization of Palestine. 

6 


It is clear from the Kivunim document, published in Febmary, [[1982]], that the "far-reaching 
opportunities" of which Zionist strategists have been thinking are the same "opportunities" of which 
they are trying to convince the world and which they claim were generated by their [[June]], [[1982]] invasion. 
It is also clear that the Palestinians were never the sole target of Zionist plans, but the priority target 
since their viable and independent presence as a people negates the essence of the Zionist state. Every 
Arab state, however, especially those with cohesive and clear nationalist directions, is a real target 
sooner or later. 


7 


Contrasted with the detailed and unambiguous Zionist strategy elueidated in this doeument, Arab and 
Palestinian strategy, unfortunately, suffers from ambiguity and ineoherenee. There is no indieation that 
Arab strategists have internalized the Zionist plan in its full ramifieations. Instead, they reaet with 
ineredulity and shoek whenever a new stage of it unfolds. This is apparent in Arab reaetion, albeit 
muted, to the [[Israel]]i siege of Beirat. The sad faet is that as long as the Zionist strategy for the Middle 
East is not taken seriously Arab reaetion to any future siege of other Arab eapitals will be the same.

Foreward 


1 


The following essay represents, in my opinion, the aeeurate and detailed plan of the present Zionist 
regime (of Sharon and Eitan) for the Middle East whieh is based on the division of the whole area into 
small states, and the dissolution of all the existing Arab states. I will eomment on the military aspeet of 
this plan in a eoneluding note. Here I want to draw the attention of the readers to several important 
points: 


2 


1. The idea that all the Arab states should be broken down, by [[Israel]], into small units, oeeurs again and 
again in [[Israel]]i strategie thinking. For example, Ze'ev Sehiff, the military eorrespondent of Ha 'aretz 
(and probably the most knowledgeable in [[Israel]], on this topie) writes about the "best" that ean happen 
for [[Israel]]i interests in Iraq: "The dissolution of Iraq into a Shi'ite state, a Sunni state and the separation 
of the Kurdish part" (Ha'aretz 6/2/[[1982]]). Aetually, this aspeet of the plan is very old. 

3 


2. The strong eonneetion with Neo-Conservative thought in the [[USA]] is very prominent, espeeially in 
the author's notes. But, while lip serviee is paid to the idea of the "defense of the West" from [[Soviet]] 
power, the real aim of the author, and of the present [[Israel]]i establishment is elear: To make an Imperial 
[[Israel]] into a world power. In other words, the aim of Sharon is to deeeive the Amerieans after he has 
deeeived all the rest. 


4 


3. It is obvious that mueh of the relevant data, both in the notes and in the text, is garbled or omitted, 
such as the financial help of the U.S. to [[Israel]]. Mueh of it is pure fantasy. But, the plan is not to be 
regarded as not in[[flu]]ential, or as not eapable of realization for a short time. The plan follows faithfully 



the geopolitical ideas current in Germany of [[1890]]-[[1933]], which were swallowed whole by Hitler and the 
Nazi movement, and determined their aims for East [[Europe]]. Those aims, especially the division of the 
existing states, were carried out in [[1939]]-[[1941]], and only an [[alliance]] on the global scale prevented their 
consolidation for a period of time. 


5 


The notes by the author follow the text. To avoid confusion, I did not add any notes of my own, but 
have put the substance of them into this foreward and the conclusion at the end. I have, however, 
emphasized some portions of the text.

A Strategy for [[Israel]] in the Nineteen Eighties 


by Oded Yinon 


This essay originally appeared in Hebrew in KIVUNIM (Directions), A Journal for Judaism and 
Zionism; Issue No, 14â€”Winter, 5742, [[February]] [[1982]], Editor: Yoram Beck. Editorial Committee: Eli 
Eyal, Yoram Beck, Amnon Hadari, Yohanan Manor, Elieser Schweid. Published by the Department of 
Publicity/The World Zionist Organization, Jerusalem. 


1 


At the outset of the nineteen eighties the State of [[Israel]] is in need of a new perspective as to its place, its 
aims and national targets, at home and abroad. This need has become even more vital due to a number 
of central processes which the country, the region and the world are undergoing. We are living today in 
the early stages of a new epoch in human [[history]] which is not at all similar to its predecessor, and its 
characteristics are totally different from what we have hitherto known. That is why we need an 
understanding of the central processes which typify this historical epoch on the one hand, and on the 
other hand we need a world outlook and an operational strategy in accordance with the new conditions. 
The existence, prosperity and steadfastness of the Jewish state will depend upon its ability to adopt a 
new framework for its domestic and foreign affairs. 


2 


This epoch is characterized by several traits which we can already diagnose, and which symbolize a 
genuine [[revolution]] in our present lifestyle. The dominant process is the breakdown of the rationalist, 
humanist outlook as the major cornerstone supporting the life and achievements of [[Western]] civilization 



since the Renaissance. The political, social and economic views which have emanated from this 
foundation have been based on several "truths" which are presently disappearingâ€”for example, the view 
that man as an individual is the center of the universe and everything exists in order to fulfdl his basic 
material needs. This position is being invalidated in the present when it has become clear that the 
amount of resources in the cosmos does not meet Man's requirements, his economic needs or his 
demographic constraints. In a world in which there are four billion human beings and economic and 
energy resources which do not grow proportionally to meet the needs of mankind, it is unrealistic to 
expect to fulfdl the main requirement of [[Western]] Society,* i.e., the wish and aspiration for boundless 
consumption. The view that ethics plays no part in determining the direction Man takes, but rather his 
material needs doâ€”that view is becoming prevalent today as we see a world in which nearly all values 
are disappearing. We are losing the ability to assess the simplest things, especially when they concern 
the simple question of what is Good and what is Evil. 

3 


The vision of man's limitless aspirations and abilities shrinks in the face of the sad facts of life, when we 
witness the break-up of world order around us. The view which promises [[liberty]] and freedom to 
mankind seems absurd in light of the sad fact that three fourths of the human race lives under 
totalitarian regimes. The views concerning equality and social justice have been transfomied by 
socialism and especially by Communism into a laughing stock. There is no argument as to the truth of 
these two ideas, but it is clear that they have not been put into practice properly and the majority of 
mankind has lost the [[liberty]], the freedom and the opportunity for equality and justice. In this [[nuclear]] 
world in which we are (still) living in relative peace for thirty years, the concept of peace and 
coexistence among nations has no meaning when a superpower like the USSR holds a military and 
political doctrine of the sort it has: that not only is a [[nuclear]] war possible and necessary in order to 
achieve the ends of Marxism, but that it is possible to survive after it, not to speak of the fact that one 
can be victorious in it.^ 


4 


The essential concepts of human society, especially those of the West, are undergoing a change due to 
political, military and economic transfomiations. Thus, the [[nuclear]] and conventional might of the USSR 
has transformed the epoch that has just ended into the last respite before the great saga that will 
demolish a large part of our world in a multi-dimensional global war, in comparison with which the past 
world wars will have been mere [[child]]'s play. The power of [[nuclear]] as well as of conventional weapons, 
their quantity, their precision and quality will turn most of our world upside down within a few years, 
and we must align ourselves so as to face that in [[Israel]]. That is, then, the main threat to our existence 
and that of the [[Western]] world.^ The war over resources in the world, the Arab monopoly on oil, and the 
need of the West to import most of its raw materials from the Third World, are transforming the world 
we know, given that one of the major aims of the USSR is to defeat the West by gaining control over 
the gigantic resources in the Persian Gulf and in the southern part of [[Africa]], in which the majority of 
world minerals are located. We can imagine the dimensions of the global confrontation which will face 
us in the future. 


5 


The Gorshkov doctrine calls for [[Soviet]] control of the oceans and mineral rich areas of the Third World. 
That together with the present [[Soviet]] [[nuclear]] doctrine which holds that it is possible to manage, win and 
survive a [[nuclear]] war, in the course of which the West's military might well be destroyed and its 
inhabitants made [[slaves]] in the service of Marxism-Leninism, is the main danger to world peace and to 
our own existence. Since [[1967]], the [[Soviet]]s have transformed Clausewitz' dictum into "[[War]] is the 
continuation of policy in [[nuclear]] means," and made it the motto which guides all their policies. Already 
today they are busy carrying out their aims in our region and throughout the world, and the need to face 
them becomes the major element in our country's security policy and of course that of the rest of the 
Free World. That is our major foreign challenge.'' 


6 


The Arab Moslem world, therefore, is not the major strategic problem which we shall face in the 
Eighties, despite the fact that it carries the main threat against [[Israel]], due to its growing military might. 
This world, with its ethnic minorities, its factions and internal crises, which is astonishingly selfÂ¬ 
destructive, as we can see in [[Lebanon]], in non-Arab [[Iran]] and now also in Syria, is unable to deal 
successfully with its fundamental problems and does not therefore constitute a real threat against the 
State of [[Israel]] in the long run, but only in the short run where its immediate military power has great 
import. In the long run, this world will be unable to exist within its present framework in the areas 
around us without having to go through genuine [[revolution]]ary changes. The Moslem Arab World is 
built like a temporary house of cards put together by foreigners ([[France]] and [[Britain]] in the Nineteen 
Twenties), without the wishes and desires of the inhabitants having been taken into account. It was 
arbitrarily divided into 19 states, all made of combinations of minorites and ethnic groups which are 
hostile to one another, so that every Arab Moslem state nowadays faces ethnic social destruction from 
within, and in some a civil war is already raging.^ Most of the Arabs, 118 million out of 170 million, 
live in [[Africa]], mostly in [[Egypt]] (45 million today). 


7 


Apart from [[Egypt]], all the Maghreb states are made up of a mixture of Arabs and non-Arab Berbers. In 
[[Algeria]] there is already a civil war raging in the Kabile mountains between the two nations in the 
country. Morocco and [[Algeria]] are at war with each other over [[Spanish]] Sahara, in addition to the internal 
struggle in each of them. Militant Islam endangers the integrity of Tunisia and Qaddafi organizes wars 
which are destructive from the Arab point of view, from a country which is sparsely populated and 
which cannot become a powerful nation. That is why he has been attempting unifications in the past 
with states that are more genuine, like [[Egypt]] and Syria. Sudan, the most torn apart state in the Arab 
Moslem world today is built upon four groups hostile to each other, an Arab Moslem Sunni minority 
which rules over a majority of non-Arab [[Africa]]ns, Pagans, and Christians. In [[Egypt]] there is a Sunni 
Moslem majority facing a large minority of Christians which is dominant in upper [[Egypt]]: some 7 
million of them, so that even Sadat, in his speech on [[May]] 8, expressed the fear that they will want a 
state of their own, something like a "second" Christian [[Lebanon]] in [[Egypt]]. 


8 


All the Arab [[States]] east of [[Israel]] are tom apart, broken up and riddled with inner conflict even more 
than those of the Maghreb. Syria is fundamentally no different from [[Lebanon]] except in the strong 
military regime which rales it. But the real civil war taking place nowadays between the Sunni majority 
and the Shi'ite Alawi ruling minority (a mere 12% of the population) testifies to the severity of the 
domestic trouble. 


9 


Iraq is, once again, no different in essence from its neighbors, although its majority is Shi'ite and the 
ruling minority Sunni. Sixty-five percent of the population has no say in politics, in which an elite of 20 
percent holds the power. In addition there is a large Kurdish minority in the north, and if it weren't for 
the strength of the ruling regime, the army and the oil revenues, Iraq's future state would be no different 
than that of [[Lebanon]] in the past or of Syria today. The seeds of inner conflict and civil war are apparent 
today already, especially after the rise of Khomeini to power in [[Iran]], a leader whom the Shi'ites in Iraq 
view as their natural leader. 


10 


All the Gulf principalities and [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] are built upon a delicate house of sand in which there is 
only oil. In Kuwait, the Kuwaitis constitute only a quarter of the population. In Bahrain, the Shi'ites are 
the majority but are deprived of power. In the UAL, Shi'ites are once again the majority but the Sunnis 
are in power. The same is true of [[Oman]] and North Yemen. Even in the Marxist South Yemen there is a 
sizable Shi'ite minority. In [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]] half the population is foreign, [[Egypt]]ian and Yemenite, but a 
[[Saudi]] minority holds power. 


11 


Jordan is in reality Palestinian, ruled by a Trans-Jordanian Bedouin minority, but most of the army and 
certainly the bureaucracy is now Palestinian. As a matter of fact Amman is as Palestinian as Nablus. All 
of these countries have powerful armies, relatively speaking. But there is a problem there too. The 
Syrian army today is mostly Sunni with an Alawi officer corps, the Iraqi army Shi'ite with Sunni 
commanders. This has great significance in the long ran, and that is why it will not be possible to retain 
the loyalty of the army for a long time except where it comes to the only common denominator: The 
hostility towards [[Israel]], and today even that is insufficient. 

12 


Alongside the Arabs, split as they are, the other Moslem states share a similar predicament. Half of 
[[Iran]]'s population is comprised of a Persian speaking group and the other half of an ethnically Turkish 
group. [[Turkey]]'s population comprises a Turkish Sunni Moslem majority, some 50%, and two large 
minorities, 12 million Shi'ite Alawis and 6 million Sunni Kurds. In Afghanistan there are 5 million 



Shi'ites who constitute one third of the population. In Sunni [[Pakistan]] there are 15 million Shi'ites who 
endanger the existence of that state. 


13 


This national ethnic minority picture extending from Morocco to India and from Somalia to [[Turkey]] 
points to the absence of stability and a rapid degeneration in the entire region. When this picture is 
added to the economic one, we see how the entire region is built like a house of cards, unable to 
withstand its severe problems. 


14 


In this giant and fractured world there are a few wealthy groups and a huge mass of poor people. Most 
of the Arabs have an average yearly income of 300 dollars. That is the situation in [[Egypt]], in most of the 
Maghreb countries except for [[Libya]], and in Iraq. [[Lebanon]] is tom apart and its economy is falling to 
pieces. It is a state in which there is no centralized power, but only 5 de facto sovereign authorities 
(Christian in the north, supported by the Syrians and under the mle of the Franjieh clan, in the East an 
area of direct Syrian conquest, in the center a Phalangist controlled Christian enclave, in the south and 
up to the Litani river a mostly Palestinian region controlled by the PLO and Major Haddad's state of 
Christians and half a million Shi'ites). Syria is in an even graver situation and even the assistance she 
will obtain in the future after the unification with [[Libya]] will not be sufficient for dealing with the basic 
problems of existence and the maintenance of a large army. [[Egypt]] is in the worst situation: Millions are 
on the verge of hunger, half the labor force is unemployed, and housing is scarce in this most densely 
populated area of the world. Except for the army, there is not a single department operating efficiently 
and the state is in a permanent state of bankruptcy and depends entirely on [[American]] foreign assistance 
granted since the peace.Â® 


15 


In the Gulf states, [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]] there is the largest accumulation of money and oil in 
the world, but those enjoying it are tiny elites who lack a wide base of support and self-confidence, 
something that no army can guarantee.â€™ The [[Saudi]] army with all its equipment cannot defend the regime 
from real dangers at home or abroad, and what took place in Mecca in [[1980]] is only an example. A sad 
and very stormy situation surrounds [[Israel]] and creates challenges for it, problems, risks but also far- 
reaching opportunities for the first time since [[1967]]. Chances are that opportunities missed at that time 
will become achievable in the Eighties to an extent and along dimensions which we cannot even 
imagine today. 


16 


The "peace" policy and the return of territories, through a dependence upon the US, precludes the 
realization of the new option created for us. Since [[1967]], all the [[government]]s of [[Israel]] have tied our 
national aims down to narrow political needs, on the one hand, and on the other to destructive opinions 


at home which neutralized our capacities both at home and abroad. Failing to take steps towards the 
Arab population in the new territories, acquired in the course of a war forced upon us, is the major 
strategic error committed by [[Israel]] on the morning after the Six Day [[War]]. We could have saved 
ourselves all the bitter and dangerous conflict since then if we had given Jordan to the Palestinians who 
live west of the Jordan river. By doing that we would have neutralized the Palestinian problem which 
we nowadays face, and to which we have found solutions that are really no solutions at all, such as 
territorial compromise or autonomy which amount, in fact, to the same thing.* Today, we suddenly face 
immense opportunities for transforming the situation thoroughly and this we must do in the coming 
decade, otherwise we shall not survive as a state. 


17 


In the course of the Nineteen Eighties, the State of [[Israel]] will have to go through far-reaching changes 
in its political and economic regime domestically, along with radical changes in its foreign policy, in 
order to stand up to the global and regional challenges of this new epoch. The loss of the Suez Canal oil 
fields, of the immense potential of the oil, gas and other natural resources in the Sinai peninsula which 
is geomorphologically identical to the rich oil-producing countries in the region, will result in an energy 
drain in the near future and will destroy our domestic economy: one quarter of our present GNP as well 
as one third of the budget is used for the purchase of oil.^ The search for raw materials in the Negev and 
on the coast will not, in the near future, serve to alter that state of affairs. 

18 


(Regaining) the Sinai peninsula with its present and potential resources is therefore a political priority 
which is obstructed by the Camp David and the peace agreements. The fault for that lies of course with 
the present [[Israel]]i [[government]] and the [[government]]s which paved the road to the policy of territorial 
compromise, the Alignment [[government]]s since [[1967]]. The [[Egypt]]ians will not need to keep the peace 
[[treaty]] after the return of the Sinai, and they will do all they can to return to the fold of the Arab world 
and to the USSR in order to gain support and military assistance. [[American]] aid is guaranteed only for a 
short while, for the terms of the peace and the weakening of the U.S. both at home and abroad will bring 
about a reduction in aid. Without oil and the income from it, with the present enormous expenditure, we 
will not be able to get through [[1982]] under the present conditions and we will have to act in order to 
return the situation to the status quo which existed in Sinai prior to Sadat's visit and the mistaken peace 
agreement signed with him in March 7979.*** 


19 


[[Israel]] has two major routes through which to realize this purpose, one direct and the other indirect. The 
direct option is the less realistic one because of the nature of the regime and [[government]] in [[Israel]] as 
well as the wisdom of Sadat who obtained our withdrawal from Sinai, which was, next to the war of 
[[1973]], his major achievement since he took power. [[Israel]] will not unilaterally break the [[treaty]], neither 
today, nor in [[1982]], unless it is very hard pressed economically and politically and [[Egypt]] provides [[Israel]] 
with the excuse to take the Sinai back into our hands for the fourth time in our short [[history]]. What is left 
therefore, is the indirect option. The economic situation in [[Egypt]], the nature of the regime and its pan- 


Arab policy, will bring about a situation after [[April]] [[1982]] in which [[Israel]] will be forced to act directly or 
indirectly in order to regain control over Sinai as a strategic, economic and energy reserve for the long 
run. [[Egypt]] does not constitute a military strategic problem due to its internal conflicts and it could be 
driven back to the post [[1967]] war situation in no more than one day." 

20 


The myth of [[Egypt]] as the strong leader of the Arab World was demolished back in [[1956]] and definitely 
did not survive [[1967]], but our policy, as in the return of the Sinai, served to turn the myth into "fact." In 
reality, however, [[Egypt]]'s power in proportion both to [[Israel]] alone and to the rest of the Arab World has 
gone down about 50 percent since [[1967]]. [[Egypt]] is no longer the leading political power in the Arab 
World and is economically on the verge of a crisis. Without foreign assistance the crisis will come 
tomorrow. " In the short run, due to the return of the Sinai, [[Egypt]] will gain several advantages at our 
expense, but only in the short mn until [[1982]], and that will not change the balance of power to its 
benefit, and will possibly bring about its downfall. [[Egypt]], in its present domestic political picture, is 
already a corpse, all the more so if we take into account the growing Moslem-Christian rift. [[Breaking]] 
[[Egypt]] down territorially into distinct geographical regions is the political aim of [[Israel]] in the Nineteen 
Eighties on its [[Western]] front. 


21 


[[Egypt]] is divided and tom apart into many foci of authority. If [[Egypt]] falls apart, countries like [[Libya]], 
Sudan or even the more distant states will not continue to exist in their present form and will join the 
downfall and dissolution of [[Egypt]]. The vision of a Christian Coptic State in Upper [[Egypt]] alongside a 
number of weak states with very localized power and without a centralized [[government]] as to date, is the 
key to a historical development which was only set hack by the peace agreement but which seems 
inevitable in the long run.^^ 


22 


The [[Western]] front, which on the surface appears more problematic, is in fact less complicated than the 
[[Eastern]] front, in which most of the events that make the headlines have been taking place recently. 
[[Lebanon]]'s total dissolution into five provinces serves as a precendent for the entire Arab world 
including [[Egypt]], Syria, Iraq and the [[Arabia]]n peninsula and is already following that track. The 
dissolution of Syria and Iraq later on into ethnically or religiously unqiue areas such as in [[Lebanon]], is 
[[Israel]]'s primary target on the [[Eastern]] front in the long run, while the dissolution of the military power 
of those states serves as the primary short term target. Syria will fall apart, in accordance with its 
ethnic and religious structure, into several states such as in present day [[Lebanon]], so that there will he a 
Shi'ite Alawi state along its coast, a Sunni state in the Aleppo area, another Sunni state in Damascus 
hostile to its northern neighbor, and the Druzes who will set up a state, maybe even in our Golan, and 
certainly in the Hauran and in northern Jordan. This state of affairs will be the guarantee for peace and 
security in the area in the long run, and that aim is already within our reach today. 


Iraq, rich in oil on the one hand and internally torn on the other, is guaranteed as a candidate for 
[[Israel]]'s targets. Its dissolution is even more important for us than that of Syria. Iraq is stronger than 
Syria. In the short run it is Iraqi power which constitutes the greatest threat to [[Israel]]. An Iraqi-[[Iran]]ian 
war will tear Iraq apart and cause its downfall at home even before it is able to organize a struggle on a 
wide front against us. Every kind of inter-Arab confrontation will assist us in the short run and will 
shorten the way to the more important aim of breaking up Iraq into denominations as in Syria and in 
[[Lebanon]]. In Iraq, a division into provinces along ethnic/religious lines as in Syria during Ottoman times 
is possible. So, three (or more) states will exist around the three major cities: Basra, Baghdad and 
Mosul, and Shi'ite areas in the south will separate from the Sunni and Kurdish north. It is possible that 
the present [[Iran]]ian-Iraqi confrontation will deepen this polarization.'^ 

24 


The entire [[Arabia]]n peninsula is a natural candidate for dissolution due to internal and external 
pressures, and the matter is inevitable especially in [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]]. Regardless of whether its economic 
might based on oil remains intact or whether it is diminished in the long run, the internal rifts and 
breakdowns are a clear and natural development in light of the present political structure.'Â® 

25 


Jordan constitutes an immediate strategic target in the short run but not in the long run, for it does not 
constitute a real threat in the long run after its dissolution, the termination of the lengthy rule of [[King]] 
Hussein and the transfer of power to the Palestinians in the short run. 

26 


There is no chance that Jordan will continue to exist in its present structure for a long time, and [[Israel]]'s 
policy, both in war and in peace, ought to be directed at the liquidation of Jordan under the present 
regime and the transfer of power to the Palestinian majority. Changing the regime east of the river will 
also cause the termination of the problem of the territories densely populated with Arabs west of the 
Jordan. Whether in war or under conditions of peace, emigrationfrom the territories and economic 
demographic freeze in them, are the guarantees for the coming change on both banks of the river, and 
we ought to be active in order to accelerate this process in the nearest future. The autonomy plan ought 
also to be rejected, as well as any compromise or division of the territories for, given the plans of the 
PLO and those of the [[Israel]]i Arabs themselves, the Shefa'amr plan of [[September]] [[1980]], it is not possible 
to go on living in this country in the present situation without separating the two nations, the Arabs to 
Jordan and the Jews to the areas west of the river. Genuine coexistence and peace will reign over the 
land only when the Arabs understand that without Jewish rule between the Jordan and the sea they will 
have neither existence nor security. A nation of their own and security will be theirs only in Jordan.'^ 


27 


Within [[Israel]] the distinetion between the areas of '67 and the territories beyond them, those of '48, has 
always been meaningless for Arabs and nowadays no longer has any signifieanee for us. The problem 
should be seen in its entirety without any divisions as of '67. It should be elear, under any future 
politieal situation or mifitary eonstellation, that the solution of the problem of the [[indigenous]] Arabs will 
eome only when they reeognize the existenee of [[Israel]] in seeure borders up to the Jordan river and 
beyond it, as our existential need in this diffieult epoeh, the nuelear epoeh whieh we shall soon enter. It 
is no longer possible to live with three fourths of the Jewish population on the dense shoreline whieh is 
so dangerous in a nuelear epoeh. 


28 


Dispersal of the population is therefore a domestie strategie aim of the highest order; otherwise, we 
shall eease to exist within any borders. Judea, Samaria and the Galilee are our sole guarantee for 
national existenee, and if we do not beeome the majority in the mountain areas, we shall not rule in the 
eountry and we shall be like the Crusaders, who lost this eountry whieh was not theirs anyhow, and in 
whieh they were foreigners to begin with. Rebalaneing the eountry demographieally, strategieally and 
eeonomieally is the highest and most eentral aim today. Taking hold of the mountain watershed from 
Beersheba to the Upper Galilee is the national aim generated by the major strategie eonsideration whieh 
is settling the mountainous part of the eountry that is empty of Jews today 

29 


Realizing our aims on the [[Eastern]] front depends first on the realization of this internal strategie 
objeetive. The transformation of the politieal and eeonomie stmeture, so as to enable the realization of 
these strategie aims, is the key to aehieving the entire ehange. We need to ehange from a eentralized 
eeonomy in whieh the [[government]] is extensively involved, to an open and free market as well as to 
switeh from depending upon the U.S. taxpayer to developing, with our own hands, of a genuine 
produetive eeonomie infrastrueture. If we are not able to make this ehange freely and voluntarily, we 
shall be foreed into it by world developments, espeeially in the areas of eeonomies, energy, and polities, 
and by our own growing isolation.*Â® 


30 


From a military and strategie point of view, the West led by the U.S. is unable to withstand the global 
pressures of the USSR throughout the world, and [[Israel]] must therefore stand alone in the Eighties, 
without any foreign assistanee, military or eeonomie, and this is within our capacities today, with no 
compromises.^'^ Rapid changes in the world will also bring about a change in the condition of world 
Jewry to which [[Israel]] will become not only a last resort but the only existential option. We cannot 
assume that U.S. Jews, and the communities of [[Europe]] and Latin America will continue to exist in the 
present form in the future^' 


31 


Our existence in this country itself is certain, and there is no force that could remove us from here either 
forcefully or by treachery (Sadat's method). Despite the difficulties of the mistaken "peace" policy and 
the problem of the [[Israel]]i Arabs and those of the territories, we can effectively deal with these problems 
in the foreseeable future. 


Conclusion 


1 


Three important points have to be clarified in order to be able to understand the significant possibilities 
of realization of this Zionist plan for the Middle East, and also why it had to be published. 

2 


The Military Background of The Plan 

The military conditions of this plan have not been mentioned above, but on the many occasions where 
something very like it is being "explained" in closed meetings to members of the [[Israel]]i Establishment, 
this point is clarified. It is assumed that the [[Israel]]i military forces, in all their branches, are insufficient 
for the actual work of occupation of such wide territories as discussed above. In fact, even in times of 
intense Palestinian "unrest" on the West Bank, the forces of the [[Israel]]i Army are stretched out too much. 
The answer to that is the method of ruling by means of "Haddad forces" or of "Village Associations" 
(also known as "Village Leagues"): local forces under "leaders" completely dissociated from the 
population, not having even any feudal or party structure (such as the Phalangists have, for example). 
The "states" proposed by Yinon are "Haddadland" and "Village Associations," and their armed forces 
will be, no doubt, quite similar. In addition, [[Israel]]i military superiority in such a situation will be much 
greater than it is even now, so that any movement of revolt will be "punished" either by mass 
humiliation as in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, or by [[bomb]]ardment and obliteration of cities, as in 
[[Lebanon]] now ([[June]] [[1982]]), or by both. In order to ensure this, the plan, as explained orally, calls for the 
establishment of [[Israel]]i garrisons in focal places between the mini states, equipped with the necessary 
mobile destructive forces. In fact, we have seen something like this in Haddadland and we will almost 
certainly soon see the first example of this system functioning either in South [[Lebanon]] or in all 
[[Lebanon]]. 


3 


It is obvious that the above military assumptions, and the whole plan too, depend also on the Arabs 
continuing to be even more divided than they are now, and on the lack of any truly progressive mass 
movement among them. It may be that those two conditions will be removed only when the plan will be 
well advanced, with consequences which can not be foreseen. 



4 


Why it is necessary to publish this in [[Israel]]? 

The reason for publication is the dual nature of the [[Israel]]i-Jewish society: A very great measure of 
freedom and democracy, specially for Jews, combined with expansionism and racist discrimination. In 
such a situation the [[Israel]]i-Jewish elite (for the masses follow the TV and Begin's speeches) has to be 
persuaded. The first steps in the process of persuasion are oral, as indicated above, but a time comes in 
which it becomes inconvenient. Written material must be produced for the benefit of the more stupid 
"persuaders" and "explainers" (for example medium-rank officers, who are, usually, remarkably stupid). 
They then "learn it," more or less, and preach to others. It should be remarked that [[Israel]], and even the 
Yishuv from the Twenties, has always functioned in this way. I myself well remember how (before I 
was "in opposition") the necessity of war with was explained to me and others a year before the [[1956]] 
war, and the necessity of [[conquer]]ing "the rest of [[Western]] Palestine when we will have the opportunity" 
was explained in the years [[1965]]-67. 


5 


Why is it assumed that there is no special risk from the outside in the publication of such plans? 

Such risks can come from two sources, so long as the principled opposition inside [[Israel]] is very weak (a 
situation which may change as a consequence of the war on [[Lebanon]]) : The Arab World, including the 
Palestinians, and the [[United]] [[States]]. The Arab World has shown itself so far quite incapable of a detailed 
and rational analysis of [[Israel]]i-Jewish society, and the Palestinians have been, on the average, no better 
than the rest. In such a situation, even those who are shouting about the dangers of [[Israel]]i expansionism 
(which are real enough) are doing this not because of factual and detailed knowledge, but because of 
belief in myth. A good example is the very persistent belief in the non-existent writing on the wall of 
the Knesset of the Biblical verse about the Nile and the Euphrates. Another example is the persistent, 
and completely false declarations, which were made by some of the most important Arab leaders, that 
the two blue stripes of the [[Israel]]i flag symbolize the Nile and the Euphrates, while in fact they are taken 
from the stripes of the Jewish praying shawl (Talit). The [[Israel]]i specialists assume that, on the whole, 
the Arabs will pay no attention to their serious discussions of the future, and the [[Lebanon]] war has 
proved them right. So why should they not continue with their old methods of persuading other [[Israel]]is? 

6 


In the [[United]] [[States]] a very similar situation exists, at least until now. The more or less serious 
commentators take their information about [[Israel]], and much of their opinions about it, from two 
sources. The first is from articles in the "liberal" [[American]] press, written almost totally by Jewish 
admirers of [[Israel]] who, even if they are critical of some aspects of the [[Israel]]i state, practice loyally what 
Stalin used to call "the constructive criticism." (In fact those among them who claim also to be "Anti- 
Stalinist" are in reality more Stalinist than Stalin, with [[Israel]] being their god which has not yet failed). 
In the framework of such critical worship it must be assumed that [[Israel]] has always "good intentions" 
and only "makes mistakes," and therefore such a plan would not be a matter for discussionâ€”exactly as 
the Biblical genocides committed by Jews are not mentioned. The other source of information. The 
Jerusalem Post, has similar policies. So long, therefore, as the situation exists in which [[Israel]] is really a 



"closed society" to the rest of the world, because the world wants to close its eyes, the publication and 
even the beginning of the realization of such a plan is realistic and feasible.

Notes 


1. [[American]] Universities Field Staff. Report No.33, [[1979]]. According to this research, the population of the world 
will be 6 billion in the year 2000. Today's world population can be broken down as follows: [[China]], 958 million; 
India, 635 million; USSR, 261 million; U.S., 218 million [[Indonesia]], 140 million; Brazil and Japan, 110 million 
each. According to the figures of the U.N. Population Fund for [[1980]], there will be, in 2000, 50 cities with a 
population of over 5 million each. The population ofthp;Third World will then be 80% of the world population. 
According to Justin Blackwelder, U.S. Census Office chief, the world population will not reach 6 billion because of 
hunger. 

2. [[Soviet]] [[nuclear]] policy has been well summarized by two [[American]] [[Soviet]]ologists: Joseph D. Douglas and 
Amoretta M. Hoeber, [[Soviet]] Strategy for Nuclear [[War]], (Stanford, Ca., Hoover Inst. Press, [[1979]]). In the [[Soviet]] 
Union tens and hundreds of articles and books are published each year which detail the [[Soviet]] doctrine for [[nuclear]] 
war and there is a great deal of documentation translated into English and published by the U.S. Air Force,including 
[[USA]]F: Marxism-Leninism on [[War]] and the Army: The [[Soviet]] View, Moscow, [[1972]]; [[USA]]F: The Armed Forces of 
the [[Soviet]] State. Moscow, [[1975]], by Marshal A. Grechko. The basic [[Soviet]] approach to the matter is presented in the 
book by Marshal Sokolovski published in [[1962]] in Moscow: Marshal V. D. Sokolovski, Military Strategy, [[Soviet]] 
Doctrine and CoÂ«cepA(New York, Praeger, [[1963]]).

8. In his book, former [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Yitzhak Rabin said that the [[Israel]]i [[government]] is in fact responsible for the 
design of [[American]] policy in the Middle East, after [[June]] '67, because of its own indecisiveness as to the future of 
the territories and the inconsistency in its positions since it established the background for Resolution 242 and 
certainly twelve years later for the Camp David agreements and the peace [[treaty]] with [[Egypt]]. According to Rabin, 
on [[June]] 19, [[1967]], [[President]] Johnson sent a letter to [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Eshkol in which he did not mention anything 
about withdrawal from the new territories but exactly on the same day the [[government]] resolved to return territories 
in exchange for peace. After the Arab resolutions in Khartoum (9/1/67) the [[government]] altered its position but 
contrary to its decision of [[June]] 19, did not notify the U.S. of the alteration and the U.S. continued to support 242 in 
the Security Council on the basis of its earlier understanding that [[Israel]] is prepared to return territories. At that point 
it was already too late to change the U.S. position and [[Israel]]'s policy. From here the way was opened to peace 
agreements on the basis of 242 as was later agreed upon in Camp David. See Yitzhak Rabin. Pinkas Sherut, 
(Ma'ariv [[1979]]) pp. 226-227. 

9. Foreign and Defense Committee Chairman Prof. Moshe Arens argued in an interview (Ma 'an'v, 10/3/80) that the 
[[Israel]]i [[government]] failed to prepare an economic plan before the Camp David agreements and was itself surprised 
by the cost of the agreements, although already during the negotiations it was possible to calculate the heavy price 
and the serious error involved in not having prepared the economic grounds for peace. 

The former [[Minister]] of Treasury, Mr. Yigal Holwitz, stated that if it were not for the withdrawal from the oil fields, 
[[Israel]] would have a positive balance of payments (9/17/80). That same person said two years earlier that the 
[[government]] of [[Israel]] (from which he withdrew) had placed a noose around his neck. He was referring to the Camp 
David agreements (Ha'aretz, 11/3/78). In the course of the whole peace negotiations neither an expert nor an 
economics advisor was consulted, and the [[Prime]] [[Minister]] himself, who lacks knowledge and expertise in 
economics, in a mistaken initiative, asked the U.S. to give us a loan rather than a grant, due to his wish to maintain 
our respect and the respect of the U.S. towards us. See Ha'aretz\lâ€˜ill9. Jerusalem Post, 9/7/79. Prof Asaf Razin, 
formerly a senior consultant in the Treasury, strongly criticized the conduct of the negotiations; Ha'aretz, 5/5/79. 
Ma'ariv, 9/7/79. As to matters concerning the oil fields and [[Israel]]'s energy crisis, see the interview with Mr. Eitan 
Eisenberg, a [[government]] advisor on these matters, Ma'arive Weekly, 12/12/78. The Energy [[Minister]], who 
personally signed the Camp David agreements and the evacuation of Sdeh Alma, has since emphasized the 
seriousness of our condition from the point of view of oil supplies more than once...see Yediot Ahronot, 7/20/79. 
Energy [[Minister]] Modai even admitted that the [[government]] did not consult him at all on the subject of oil during the 
Camp David and Blair House negotiations. Ha'aretz, 8/22/79. 

10. Many sources report on the growth of the armaments budget in [[Egypt]] and on intentions to give the army 
preference in a peace epoch budget over domestic needs for which a peace was allegedly obtained. See former 
[[Prime]] [[Minister]] Mamduh Salam in an interview 12/18/77, Treasury [[Minister]] Abd El Sayeh in an interview 7/25/78, 
and the paper Al Akhbar, 12/2/78 which clearly stressed that the military budget will receive first priority, despite 
the peace. This is what former [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Mustafa Khalil has stated in his cabinet's programmatic document 
which was presented to Parliament, 11/25/78. See English translation, ICA, [[FBI]]S, Nov. 27. [[1978]], pp. D 1-10. 


According to these sources, [[Egypt]]'s military budget increased by 10% between fiscal [[1977]] and [[1978]], and the 
process still goes on. A [[Saudi]] source divulged that the [[Egypt]]ians plan to increase their militmy budget by 100% in 
the next two years; Ha'aretz, 2/12/79 mA Jerusalem Post, 1/14/79. 

11. Most of the economic estimates threw doubt on [[Egypt]]'s ability to reconstruct its economy by [[1982]]. See 
Economic Intelligence Unit, [[1978]] Supplement, "The Arab Republic of [[Egypt]]"; E. Kanovsky, "Recent Economic 
Developments in the Middle East," Occasional Papers, The Shiloah Institution, [[June]] [[1977]]; Kanovsky, "The

increase in anti-Semitic incidents which were reported in that article. For the new anti-Semitism, see L. Talmon,
