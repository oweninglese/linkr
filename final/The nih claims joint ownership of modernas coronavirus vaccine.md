The National Institutes of Health may own intellectual [[property]] that undergirds a leading [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]] being developed by [[Moderna]], according to [documents obtained by Axios](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6935295-[[NIH]]-[[Moderna]]-Confidential-Agreements.html) and an [analysis from Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org/article/the-nih-[[vaccine]]/).

**Why it matters:** Because the federal [[government]] has an actual stake in this [[vaccine]], it could try to make the [[vaccine]] a free or low-cost public good with wide distribution, if the product turns out to be safe and effective.

**The big picture:** The [[NIH]] mostly funds outside research, but it also often [invents](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2785) basic scientific technologies that are later [licensed out](https://www.ott.nih.gov/news/nih-technology-licensed-merck-hpv-[[vaccine]]) and incorporated into [[drugs]] that are sold at massive profits. The agency [rarely](https://www.axios.com/gilead-hhs-lawsuit-hiv-[[drugs]]-patent-truvada-descovy-c2858321-8079-40e1-b131-0131f96[[1861]]8.html) claims ownership stakes or pursues patent rights, but that appears to be different with this [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]].

-   "We do have some particular stake in the intellectual [[property]]" behind [[Moderna]]'s [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]], [[NIH]] Director Francis Collins said during an [Economic Club interview](https://www.economicclub.org/events/dr-francis-collins-chris-nassetta-and-mary-brady) in [[May]].

**Driving the news:** New evidence shines light on the extent of [[NIH]]'s involvement.

-   [[NIH]] and [[Moderna]] have researched [[corona[[virus]]]]es, like MERS, for several years, and [signed a contract](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6935295-[[NIH]]-[[Moderna]]-Confidential-Agreements.html#document/p105/a568569) this past [[December]] that stated "m[[RNA]] [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]] candidates \[are\] developed and jointly owned" by the two parties. The contract was not specific to the novel [[corona[[virus]]]], and it was signed before the new [[virus]] had been [sequenced](https://www.[[science]]mag.org/news/[[2020]]/01/chinese-researchers-reveal-draft-genome-[[virus]]-implicated-wuhan-pneumonia-outbreak).
-   Separately, four [[NIH]] scientists have filed for a provisional patent application entitled "[[2019]]-nCoV [[vaccine]]," according to disclosures in a [pending scientific paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/[[2020]].06.11.145920v1.full.pdf). [[Moderna]] scientists co-authored that paper, but none are listed as [[vaccine]] co-inventors.
-   That makes it clear "the [[government]] and the public have a stake" in the [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]], said Zain Rizvi, a health law and policy researcher at Public Citizen. "The [[vaccine]] would not exist without the intellectual contributions of federal scientists."

**What they're saying:** [[NIH]] said in a [statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6956323-[[NIH]]-Statement-to-Axios.html) that its scientists created the "stabilized [[corona[[virus]]]] [spike proteins](https://www.ott.nih.gov/technology/e-234-[[2016]]) for the development of [[vaccine]]s against [[corona[[virus]]]]es, including SARS-CoV-2," and the [[government]] consequently has "sought patents to preserve the [[government]]'s rights to these inventions."

-   Further, [[NIH]] "has adopted a non-exclusive licensing approach for these patent rights in order to allow multiple [[vaccine]] developers" to make a [[vaccine]].
-   [[NIH]] added that "federal employees listed as inventors on these patent applications assigned their rights to the U.S. [[government]]. Accordingly, should the \[[[United]] [[States]] Patent and Trademark Office\] and other national patent authorities grant the patents, the U.S. [[government]] will hold ownership interest in the patents."
-   [[Moderna]] declined to comment beyond a [statement](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6955095-[[Moderna]]-Statement-to-Axios.html), which said the company "has a broad owned and licensed IP estate" and is "not aware of any IP that would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, including" the [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]].

**Between the lines:** Rizvi said [co-owning](https://crsreports.[[congress]].gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10422) the [[vaccine]] could allow [[NIH]] to more broadly license the underlying technology to other [[vaccine]] manufacturers "without the consent of [[Moderna]]," a company that is valued at $25 billion despite having no federally approved [[drugs]] on the market.

**The bottom line:** Many experts anticipate a [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]], once proven safe and effective, would be made as widely available as possible, and that developers aren't likely to seek big profits from it. Partial federal ownership could be a backstop if those assumptions don't bear out, but [[NIH]] isn't keen on stepping on industry's toes.

-   "Talking to the [[companies]], I don't hear any of them say they think this \[[[vaccine]]\] is a money-maker," Collins said during his Economic Club interview. "I think they want to recoup their costs and maybe make a tiny percentage of increase of profit over that, like single digits percentage-wise, but that's it. Nobody sees this as a way to make billions of dollars."
