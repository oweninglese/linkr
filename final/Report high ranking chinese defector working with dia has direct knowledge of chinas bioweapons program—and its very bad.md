[In an exclusive story](https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2021/06/04/exclusive-high-ranking-chinese-[[defector]]-has-direct-knowledge-of-several-chinese-special-weapons-programs-n391238) at RedState, Jen Van Laar reports that sources inside the intelligence community say a high-ranking [[defector]] from [[China]] has been working for months with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). According to Van Laar’s confidential sources, that high-ranking [[defector]] claims to have knowledge of special weapons programs in [[China]]—that include [[bioweapon]]s.

Adam Housley first reported [via Twitter on Thursday](https://twitter.com/adamhousley/status/140067063[[1562]]076161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E140067063[[1562]]076161%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fredstate.com%2Fjenvanlaar%2F2021%2F06%2F04%2Fexclusive-high-ranking-chinese-[[defector]]-has-direct-knowledge-of-several-chinese-special-weapons-programs-n391238) that “the increased pressure on [[China]] in recent days is due to a [[defector]] with intimate knowledge” of the program. According to Housley, [[FBI]] director Christopher Wray “didn’t know right away because they wanted to make sure they got all they needed before telling him.”

In fact, Wray was “ambushed” with the information, according to Van Laar’s sources, as was the [[CIA]]. “Sources say DIA leadership kept the [[defector]] within their Clandestine Services network to prevent Langley and the State Department from accessing the person, whose existence was kept from other agencies because DIA leadership believes there are [[Chinese]] spies or sources inside the [[FBI]], [[CIA]], and several other federal agencies,” according to the report.

Why was the [[defector]] so important that he had to be kept under wraps?

Housley says it’s because the [[defector]] has information on the origins of the [[Wuhan]] [[virus]]: “[[China]] is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that [[corona[[virus]]]] originally came from a lab.” He later clarified: “US intelligence has a [[Chinese]] [[defector]] with [[Wuhan]] info. AND [[China]] is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that [[corona[[virus]]]] originally came from a lab.”

According to RedState’s sources, “the [[defector]] has been with the DIA for three months” and has provided “an extensive, technically detailed debrief to US officials.”

“In DIA’s assessment, the information provided by the [[defector]] is legitimate,” wrote Van Laar. “Sources say the level of confidence in the [[defector]]’s information is what has led to a sudden crisis of confidence in Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]], adding that [U.S. Army Medical [[Research]] Institute of Infectious [[Disease]]s ([[USA]]MRIID)](https://www.usamriid.army.mil/) personnel detailed to DIA have corroborated very technical details of information provided by the [[defector]].” 

All of this raises many questions. Why, “suddenly,” did the U.S. legacy media en masse turn-tail and start pointing fingers at [[China]] and doubting [[Fauci]]?  Why did left-wing outlets like the _[[Washington]] Post_ and BuzzFeed “suddenly” decide it was the right time to drop [[Fauci]]’s emails—just days after the lab-leak story was “suddenly” no longer verboten on social media? [[Fauci]]’s emails revealed what we’ve been reporting here at PJ Media for months (mostly [behind the paywall for our VIP subscribers](https://pjmedia.com/subscribe) to avoid the Gestapo social-media censors): that [[Fauci]] was working with a [[Chinese]] scientist from the [[Wuhan]] lab; that he asked Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg to help with [[COVID]] messaging; and that he signed off on funding for dangerous gain-of-function research in [[Wuhan]].

One gets the sense that a dam the size of Three Gorges on the Yangtze River is about to blow. The question will be, as it almost is when political figures are caught in a coverup: What did they know and when did they know it? And _who_ knew what was really going on?

If any of this turns out to be true—particularly the suggestion that [[China]] may have intentionally unleashed the most deadly [[bioweapon]] in world [[history]]—you might want to begin thinking about where you’re going to spend the U.S.-Sino [[War]]. If, as Housley claims, the [[FBI]], [[CIA]], and other federal agencies are swarming with [[Chinese]] spies, it would constitute the biggest national security failure in U.S. [[history]]—and the most deadly.

The implications are terrifying.
