[[June]] 7, [[2020]] ([LifeSite[[News]]](https://www.lifesitenews.com/)) — The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reportedly hid the existence of a [[Chinese]] [[defector]] with knowledge of the communist nation’s [[bioweapon]]s program from the [[FBI]] and [[CIA]] because it felt those agencies could not be trusted. 

In a recent series of tweets, independent journalist Adam Housley called attention to the existence of the informant who has told DIA authorities that [[China]] is trying to produce variants of the [[virus]] suggesting that [[COVID]]-19 came from bats in order to cover up that it came from the [[Wuhan]] lab. 

According to a report [by Red State](https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2021/06/04/exclusive-high-ranking-chinese-[[defector]]-has-direct-knowledge-of-several-chinese-special-weapons-programs-n391238), the high-ranking [[defector]] has been with the DIA for three months, providing “an extensive, technically detailed debriefing to US officials.” 

“Sources say the level of confidence in the [[defector]]’s information is what has led to a sudden crisis of confidence in Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]],” asserts the [Red State report](https://redstate.com/jenvanlaar/2021/06/04/exclusive-high-ranking-chinese-[[defector]]-has-direct-knowledge-of-several-chinese-special-weapons-programs-n391238), “adding that U.S. Army Medical [[Research]] Institute of Infectious [[Disease]]s ([[USA]]MRIID) personnel detailed to DIA have corroborated very technical details of information provided by the [[defector]].”

After having canceled the [[Trump]] administration’s investigation into the [[virus]]’ origins, the Biden White House has recently been forced to [hurriedly launch another](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/is-biden-helping-china-cover-up-its-covid-crimes). 

“Being told the increased pressure on [[China]] in recent days is due to a [[defector]] with intimate knowledge,” [tweeted](https://twitter.com/adamhousley/status/1400670397473775617) Housley. “In fact, \[[[FBI]] director Christopher A.\] Wray didn’t know right away because they wanted to make sure they got all they needed before telling him.

“Also … US intelligence believes [[China]] is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that it originally came from a lab,” [continued](https://twitter.com/adamhousley/status/140067063[[1562]]076161) Housley. “The belief is still that it escaped accidentally, but was allowed to spread.”

“Again … what I reported tonight. US intelligence has a [[Chinese]] [[defector]] with [[Wuhan]] info. AND [[China]] is trying to produce variants that suggest it came from bats to cover up that [[corona[[virus]]]] originally came from a lab,” [reiterated](https://twitter.com/adamhousley/status/1400679023668[[1871]]37) Housley.

“[[FBI]] Director Christopher Wray was ‘ambushed’ with the information,” RedState’s sources say. “Langley was also unaware. Sources say DIA leadership kept the [[defector]] within their Clandestine Services network to prevent Langley and the State Department from accessing the person, whose existence was kept from other agencies because DIA leadership believes there are [[Chinese]] spies or sources inside the [[FBI]], [[CIA]], and several other federal agencies.”

In a [commentary](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/is-biden-helping-china-cover-up-its-covid-crimes) written for LifeSite[[News]] late last month, [[China]] expert Steven Mosher indicated why the [[FBI]], [[CIA]], and other U.S. intelligence agencies are untrustworthy: 

> \[T\]hese are the same intelligence agencies that fed us the Steele Dossier and [[Russia]]n Collusion lies of the past few years. I myself have little confidence that these heavily politicized agencies will produce anything other than a [[white]]wash of [[China]]’s responsibility for the [[pandemic]] that it unleashed upon the world. Not to mention that they will be starting from ground-zero in carrying out their investigation.  

Mosher was the first to expose the [[[Wuhan]]-lab origin of the [[corona[[virus]]]]](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/how-[[covid-19]]-may-have-been-deliberately-engineered-in-a-china-biolab), drawing the fury of Silicon Valley “fact-checkers.”  

In a recent [video interview](https://www.lifesitenews.com/blogs/steve-mosher-exposed-the-covid-lab-leak-a-year-ago?utm_source=editor_picks&utm_campaign=standard) with LifeSite’s editor-in-chief John-Henry Westen, Mosher “connected how [[China]]’s People’s Liberation Army was involved in [[[[experiment]]s]] at the [[bioweapon]]s lab [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology that were ‘not just purely scientific research.’ He also highlighted the involvement of Anthony [[Fauci]] in not only covering up this information, but even in helping the [[Wuhan]] lab with funds, training, and support.”  

[[FBI]] Director Christopher Wray’s “blatantly political bent is unprofessional and is undoubtedly sowing distrust within the ranks of the nation’s security agencies,” wrote [Kyle Becker](https://beckernews.com/fbi-ambushed-by-report-of-high-ranking-chinese-[[defector]]-with-knowledge-of-[[bioweapon]]s-programs-39534/), a former writer/associate producer at Fox [[News]] and founder of Becker [[News]].

“Wray’s misleading comments about the threat posed to the nation by ‘[[white]] supremacists’ and ‘far right domestic extremists’ do not comport with present day political realities that grave threats are posed by both the right and the left, including radicalized Black Lives Matter activists and Antifa extremists who have caused billions in damage to communities nationwides \[sic\], as well as hundreds of injuries and dozens of [[death]]s,” said Becker.
