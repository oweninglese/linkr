If you are anything like me, I need multiple lists to keep myself organized this
time of year. With the holidays speeding towards us faster than we can keep up, 
I need a list for tasks to complete at work before we break for the holidays; a 
grocery list to prepare for multiple family feasts; and, of course, the holiday 
gift-giving list. Without these lists, I would certainly be doomed to rely on my
brain, which is already overloaded with the [[2019]] work I have to complete and the
giant to-do list for [[2020]]. I find lists extremely helpful, as they keep me from 
impulse shopping and overspending. I also have another list, which is my giving 
list – a list that reminds me to share my privilege with others. The one thing 
these lists all have in common is that they are all focused on buying native and
giving native all year long.
 
 
Recently, Niigaan Sinclair, the award-winning Anishinabe columnist for the 
[[Winnipeg]] Free Press, wrote an article urging [[[[Manitoba]]]]ns and [[Canadian]]s to buy 
[[Indigenous]].

He argues that it makes more sense to invest in [[Indigenous]] businesses that 
contribute to local economies, rather than the large US-owned box stores where 
billions of dollars flow to US corporate owners. This makes a great deal of 
sense. When you invest in [[First]] Nation businesses for example, you help [[First]] 
Nation economies, which in turn, help regional [[Canadian]] economies through their 
own spending and employment. Niigaan provided a list of various [[Indigenous]] 
businesses that offer everything from food, music and books; to clothing and 
jewellery. Who could ask for a better list of gift-giving options, than this 
list of [[Indigenous]] goods that are handmade and steeped in the rich cultures and 
traditions of local [[First]] [[Nations]]?
 
 
This past summer, Sarain Fox, an Anishinabe television host, actress, model and 
activist shared with the Globe and Mail how she assembles her wardrobe from 
[[Indigenous]]-made products.

-a-wardrobe-of-[[indigenous]]-made-products/[4]
 
 
Sarain has always made lifting up others part of everything she does and giving 
a nod to her curated list of [[Indigenous]] artists and businesses is part of 
helping to promote them. She highlighted some of the [[Indigenous]] clothing, boots 
and purses she wears every day. Her goal is to celebrate [[Indigenous]] peoples 
every day – not just on holidays like [[Indigenous]] Peoples Day. A shout-out from 
someone with Sarain’s public profile helps promote [[Indigenous]] businesses and 
boost the [[Indigenous]] economy referenced by Niigaan. You can also find other 
curated lists of native owned businesses in [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] on websites like 
Beyond Buckskin:

I agree with them both. Buying native helps support local [[First]] Nation and 
[[Canadian]] economies and should be a focus all year round – not just during the 
holidays. I would also add that it is usually this time of year that we see 
public calls to support various groups and causes with donations. The holidays 
evoke in many people a moral obligation and desire to share their good fortune –
big or small – with others to help address urgent individual needs and/or 
advance social justice more broadly. To my mind, this should never be about 
“charity” or holiday-based “good will”; but instead be about fulfilling our 
legal obligations to one another under the various [[treaties]] we signed to share 
the lands, resources and wealth. It is also about real reconciliation, which is 
about more than a celebration of native cultures, but also about individual 
responsibility to address past and ongoing injustices.
 
 
To this end, there are various native groups and organizations to which you 
could direct your giving this holiday and throughout the new year ahead. There 
are small organizations working hard to advocate for the basic human rights of 
[[First]] [[Nations]] [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care or the safety of [[Indigenous]] women and 
girls. Similarly, there are smaller, more informal groups in need of supplies 
and/or legal assistance as they occupy [[First]] Nation territories to protect the 
lands, waters, plants and animals from the devastating environmental destruction
of the extractive industry. In protecting water sources, forests and ecosystems 
from contamination, [[First]] [[Nations]] warriors are protecting the health and 
well-being of both [[Indigenous]] peoples and [[Canadian]]s. We all have [[treaty]] and 
other obligations to contribute in some way to the protection of Turtle Island 
for future generations – and giving to native causes can be part of that.
 
 
There are far too many native businesses and causes to note here, so what 
follows is a list of some of the ways that I buy native and give native all year
round. While some of those on the Buy [[Native]] list are larger businesses, there 
are hundreds of individuals who sell their goods at pow wows and cultural 
events, as well as through social media outlets. I have purchased some of the 
best beaded earrings from artists who I spotted on Instagram. Similarly, while 
larger native organizations on the Give [[Native]] list are easier to find through 
their websites, don’t forget to scan your social media for smaller groups making
call outs for urgently needed donations.
 
 
BUY NATIVE:
 
 
Online: 
 
Cheekbone Beauty was founded by Jennifer Harper and is an [[Indigenous]] owned, 
cruelty free cosmetic company. They offer high quality cosmetics and donate part
of their profits to help fund education for [[Indigenous]] peoples. Their [[War]]rior 
Women line of lipsticks include shades named after native women warriors – like 
Sarain Fox, Cindy Blackstock and me! I bought their most recent holiday 
collection, which includes my shade of lipstick - true warm red!
 
https://cheekbonebeauty.ca/[6]
 
 
She [[Native]] is an [[Indigenous]] owned company that offers leather handbags and 
clothing that share [[Indigenous]] teachings and positive messaging. I have bought 
their t-shirts and hoodies and just love them! I really appreciate the positive 
messaging and celebration of [[Indigenous]] women.
 
https://www.shenative.com/[7]
 
 
Tammy Beauvais Designsis another company that is 100% [[Indigenous]] owned and Tammy
can be seen selling purses, ribbon skirts and native designed clothing for men 
and women all over [[Canada]]. One of my favorite things about pow wows is racing to
find her stall to buy something new. One of my favorites is a beautiful [[white]] 
[[bomb]]er jacket with native-inspired flowers all over it.
 
https://tammybeauvais.com[8]
 
 
Nishiin Designs is a business I just recently found through social media. They 
are an [[Indigenous]] company that offers Anishinabe designed purses, clothing and 
accessories. I saw one of their purses on Instagram, fell in love with it and 
insta-ordered it! 
 
https://www.nishiin.ca/[9]
 
 
Shop in Store:
 
Cedar Basket Gift Shopis located inside the [[Native]] [[Canadian]] Centre in downtown 
[[Toronto]]. They have a huge collection of artwork, crafts, household items, 
jewellery and moccasins handcrafted by [[Indigenous]] peoples. I especially love 
their baskets and beadwork. I have never been able to visit that store and leave
without a gift for someone. 
 
https://ncct.on.ca/gift-shop/[10]
 
 
Teekca’s [[Aboriginal]] Boutiqueis a native-owned store at The Forks in [[Winnipeg]] 
that is well-known for its custom work. I had shirts and blazers specially 
tailored for my son who loves wearing his one-of-a-kind beaded suits to work. 
 
http://www.teekcasboutique.ca/en/home[11]
 
 
Rez Famous is a Mi’kmaw clothing company from back home in the Maritimes. I have
their tees, hoodies, caps and everything I can get my hands on! You can find 
them at pow wows as well as on Facebook.
 
https://www.facebook.com/rezfamousbrand/[12]
 
 
[[War]]rior Life clothing is one of my own latest initiatives to help raise funds to
keep my media completely independent. I use the proceeds to help pay for the 
costs of my Youtube channel, my [[War]]rior Life podcast and my [[Indigenous]] 
Nationhood blog. It will also (hopefully) defray some of the costs for my second
podcast set to be released in the new year.

GIVE NATIVE:
 
 
[[First]] [[Nations]] Child and Family Caring Society, headed by Dr. Cindy Blackstock, 
advocates strenuously for [[First]] [[Nations]] [[child]]ren, youth and families so they can
grow up happy, healthy, safe and proud of who they are as [[First]] [[Nations]]. They 
brought a human rights complaint against [[Canada]] for historic and ongoing racial 
discrimination against [[First]] [[Nations]] [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care – and won. They 
continue their [[battle]] at the Tribunal and in the courts to force [[Canada]] to 
comply with the orders and finally end discrimination. There are so many ways 
you can help them: including “7 Free Ways to Help”; purchasing [[child]]ren’s 
educational books and calendars; and/or making donations.
 
https://fncaringsociety.com/welcome[14]
 
 
Gitdimt'en Yintah Accessis a group of [[First]] Nation peoples from the Wet’suwet’en
Nation from Gitdimt’en clan who are governing their territory and protecting it 
from pipelines. They are true warriors who risk their safety and freedom by 
protecting lands and waters from the devastation of pipelines. They need our 
support in terms of supplies and donations for their legal fees. You can give 
one-time donations or ongoing monthly support.
 
https://www.yintahaccess.com/[15]
 
 
Unist’ot’en Camp is another clan from the Wet’suwet’en Nation governing their 
territory to protect it from pipelines. You can support them through buying 
their merchandise, making a one time donation to their legal fund or offering 
monthly support for supplies for those protecting the lands and waters. 
 
http://unistoten.camp/support-us/donate/[16]
 
 
[[Treaty]] Truckhouse Legal Fundis a group of [[grassroots]] peoples including Mi’kmaw 
[[treaty]] rights holders, grandmothers and local allies who are standing united as 
water protectors of the Shubenacadie River in the Sipekne'katik District of 
Mi'kma'ki. They have been trying to protect the river for years and as a result 
need donations for legal expenses.
 
https://ca.gofundme.com/f/720lt7c[17]
 
 
Tiny House [[War]]riorsis an initiative from the Secwepemc peoples whose mission is 
to: “stop the Trans Mountain pipeline from crossing unceded Secwepemc 
Territory.” The Secwepemc peoples are asserting their law and jurisdiction on 
their territory by building tiny houses all along the pipeline route in order to
block access to this pipeline. Kanahus Manuel is one of the native women 
warriors who has placed her safety and freedom on the line to protect our 
collective futures. You can donate through their official Tiny House [[War]]riors or
Secwepemc Nation Youth Network Go Fund Me pages on their website.

I hope you all have a safe and happy holiday with family and friends and I look 
forward to joining forces with you all in the New Year to advocate for justice 
on Turtle Island.
