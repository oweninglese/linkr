USING [[MESSENGER [[RNA]]]] to make [[[[vaccine]]s]] was an unproven idea. But if it worked, the technique would [[revolution]]ise [[medicine]], not least by providing protection against [[Infectious [[Disease]]s]] and [[[[biological]] weapons]]. So in [[2013]] [[America’s Defence Advanced [[Research]] Projects Agency (DARPA)]] gambled. It awarded a small, new firm called [[[[Moderna]]]] $25m to develop the idea. Eight years, and more than 175m doses later, [[Moderna]]’s [[[[COVID]]-19]] [[vaccine]] sits alongside weather satellites, [[GPS]], [[drones]], [[stealth technology]], [[voice interfaces]], [[the personal [[computer]]]] and the internet on the list of innovations for which [[DARPA]] can claim at least partial credit.

It is the agency that shaped the modern world, and this success has spurred imitators. In America there are ARPAs for homeland security, intelligence and energy, as well as the original defence one. [[[[President]]]] [[Joe Biden]] has asked [[Congress]] for $6.5bn to set up a health version, which will, the president vows, “end cancer as we know it”. His administration also has plans for another, to tackle [[climate]] change. [[Germany]] has recently established two such agencies: one civilian (the [[Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation]], or SPRIN\-D) and another military (the [[Cybersecurity Innovation Agency]]). Japan’s interpretation is called [[Moonshot R&D]]. In [[[[Britain]]]] a bill for an[[ Advanced [[Research]] and Invention Agency]]—often referred to as [UK ARPA](https://www.economist.com/britain/2021/02/04/a-new-[[[[science]]]]-agency-is-part-of-plans-to-transform-research-in-britain)—is making its way through Parliament.

## An agency needs agency

As [[[[government]]s]] across the rich world begin, after a four-decade lull, to spend more on[[research and development]], the idea of an agency to invent the #future (and, in so doing, generate vast industries) is alluring and, the success of #DARPA suggests, no mere fantasy. In many countries there is displeasure with the web of #bureaucracy that entangles #funding #systems, and hope that the DARPA model can provide a way of getting around it. But as some have discovered, and others soon will, copying DARPA requires more than just copying the name. It also needs commitment to the #principles which made the original agency so successful—principles that are often uncomfortable for #politicians.

On paper, the approach is straightforward. Take enormous, reckless gambles on things so beneficial that only a handful need work to make the whole venture a success. As Arun Majumdar, founding director of ARPA\-E, America’s energy agency, puts it: “If every project is succeeding, you’re not trying hard enough.” Current ( #unclassified) DARPA [[projects]] include mimicking #insects’ nervous systems in order to reduce the computation required for [[artificial intelligenc]]e and working out how to #protect #soldiers from the #enemy’s use of #genome-editing #technologies.

The result is a mirror image of normal [[R&D]] agencies. Whereas most focus on basic research, DARPA builds things. Whereas most use peer review and carefully selected measurements of progress, DARPA strips bureaucracy to the bones (the conversation in [[1965]] which led the agency to give out $1m for the first cross-country [[computer]] network, a forerunner to the internet, took just 15 minutes). All work is contracted out. DARPA has a boss, a small number of office directors and fewer than 100 programme managers, hired on fixed short-term contracts, who act in a manner akin to [[venture capitalists]], albeit with the aim of generating specific outcomes rather than private returns.

The first challenge for the new ARPAs is to secure the breathing space required for such [[experiment]]ation. SPRIN\-D illustrates how difficult this can be. The concept was approved by Germany’s cabinet—“and then the Federal Court of Auditors came along,” sighs Barbara Diehl, SPRIN\-D’s chief partnership officer. After the auditors issued their recommendations, the agency lost its exemption from standard public-sector procurement rules and pay scales, restricting who it could hire and the sorts of risks it could take. Existing [[government]] ministries exert in[[flu]]ence through the agency’s board, stymying radicalism, says Ms Diehl. Dominic Cummings, a former aide to [[Boris Johnson]], [[Britain]]’s [[prime minister]], who demanded a [[[[British]]]] agency as a condition of his employment, has said he is concerned by the provisions for ministerial oversight in the legislation creating it.

Without freedom from political interference, the risk-taking instincts of those at the cutting edge are curbed. The administrative and research directors of [[Germany’s Cybersecurity Innovation Agency]] recently quit, frustrated by political interference. In America the homeland-security ARPA was established in [[2002]], but has been hamstrung by power struggles in the department that gave it its name. “It has never been allowed to make independent decisions, it has never been allowed an independent budget,” says an observer. There is a debate about whether the [[Biden administration]]’s health ARPA (ARPA\-H) ought to stand alone, or be part of the [[National Institutes of Health ([[NIH]])]]. The latter would be less of a legislative challenge, but may infringe its #independence.

## Progress report

DARPA’s budget in [[2020]] was $3.6bn, equivalent to just 8% of the [[NIH]]’s. If all goes to plan, ARPA\-H will be on a similar scale, but none of the others receives such funding (ARPA-E got $425m last year, roughly as much as one of DARPA’s six offices). Since the model works by making lots of bets in the hope that a few will come off, stingier funding means fewer wagers, which reduces the chance of success and thus of continued political support. This is especially true given the difficulty of measuring progress. As a paper by Pierre Azoulay of the[[ Massachusetts Institute of [[Technology]] (MIT)]] and his colleagues notes: “It is impossible to accurately measure the incidence of one-in-a-thousand ideas, much less one-in-a-million ideas, on a timescale relevant to political decision-making.”

The new agencies must also work out how to get their innovations out of the lab. There is a close relationship between DARPA and the Department of Defence, which is a customer for its work. But other agencies lack such a pipeline. [[Research]] by Anna Goldstein at the [[University]] of Massachusetts, Amherst, and her colleagues finds that, although new “cleantech” [[companies]] sponsored by ARPA-E produce more patents than others, they are not more likely to raise venture capital, be acquired by larger firms or list on public markets. So far, at least, the agency’s innovations have struggled to leap into the real world.

When ARPA-E began in [[2009]] the hope was that venture capitalists would pick up innovations emerging from it. They have proved reluctant. Energy technologies take far longer to reach the market than venture capital’s favourite investment, software. ARPA-E has thus tweaked the DARPA model to add a “tech-to-market” team, to guide [[projects]] through the industrial [[jungle]]. Last year it began handing out grants to promising previous award-winners seeking to grow. William Bonvillian, a [[[[science]]]]-policy expert at MIT, suspects one [[missing]] ingredient is simply time: “We created the internet in ’69. It didn’t scale up until ’91 or ’92. So we’ve just got to get used to it taking a while.”

ARPA-H may face similar difficulties. It is based on the idea that the [[NIH]] is too conservative, focusing on biology at a time when many life-[[[[science]]]] breakthroughs happen where biology, [[chemistry]] and [[computer]] [[[[science]]]] meet. Mikko Packalen and Jay Bhattacharya, of [[Waterloo]] and [[Stanford]] universities respectively, provide supportive evidence, finding that the [[NIH]]’s funding of work building on new advances has declined. ARPA-H’s other goal, though, is to pump money into [[treatment]]s for rare diseases, eschewed by the private sector because of limited moneymaking opportunities. As with ARPA-E, this lack of commercial interest may make the transition from innovation to the real world tricky.

Michael Stebbins, who was an official in [[Barack Obama]]’s administration, and is an advocate for ARPA-H, hopes that someone from DARPA can be recruited to lead the new agency. Replicating DARPA’s freewheeling culture is such a challenging task that there have been times when DARPA itself has failed. It went through a fallow period in the late [[1960]]s and early [[1970]]s, and many feel its ambitions have been trimmed back in recent decades—minimising failures, but also successes.

The defence focus also has an inbuilt advantage. By failing to build a terrible weapon, [[America]] leaders can reassure themselves that their adversaries won’t either. There is no such reassurance in failing to cure cancer. But that has not been enough to dissuade politicians in [[America]], [[[[Britain]]]], [[Germany]] and [[Japan]]. The lesson many have learnt from [[DARPA]] is that mere difficulty is no reason to avoid something. It may even be a reason to do it. ■
