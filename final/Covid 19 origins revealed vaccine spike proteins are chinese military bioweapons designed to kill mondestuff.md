The cover-up has imploded. #[[Covid]]-19 was #engineered in a #lab, and the desperate attempts to hide its true origins are rapidly collapsing.

Over the weekend, even the [[[[Wall]] [[Street]] [[Journal]]]] is now catching up to what Natural [[News]] reported a year ago, admitting that [[covid-19]] came from a lab. The article is entitled, “[The [[Science]] Suggests a [[Wuhan]] Lab Leak](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-[[science]]-suggests-a-wuhan-lab-leak-11622995184)” and carries the subhead, “The [[Covid]]-19 #pathogen has a genetic footprint that has never been observed in a natural [[corona[[virus]]]].”

Authored by Steven #Quay and Richard #Muller, the article discusses the genetic #fingerprint of the “[[double CGG]]” combination that appears in the [[virus]]:

_Although the double CGG is suppressed naturally, the opposite is true in laboratory work. The insertion sequence of choice is the double [[CGG]]. That’s because it is readily available and convenient, and scientists have a great deal of experience inserting it. An additional advantage of the double CGG sequence compared with the other 35 possible choices: It creates a useful beacon that permits the scientists to track the insertion in the laboratory. Now the damning fact. It was this exact sequence that appears in [[CoV-2]]._

Despite this, the virologists involved in the [[gain-of-function]] research on [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] sought to hide the existence of this double CGG fingerprint:

_When the lab’s [[Shi Zhengli]] and colleagues published a paper in [[[[February]] [[2020]]]] with the [[virus]]’s partial genome, they omitted any mention of the special sequence that supercharges the [[virus]] or the rare [[double CGG]]section. Yet the fingerprint is easily identified in the data that accompanied the paper. Was it omitted in the hope that nobody would notice this evidence of the #gain-of-function origin?_

_But in a matter of weeks #virologists Bruno Coutard and colleagues published their discovery of the sequence in CoV-2 and its novel supercharged site. Double CGG is there; you only have to look. They comment in their paper that the protein that held it “may provide a gain-of-function” capability to the #[[virus]], “for efficient spreading” to humans._

So it’s not just that #SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a lab; the scientists involved in that effort **also tried to cover their tracks and deceive the world as millions [[died]]**.

“The scientific evidence points to the conclusion that the [[virus]] was developed in a laboratory,” write [[Quay]] and [[Muller]]. Yes, we knew that a year ago. Now, the mainstream media is finally beginning to admit to the reality that those of us in the independent media have known all along.

**From the [[UK]] Daily Mail:**

_The [[Pentagon]] gave $39 MILLION to Dr. Peter Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance – the charity that funded [[corona[[virus]]]] research at the [[Wuhan]] lab accused of being the source of the outbreak, federal data reveals… Federal data seen by DailyMail.com reveals The #Pentagon gave $39 million to EcoHealth Alliance, which funded a lab in [[Wuhan]], [[China]], between [[2013]] and [[2020]]. [[The [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology]] is accused of being the source of [[Covid]]-19._

**From LifeSite[[News]]:**

_[[The [[Australia]]n Strategic Policy Institute]] ([[ASPI]]) has just uncovered a [[Chinese]] book that proves that [[Chinese]] military scientists have been working towards the development of a “[[new era of genetic weapons]].” These weapons, the [[Chinese]] scientists promised, could be “artificially manipulated into an emerging human disease [[virus]], then weaponized and unleashed.”_

_In the [[[[2015]]]] volume, called [[The Unnatural Origin of SARS and New Species of Man-Made Viruses as Genetic Bioweapons]], the [[Chinese]] military scientists begin by suggesting that World [[War]] III would be fought with [[biological]] weapons._

_And not just any [[bioweapon]]s._

_#Corona[[virus]]es, a number of which cause #respiratory illnesses in people, were mentioned as a class of #[[virus]]es that could be readily weaponized. Indeed, the #[[Chinese]] scientists were even more explicit, pointing out in their paper that the [[corona[[virus]]]] that causes [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]], or #SARS, was an ideal candidate for a [[bioweapon]]._

**From The Bulletin:**

_It later turned out that the #Lancet letter had been organized and drafted by Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York. Daszak’s organization funded [[corona[[virus]]]] research at the [[[[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology]]. If the [[SARS2]] [[virus]] had indeed escaped from research he funded, Daszak would be potentially culpable. This acute conflict of interest was not declared to the Lancet’s readers. To the contrary, the letter concluded, “We declare no competing interests.”_

_ #Virologists like Daszak had much at stake in the assigning of blame for the [[pandemic]]. For 20 years, mostly beneath the public’s attention, they had been playing a dangerous game. In their laboratories they routinely created [[virus]]es more dangerous than those that exist in nature. They argued that they could do so safely, and that by getting ahead of nature they could predict and prevent natural “ #spillovers…”_

_[[Research]]ers at the [[[[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology]], led by [[[[China]]]]’s leading expert on #bat [[virus]]es, [[Shi Zheng-li]] or “Bat Lady,” mounted frequent expeditions to the #bat-infested caves of [[Yunnan]] in southern #[[China]] and collected around a hundred different bat #[[corona[[virus]]]]es._

_Shi then teamed up with Ralph S. Baric, an eminent [[corona[[virus]]]] #researcher at the [[University]] of North Carolina. Their work focused on enhancing the ability of bat #[[virus]]es to attack humans so as to “examine the emergence potential (that is, the potential to infect humans) of circulating bat CoVs \[[[corona[[virus]]]]es\].” In pursuit of this aim, in [[[[November]] [[2015]]]] they created a [[novel [[virus]]]] by taking the backbone of the [[SARS1]] [[virus]] and replacing its [[spike protein]] with one from a bat [[virus]] (known as [[SHC014-CoV]]). This manufactured [[virus]] was able to infect the cells of the human airway, at least when tested against a lab culture of such cells._

_Baric had developed, and taught Shi, a general method for engineering bat [[corona[[virus]]]]es to attack other species. The specific targets were human cells grown in cultures and humanized mice._

## [[Peter Daszak]] celebrates (brags) about engineering the SARS [[corona[[virus]]]] to attack human cells

Also from [[TheBulletin.org]]:

_Shi set out to create #novel #[[corona[[virus]]]]es with the highest possible #infectivity for human cells. Her plan was to take genes that coded for spike proteins possessing a variety of measured affinities for human cells, ranging from high to low. She would insert these spike genes one by one into the backbone of a number of viral genomes (“[[reverse genetics]]” and “[[infectious clone technology]]”), creating a series of chimeric [[virus]]es. These chimeric [[virus]]es would then be tested for their ability to attack human cell cultures (“in vitro”) and humanized mice (“in vivo”)._

_On [[December]] 9, [[2019]], before the outbreak of the [[pandemic]] became generally known, Daszak gave an interview in which he talked in glowing terms of how researchers at the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology had been reprogramming the spike protein and generating chimeric [[corona[[virus]]]]es capable of infecting humanized mice._

_“And we have now found, you know, after 6 or 7 years of doing this, over 100 new SARS-related [[corona[[virus]]]]es, very close to SARS,” Daszak says around minute 28 of the interview. “Some of them get into human cells in the lab, some of them can cause SARS disease in humanized mice models and are untreatable with therapeutic monoclonals and you can’t vaccinate against them with a [[vaccine]]. So, these are a clear and present danger…._

_“Daszak: Well I think…[[corona[[virus]]]]es?—?you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily. Spike protein drives a lot of what happen with [[corona[[virus]]]], in zoonotic risk. So you can get the sequence, you can build the protein, and we work a lot with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this. Insert into the backbone of another [[virus]] and do some work in the lab._

_In disjointed style, Daszak is referring to the fact that once you have generated a novel [[corona[[virus]]]] that can attack human cells, you can take the spike protein and make it the basis for a [[vaccine]]._

## Full details in today’s length Situation Update podcast

Today’s podcast provides the full details, covering the origins of covid, the cover-up attempt and the collapse of the cover-up. Now we know that **the spike protein used in covid [[vaccine]]s is actually a communist [[Chinese]] military [[bioweapon]]**.

We also therefore know that [[covid-19]] [[vaccine]]s are [[biological]] weapons designed to exterminate humanity, since they contain the weaponized spike protein that was specifically engineered to attack human ACE2 receptors, which exist all over the body (not just the lungs).

Remember, [[Fauci]] and Daszak helped fund the development of genetically engineered “humanized mice” — mice with human lung tissue — in order to maximize the ability of the [[virus]] to infect human beings. This is all now admitted.
