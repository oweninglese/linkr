RACISM IN BC HEALTHCARE
-----------------------
 
Imagineliving in a country, where hospitals refused to treat you for a stroke, 
because the doctors and nurses assumed you were drunk? Imagine further, that the
emergency room doctor refused to treat your young [[child]] for epilepsy, because 
they assumed she was on [[drugs]]? Well folks, that country is [[Canada]].
 
It doesn’t sound like the [[Canada]] you know. It doesn’t seem to reflect [[Canada]]’s 
world-renowned medical experts and hospitals. Nor does it seem to jive with 
[[Canada]]’s impressive array of human rights protections. Yet, if you are 
[[Indigenous]] in [[Canada]], you can expect this kind of [[treatment]] and worse - even in 
[[Canada]]’s best hospitals in [[British]] Columbia (BC).

Just before the holidays, a report was released which confirmed what most 
[[Indigenous]] peoples already knew – that [[racism]] against [[Indigenous]] peoples, 
especially [[First]] [[Nations]] peoples - is widespread in BC’s healthcare system.
 
IN PLAIN SIGHT
 
The report entitled - In Plain Sight: Addressing [[Indigenous]]-specific [[Racism]] and 
Discrimination in B.C. Health Care - was written by Dr. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond
who was the first, [[First]] [[Nations]] judge appointed to the Provincial Court of 
[[Saskatchewan]]; was the former Child and Youth Advocate in BC; and now the 
independent investigator for this report.
 
She had been appointed by BC’s Minister of Health to conduct a review of [[racism]] 
against [[Indigenous]] peoples in BC’s healthcare system. Dr. Turpel-Lafond and her 
[[Indigenous]]-led team engaged in four months of investigations, which included:
 
- talking to 9,000 people from BC;
 
- reviewing 185,000 data sets including more than 900 studies; and
 
- logging 600 cases via their 1-800 number and website.
 
The report – which includes both its core findings and recommendations - 
contains numerous examples of [[Indigenous]] peoples given substandard medical 
[[treatment]] or no [[treatment]] at all in hospitals and healthcare facilities of all 
kinds. In some cases, individuals were treated so poorly, that they refused to 
go back for [[treatment]] and this was especially true for [[Indigenous]] women.

FINDINGS
 
There were 11 main findings divided into (a) the problem of [[Indigenous]]-specific 
[[racism]] and (b) the problem with current solutions – both of which provide 
significant insight into the lack of accountability for [[racism]] and the harm it 
causes [[Indigenous]] peoples in BC’s healthcare systems.
 
Her main findings in relation to anti-[[Indigenous]] [[racism]] were as follows:
 
(1) Widespread [[Indigenous]]-specific stereotyping, [[racism]] and discrimination exist
in the BC healthcare system;
 
(2) [[Racism]] limits access to medical [[treatment]] and negatively affects the health 
and wellness of [[Indigenous]] peoples in BC;
 
(3) [[Indigenous]] women and girls are disproportionately impacted by 
[[Indigenous]]-specific [[racism]] in the healthcare system;
 
(4) Current public health emergencies magnify [[racism]] and vulnerabilities, and 
disproportionately impact [[Indigenous]] peoples and
 
(5) [[Indigenous]] health care workers face [[racism]] and discrimination in their work 
environments.
 
She also noted that talking about anti-[[Indigenous]] [[racism]] in healthcare can be 
very triggering for [[Indigenous]] peoples who have experienced the physical and 
mental harms associated with racist comments, substandard [[treatment]] or the 
denial of [[treatment]]. At the same time, she also stressed that the issue must be 
named, so that institutions can be held to account and the problems addressed.

STEREOTYPES
 
Dr. Turpel-Lafond shared the eight most common racist stereotypes held by BC 
healthcare workers about [[Indigenous]] peoples (primarily [[First]] [[Nations]], and 
include that belief that they are:
 
(1) Less worthy of care;
 
(2) Drinkers/alchoholics;
 
(3) Drug-seekers;
 
(4) Bad [[parents]];
 
(5) Frequent flyers – misuse health system;
 
(6) Irresponsible & wont do aftercare;
 
(7) Less capable; and
 
(8) Unfairly advantaged.
 
RACISM CAUSES REAL HARM
 
She also stressed that these racist stereotypes lead to real physical harm, 
mental harm and even [[death]] for [[Indigenous]] peoples, in the following ways:
 
(1) Unacceptable personal interactions - like racist comments;
 
(2) Long wait times/denial of service – more so than non-[[Indigenous]] patients;
 
(3) Lack of communication/shunning [[Indigenous]] patients;
 
(4) Not believing or minimizing health concerns – [[Indigenous]] peoples accused of 
faking;
 
(5) Inappropriate or no pain management – assuming patients are drug seeking;
 
(6) Rough [[treatment]] – like man-handling or physical harm;
 
(7) Medical mistakes & misdiagnosis – assuming patients drunk and not addressing
underlying health issues; and
 
(8) Lack of respect for cultural protocols – intolerance of families or 
ceremonies.
 
The significant harms experienced by [[Indigenous]] peoples on a regular basis are 
why the report's recommendations on how to move forward to address 
anti-[[Indigenous]] [[racism]] in BC’s healthcare system are so important. At their 
core, the recommendations all work to confronting the legacy of [[colonialism]] in 
healthcare head on:
 
"A basic awareness has grown that the current inequities and injustices faced by
[[Indigenous]] peoples in [[Canada]] – such as those examined in this Review – are 
deeply rooted in an enduring legacy of [[colonialism]], and that confronting that 
legacy requires substantive, transformative change."
 
MOVING FORWARD
 
It is important that [[Canadian]]s read this report and then push [[government]]s, 
hospitals, universities and all those working in the healthcare system, in any 
capacity to embrace their role in reconciliation and ensuring that the human 
rights of [[Indigenous]] peoples to healthcare are respected, protected and fully 
implemented. To do this, Dr. Turpel-Lafond believes that our collective path 
forward must be based on acknowledging and accepting three foundational 
principles:
 
(1) [[Racism]] in healthcare reflects a lack of respect for [[Indigenous]] rights to 
health;
 
(2) [[Racism]] in the healthcare system is integrated with [[racism]] in society; and
 
(3) While [[Indigenous]] voices must be centered in developing solutions, the 
responsibility to do this work rests with non-[[Indigenous]] people, communities, 
organizations and [[government]]s.
 
Before anyone breathes a sigh of relief that this is only a BC issue – it isn’t.
Anti-[[Indigenous]] [[racism]] in healthcare is rampant in other provinces as well. It 
was only weeks ago, that [[Quebec]] came under fire when a video showed nurses 
saying racist and hateful comments to Joyce Echaquan before she [[died]] in the 
hospital. This was not an isolated incident but reflects a long-standing pattern
of [[racism]] experience by [[Indigenous]] peoples in [[Quebec]] hospitals.

Don’t forget the Brian Sinclair inquiry in [[[[Manitoba]]]], which documented how the 
hospital staff ignored Brian – a double amputee confined to a wheel chair - for 
34 hours until he subsequently [[died]] of a treatable urinary tract infection. And 
sadly, these are not exceptional cases. From the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] 
Peoples in [[1996]] to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report in [[2015]] and 
the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered [[Indigenous]] Women and Girls report
in [[2019]] – [[racism]] in healthcare is a national crisis and has been for decades. 
 
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT
 
[[Racism]] in healthcare is a matter of life and [[death]] for [[Indigenous]] peoples and 
forms part of the ongoing genocide that the National Inquiry talked about in 
their report.
 
It was important for the BC [[government]] to undertake this investigation and 
accept the findings. Every other province and territory should follow suit and 
conduct a similar investigation. While it is important that BC's Minister of 
Health Adrian Dix apologized and committed to take action - it is yet to be seen
whether they will take the action needed to hold themselves accountable, make 
the required changes and make [[reparations]] to [[Indigenous]] peoples. Given the many 
reports sitting on [[government]] shelves gathering dust – it is incumbent on 
[[Canadian]]s to do their part to ensure [[government]]s are held to account.
 
Healthcare is a basic human right and we are all served when we take steps to 
make sure that all peoples – including [[Indigenous]] peoples – can enjoy that 
right.
