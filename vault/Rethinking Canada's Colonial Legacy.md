Abstract in English
The authors interrogate the geo-political power negotiations that
contributed to the ideological construction of [[Canada]] as a nation. This
article focuses especially on the connection with the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an
colonial projects in the [[America]]s initiated over 500 years ago, along the lines
of Latin [[America]]n decolonial thinkers. The myth of [[Canada]] as a benign,
welcoming, generous, peace-keeping, multicultural nation and society is
unsanitized and dismantled. [[Canada]]’s [[history]] is resituated in relation to
the ideological organization of the world according to racialized, classist,
and cultural Eurocentric colonial indicators, which have contributed to
the historical realities of impoverishment, violent exploitation, racialized
discrimination, and cultural genocide throughout the [[America]]s.
Key words: Decolonizing, [[Canada]], Multiculturalism, Decolonial Thinking,

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

Present global migration crises, the volatile international
environment of war and terrorism, growing tides of uninformed
islamophobia, and the retrenchment of nationalist attitudes in
the Global [[North]] signal a change in the seas in the ways peoples from diverse cultural and religious backgrounds relate to
each other. Many in what is now [[Canada]] look to our neighbour
south of the border and celebrate that the [[Canadian]] social
context is not as politically or ethnoracially charged. Others
contrast the [[history]] of Jim Crow law and segregation in the
[[U.S.A.]] with the Multicultural Act, proudly and self-righteously
claiming [[Canada]]’s attempt to incorporate ethnoracial cultural
diversity as part of the nation’s identity and imaginary.
It is our argument, however, that [[Canada]]’s ability to build
a more inclusive society will depend on its capacity to accept
responsibility for the ways in which [[racism]], xenophobia, and
ethnocultural intolerance have shaped the national imaginary.
We draw from the wisdom of decolonial scholars in the Global
[[South]],1 particularly from Latin [[America]], in order to interrogate
how racialization continues to shape the way current social,
cultural, political, and religious structures privilege the Euro
Anglo sectors of [[Canadian]] society. Their work unmasks the
fact that the colonial imperial projects initiated by [[Western]]
[[Europe]]ans some five hundred years ago are responsible for the
historical realities of impoverishment, violent exploitation,
racialized discrimination, and cultural genocide throughout
the [[America]]s. [[Indigenous]] scholars in what is now [[Canada]] have
also confronted ideologies of [[multiculturalism]], for example,
because of [[Canada]]’s failure to recognize the long-standing

It is important to note that many decolonial scholars are Latin [[America]]ns
who reside and work in the [[U.S.A.]] but who emphasize that their place of
enunciation is Latin [[America]]. It is also important to note that decolonial
theoretical currents are part of a long-standing line of critical theoretical
articulations in Latin [[America]] which include critiques to notions of develop[[mental]]ism, dependency theoretical frames, and [[liberation]] discourses.

[[history]] of [[colonialism]] which goes back five hundred years.
Their work has already made significant contributions to
exposing [[Canada]]’s racialized [[history]] of discrimination against
[[Indigenous]] communities. Our approach is to also highlight
how the [[Europe]]an project of imperial expansion and [[colonialism]] has had direct implications for many of the communities
that have made [[Canada]] their home since contact. Our intention here is to build on existing critical work by exa[[mining]]
this [[history]] through the lens of this larger colonial project. We
also acknowledge that [[Canada]]’s role as colonial power is complicated by the dual character of its colonial status; both as
a colonial power, an extension of [[Europe]], and as a colonized
nation, an object of [[Europe]]an and [[U.S.A.]] colonial desire.
At the outset, we argue that the complex and multiply
diverse ethnoracial and cultural contexts of [[Canada]] do not easily fit into the paradigms of postcolonial scholars, but are better
suited to decolonial frameworks. Let us consider why. Both
intellectual currents display orientations which emphasize and
discuss different locations, periodization, mechanisms, and
expressions of colonial power. With few exceptions, postcolonial thinkers focus geographically on Asia as the object of
the colonial imperial gaze and activity.2 In contrast, decolonial
scholars focus on the [[America]]s as the location for the colonial
expressions with which they engage. Postcolonial scholars take
the Enlightenment as the point of reference for analyzing both
“modernity” and colonization, whereas decolonial thinkers
trace modernity and the emergence of [[colonialism]] as far back
as [[1492]]. In other words, there is a difference of periodization.

Fernando Coronil is a good example of a postcolonial thinker whose work
focuses on Latin [[America]], specifically Venezuela. Similarly, Latina/o theologian [[May]]ra Rivera uses postcolonial theory and continental philosophy
to engage her Latina/o context. Others who have engaged postcolonial
scholarship, especially in the theological realm, are really reconfiguring [[liberation]] philosophy and [[theology]]. See (Rivera, [[2007]]) and (Coronil, [[2004]]).

Methodologically speaking, postcolonial scholars focus their
attention on the colonial gaze; it is the colonial subject that
figures prominently in their writings. Meanwhile, decolonial
thinkers look to those outside of the colonial centres of power.
It is the colonized, the others of [[empire]], that receive greater
attention. In other words, there is a difference of orientation
and directionality in each current. Similarly, postcolonial scholars, with notable exceptions, focus particularly on issues of
representation and the imposition of [[Western]] imperial epistemologies. They draw from [[Europe]]an post-structuralist thinkers,
remaining circumscribed by the very [[Europe]]an intellectual
frames which they critique.3 In contrast, decolonial scholars
aim at reclaiming the epistemic traditions of the colonized (See:
Mignolo, [[2009]]). They undertake a rejection of epistemic traditions rather than an interrogation of the epistemologies of the
centre.4 Finally, and more funda[[mental]]ly, postcolonial scholars
zero-in on coloniality as encompassing cultural imperialism,
while decolonial scholars emphasize coloniality as a force leading to: the violent genocidal eradication of the peoples and their
cultures; the enslavement of entire communities; and enormous
people movements (migration) as mechanisms for colonization
(Quijano, [[2000]]). Decolonial scholars also consider that coloniality is part and parcel of the present multiple globalizing
forms of capitalism. Coloniality is then manifested not only as
an imposed cultural force, but as encompassing all aspects of
human existence for all those involved; it embodies a coloniality of power (Quijano, [[2000]]) and imposes a critical apparatus
within which the [[Europe]]an intellectual tradition is celebrated

For example, it is commonly known that postcolonial scholars draw from the
work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan, among others.

We are well aware of the Eurocentric character of the language of epistemologies. Among many decolonial scholars, there is a privileging of the notion of
saberes which incorporates a wide range of approaches by which peoples construct knowledge that includes their wisdom traditions. See (Walsh, [[2007]]).

as the highest expression of human advance/achievement and
patterns of behaviour. These differences put on display a rich
conversation between these two currents that needs to be had
in greater detail at another time. But by contrasting postcolonial and decolonial thinking, and while recognizing their crucial
points of intersection, we have begun to show how decolonial
thinking is more appropriate for our purposes.
[[Indigenous]] intellectuals, scholars, artists, and activists in
what is now [[Canada]] have already made enormous contributions
to these debates.5 We are also well aware that there are many
initiatives, movements, and projects in [[Canada]] and elsewhere
that are not self-perceived as “decolonial” or self-described with
decolonial language along the lines of Latin [[America]]n decolonial
thinking, but which follow in the spirit of this thematic direction.
In what follows, then, it is our intention to complement these
perspectives by showing how decolonial thinking can bring crucial insights to the context of [[Canada]]. In [[alliance]] with [[Indigenous]]
scholars and others, we begin by affirming that the construction
of [[Canada]] as a nation is directly related to the events that began
in [[1492]]. The ways in which colonial forces engaged [[Indigenous]]
communities encompassed: strategic attempts to dislocate them
from their lands, orchestrated moves toward their eradication
by way of military force (genocide), and organized attempts to
destroy their cultures and religious traditions (culturecide, e.g.
residential schools). The [[history]] of the First Nations, Métis, and
Inuit peoples is violently inscribed in [[Canada]]’s invader-settler
[[history]]. Secondly, [[colonialism]] in [[Canada]] introduced complex
power-plays beyond the moment of first contact, including in historical conflicts between English- and [[French]]-speaking sectors of
the country as well as in subsequent waves of immigration, the
effects of which we continue to feel even today. In other words,
the construction of [[Canada]] as a nation is intrinsically connected to

the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an colonial project in the [[America]]s; [[Canada]]’s
[[history]] and formation as a nation, in order to be understood
properly, needs to be resituated within this [[America]]n continental
experience of [[colonialism]]. In the context of [[Canada]], [[colonialism]]
meant the domination of the colonized “other.” On one hand,
[[Canada]] needs to come to terms with the very structures of colonization which continue to disproportionately benefit specific
sectors of the Euro-[[Canadian]] population. On the other hand,
[[Canada]] will also have to confront its multicultural façade which
claims that official [[multiculturalism]] celebrates diversity without
prejudice when in fact it actually excludes those who do not fit
the dominant/normative Euro-[[Canadian]] frame.
Our work comes out of our experiences as a Latino-[[Canadian]]
immigrant and a [[white]] [[Canadian]] settler. Our identities
embody the complex strands of interwoven stories in relation
to these histories and experiences of coloniality. Between us
and in different yet interconnected ways we have experienced:
the pervasiveness of [[colonialism]] in political, social and racialized realities; the destructive effects of [[colonialism]] as part of
the long-standing [[history]] of the construction of [[Canada]] as a
nation; and the hope of working across difference to build relationship and community. We have engaged these issues in the
academy, in the churches, in various community settings, and
in a variety of artistic collaborations. It thus rises out of our
communities of engagement and reflects the ongoing conversation between us about these issues.

(Re) Situating [[Canada]] in the Context
of (Global) Coloniality (and the
Modern-Colonial World System)
[[Canada]]’s inability to deal with diverse cultural groups is
certainly not new. There is a long-standing [[history]] of racialized
and xenophobic attitudes in [[Canada]]. Such racialized attitudes, however, are part of a larger complex of international

and geopolitical colonializing power relations. To be able to
understand present racialized configurations and their concrete structures and expressions in [[Canada]], it is necessary to
situate them within the context of the global colonial project.
Such a move requires an unmasking of the geo-political power
negotiations that have contributed both to the construction
of the [[Canadian]] nation-state and the historical imaginary of
[[Canada]]. These constructions have by-and-large contributed to
the myth of [[Canada]] as a benign, welcoming, generous, peacekeeping, multicultural nation, almost a utopic example for the
rest of the world to look towards. At the same time, [[Canada]]
has functioned and has seen itself, in many ways, as an extension of [[Europe]], as part of the [[British]] Empire. On both counts,
[[Canada]] has succeeded in postponing having to deal with its
own racist [[history]], and, as a result, [[Canadian]]s have not had to
deal substantively with the underside of their colonial past.6
On the flip side, [[Canada]]’s trajectory as a nation may also be
clearly understood as one of the locations for the realization of
the colonial project. It is an object of colonial desire—its land
to be extracted and settled and its peoples to be invaded and
[[conquer]]ed as part of the story of the “discovery” and [[conquer]]ing of the [[America]]s (Medina, [[2017]]).
Latin [[America]]n decolonial scholars describe the conceptual framework that subsumes the co-constitutive axes
of [[colonialism]], modernity and capitalism as coloniality.
They understand “coloniality,” including the modern/
colonial capitalist world-system, as the systemic residue of

One exceptional case which has taken centre stage recently is the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) process in relation to residential
schools for [[Indigenous]] peoples in [[Canada]]. It remains to be seen, however,
how many of the recommendations from the TRC will be implemented.
Furthermore, the TRC and the processes that led up to it have not led to
the recognition of the broader [[history]] of exercising colonial power over
other ethnocultural groups.

[[colonialism]] and its ongoing manifestation in present globalizing, neoliberal systems. 7 Decolonial scholars, along
with some cultural theorists and anthropologists, insist
that “modern” [[history]], and especially the “success” and
“superiority” of [[Europe]]an culture/modernity, can only be
understood if the conquest of the [[America]]s, [[plantation]]
[[slavery]] and the emergence of globalizing forms of capitalism are understood as co-constitutive. 8 In addition, they
argue that the claim of modernity’s success and the selfproclaimed superiority of [[Europe]] must be interrogated
from the perspective of the peoples upon whom modernity was built and [[Europe]]an “civilization” was imposed,
in other words, from the perspective of the vanquished
(Dussel, [[1995]]).

Nelson Maldonado-Torres distinguishes between [[colonialism]] and coloniality, asserting that “[[colonialism]] denotes a political and economic relation in
which the [[sovereignty]] of a nation or a people rests on the power of another
nation, which makes such nation an [[empire]]. Coloniality, instead, refers to
long-standing patterns of power that emerged as a result of [[colonialism]],
but that define culture, labor, intersubjective relations, and knowledge production well beyond the strict limits of colonial administrations” (Nelson
Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]], 70, 242).

Decolonial scholars use Immanuel Wallerstein’s notion of the modern
world-system, expanding it to include the reality of coloniality, thus “the
modern-colonial world-system.” (Mignolo, [[2000]], 18). Decolonial perspectives also put forth similar arguments to those by cultural theorists like
scholars Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, but they differ radically in their focus.
Paul Gilroy, for instance, in The Black [[Atlantic]], argues that Anglo Euro-[[North]]
[[America]]n modernity and its capitalist systems and exploits cannot be
accurately considered without acknowledging the essential centrality and
barbarity of [[plantation]] [[slavery]] in modernity’s inception and fabric. (Gilroy,
[[1993]]) and (Hall, [[2000]], 184–227). By contrast, decolonial scholars emphasize the [[Indigenous]] underside of [[Western]] [[Europe]]an “modernity” and
underscore more broadly the colonial foundation and character of [[Western]]
[[Europe]]an epistemologies. (See Dussel, [[1995]]).

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

We argue that [[Canada]], as a settler [[colony]]/nation which
emerged from the [[British]] and [[French]] invasions of the region,
is a product of this modern-colonial world-system. Despite this
reality, [[Canada]] remains largely outside theoretical post/decolonial discourses; the issues, concerns and social implications
are still largely unengaged. The result has often been to view
[[Canada]] as not having any negative colonial [[history]], while [[Canada]]
itself continues to perpetuate an ongoing “denial and marginalization of [[Native]] people’s experience of [[colonialism]] as well
as of the invader-settler and immigrant experiences” (Brydon,
[[2004]], 173). Indeed, cultural realities in a [[Canadian]] context are
extremely complex, contested and [[flu]]id, shaped by a wide range
of dynamic, shifting and multiple identities often within the
same person or community. The resulting complexity is that
the “inherited identities as First Nations, Métis, [[Québec]]ois,
invader-settler, immigrant, or ‘ethnic’” are intricately interwoven with the reality of coloniality (Brydon, [[2004]], 171).
Yet even these categories are problematic because they
are framed within the colonial understanding of identities as
finished products, which tends to undermine the complex processes involved in the historical encounters of peoples. Identity
categories themselves function as mechanisms for population
control, aimed at keeping people within their identity silos,
which are organized hierarchically. Those people that stand
in-between ethnocultural traditions, because of pervasive
dominant colonial identity frameworks, are often forced to
deny the [[flu]]id and ambivalent ways in which they understand
themselves in public sphere. In the private sphere, however,
they continue to carve and negotiate creative, celebratory, and
often subversive social spaces which spill out into the public
sphere as well (Medina, [[2013]]).
Notions of national identity are no less contested, particularly in the context of [[Canada]] and its connections to the
[[Western]] [[Europe]]an colonial project. In the [[Canadian]] context,
the dominant imaginary denies [[Canada]]’s complicity with

the colonial project. In fact, there is a long-standing [[history]]
of complicity with [[colonialism]] by which [[Canada]] proudly
imagines itself as an extension of [[Europe]]. [[Canada]]’s social,
political and international imaginary exhibits a pride about
its connection to this colonial legacy. The colonial umbilical
cord with [[Europe]] has not been severed. At the same time,
there is a sophisticated ideological apparatus at play, by
which [[Canada]] intentionally conceals its own colonial complicity through the creation of national myths.
The preeminent myth that both perpetuates and hides
[[Canada]]’s colonial legacy is the idea of [[multiculturalism]], as
a utopic society and nation, in which the diversity of ethnocultural identities is celebrated. Scholars range in the ways
they understand-engage [[Canada]]’s policy of [[multiculturalism]].
For example, Charles Taylor critiques the universal application of the idea of “human dignity” along with the idea of the
universal worth of cultural traditions in [[multiculturalism]]. He
claims that behind the affirmation of the universal worth of
cultural groups is their homogenization under [[North]] [[Atlantic]]
criteria (Taylor, [[1992]], 71). In contrast, Himani Bannerji critiques the ideal of [[multiculturalism]] because it perpetuates the
power differential between the official Euro-[[Canadian]] cultures
and everyone else. As she puts it, [[multiculturalism]] advocating
for “minorities” actually (re)inscribes their minoritized status (Bannerji, [[2000]]). From an [[Indigenous]] perspective, Glen
Coulthard critiques the very idea of recognition politics as the
basis for a transformation of the “colonial relationship between
[[Indigenous]] people and the [[Canadian]] nation state.” He writes
that “instead of ushering in an era of peaceful coexistence
grounded on the ideal of reciprocity or mutual recognition, the
politics of recognition in its contemporary liberal form promises to reproduce the very configurations of colonialist, racist,
patriarchal state power that [[Indigenous]] peoples’ demands for
recognition have historically sought to transcend (Coulthard,
2[[014]], 3). Other scholars also highlight the character of

[[multiculturalism]] as a tool to manage the population and structure [[Canadian]] society.9
By perpetuating the myth of [[multiculturalism]] and its attending politics of recognition, attempts at unmasking ongoing
realities of [[racism]], xenophobia, and [[white]] supremacy are seen
as social maladies which [[Canadian]]s have already overcome.
As a result, people who raise concerns about these realities
are stigmatized as disgruntled and are accused of unearthing
issues that are part of a time long gone. Multiculturalism, then,
functions as the governing social imaginary which promotes
the idea that it is possible to construct a society where ethnocultural differences are welcome as long as minoritized people
learn to function within the scope of the dominant “[[white]]”
Euro [[Canadian]] (English- and [[French]]-speaking) culture(s),
including [[Indigenous]] peoples and all other “others.” Whiteness
remains the ubiquitous feature, framework, and point of
reference—though it is absent from the official rhetoric—and is
“synthesized into a national we,” which decides “on the terms of
[[multiculturalism]] and the degree to which multicultural others
should be tolerated or accommodated. This ‘we’ is an essentialized version of a colonial [[Europe]]an turned into [[Canadian]] and
the subject or the agent of [[Canadian]] nationalism” (Bannerji,
[[2000]], 42–43). The implication is that coloniality is constitutive of [[Canada]] as a nation. Admittedly, [[Canada]] as a nation has
made some strides towards becoming a more hospitable nation
to [[Indigenous]] communities and diverse ethnocultural communities, including immigrants. Those changes, however, are not
the result of a commitment to the inclusion of different peoples and cultures in the very fabric of [[Canadian]] culture, [[history]],
and imaginary. Rather, they have taken place because of the
struggles of [[Indigenous]] peoples and other ethnocultural communities against the pervasive structures of discrimination.

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

Unsanitizing [[Canada]]’s Legacy
Re-situating [[Canada]], along the lines of Latin [[America]]n decolonial thinkers, within the broader colonial legacy affirms the
fact that the [[British]] colonial impetus, English coloniality, is at
the heart of the formation of [[Canada]] as a nation. The construction of a positive self-understanding of [[Canada]] as proudly part of
the [[British]] Empire, part of the [[British]] colonial commonwealth, is
unmasked. Reestablishing [[Canada]]’s long [[history]] of colonial connections names the multiplicity of issues that come with its birth
as a nation-state. It is rooted in the initial encounters with originary peoples in the [[America]]s, post [[1492]], which became violent
and resulted in the decimation of the [[Indigenous]] peoples, cultures, and traditions. Though first established as an outpost of
colonial [[empire]], [[Canada]] was subsequently built and continues to
be built by diverse and complex waves of immigration. These waves
which continue even today have significantly impacted the ongoing
formation of the country. However, along with the attempted erasure of the narratives of [[Indigenous]] peoples, the contributions of
many of these groups remain absent from the dominant narrative
of the nation building [[history]]. The retrieval of the multiple stories
of the various waves of immigrants helps us see that [[Canada]] was
not built by “[[white]]s” alone. It was and continues to be built on
the backs of the “others” of the colonial project. Recognizing
[[Canada]]’s multiple histories unhinges the [[Canadian]] story from
the monocultural narrative of [[empire]].
[[Canada]] as a nation did not really begin in [[1867]] with the
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act. Rather, [[Canada]] is the result of
long standing processes of colonization that date as far back
as the arrival of the [[French]] and the [[British]] to the region and
are connected to the larger [[Western]] [[Europe]]an imperial projects initiated by the [[Spanish]] and Portuguese from [[1492]] on.
Like the [[Spanish]] and Portuguese, although with marked differences, the [[French]] and the [[British]] imposed their ideas of
civilization and cultural superiority upon [[Indigenous]] peoples.

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

On one hand, the [[Spanish]] and Portuguese used military
[[violence]] as strategies to annihilate and to displace [[Indigenous]]
peoples from their lands and to subdue [[Indigenous]] resistance.
On the other, the [[French]] and [[British]] began by negotiating
(though not without some acts of [[violence]]) and gradually
turned to systematic methods of cultural subjugation, including but not limited to the violation of [[treaty]] agreements and
the residential school system. The relationship that the [[French]]
and [[British]] sought at first with [[Indigenous]] peoples was circumscribed by colonial structures. It was an uneven relationship; it
imposed the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an colonial rule-of-law to shape
the nature of the relationship in the form of [[treaties]], which
the [[Canadian]] [[government]] violated by reneging on its commitment. Religion was a central part of the colonial project
throughout the [[America]]s as enculturated [[Europe]]an versions of
Christianity were forcefully imposed upon [[Indigenous]] communities. In [[Canada]], the civilizing thrust of Christianity eventually
contributed to the formation of the residential schools. The
complicity of the Christian religious establishment with the
[[government]]’s aim to control and civilize [[Indigenous]] peoples
cannot be overstated. All this is to say that the colonial project
reached into all dimensions of [[Indigenous]] life, including the
cultural, political, social, and the religious.
However, it would be a mistake to reduce [[Canada]]’s colonial
[[history]] to only the initial encounter with [[Indigenous]] people
and subsequent developments in policies of marginalization
and social exclusion like the [[Indian]] Act and the establishment of
reservations and the residential schools. What is now [[Canada]]
was also built and continues to be built by immigrants. Yet,
not all immigrants have been valued to the same degree, a fact
which is unmasked by considering the nation’s troubled [[history]]
in dealing with the diversity of its cultural groups. There are
many examples of discrimination including, among others: the
[[Chinese]] immigration Act ([[1923]]), also known as the [[Chinese]]
exclusion act; the use of indentured [[child]] labour from [[Britain]]

in the 19th century ([[British]] home [[child]]ren, the Bernardo [[child]]ren); the internment of Germans and Hungarian [[Canadian]]s
during the first world war; the internment and confiscation of
[[property]] of [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s during world war two; the discrimination against [[Africa]]n-[[Canadian]]s (Nova Scotia, [[1946]]);
the rabid Jewish antisemitism in [[Quebec]] in the second half of
the twentieth century; and the importing of domestic and temporary/seasonal workers from the Caribbean, the Philippines,
and Latin [[America]] among other places from the [[1950]]s to the
present day.
Two important insights can be gleaned from this list.
First, the notion of “[[white]]ness” does not point to a homogeneous group as can be seen by the discriminatory policies
directed towards “[[white]]” poor/orphaned [[British]] [[child]]ren
and the internment of Germans, Hungarians and [[Italian]]s,
for instance. Whiteness is a chameleon-like social, political, economic construction of ethno-cultural identity tied
to the [[Western]] [[Europe]]an racialized colonial apparatus and
designed to exclude and assimilate. Second, [[white]]ness operates as a normative value system that establishes hierarchies
among ethnic groups. As a result, people from groups who
are racialized tend to fare worse in the long run. Furthermore,
it almost goes without saying that [[white]]ness, like any
other discriminatory structure, is compounded when other
identity markers, like gender, class, dis/ability, education,
nationality, sexual orientation, age, accent, and other factors
are taken into account. Decolonial thinkers remind us that
even these categories are marked by the fact that they have
been constructed within [[Western]] [[Europe]]an epistemological
framing.10

Suffice it to say a fuller analysis of the implication of these questions is
too large for discussion here. See for example (Walsh, [[2007]]) and (Medina,

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

The ugly colonial [[history]] of [[Canada]] is intricately woven with
(cultural and ethno-racial) [[white]]ness as the preferred (predominant) Eurocentric norm for all its inhabitants. Set in place are
social structures and a historical imaginary designed to continually reinforce [[Canada]]’s colonial identity. As Celia Haig-Brown
argues, “simple binary distinctions . . . fail to address the range
of ways that people are a part of this country” (Haig-Brown, [[2009]],
14). Though all immigrants are implicated in processes of colonization, they are not all implicated in the “same ways as those
who came with the clear intention of exploitation and profit.
Many people came for better lives, to escape war and famine, to
seek freedom, to start anew” (Haig-Brown, [[2009]]). People come
to [[Canada]] for a number of different reasons: as political and economic refugees, as s[[kill]]ed labour, as investors. But [[Canada]] also
exercises its power to entice immigrants and temporary workers,
while preventing them from becoming actual residents in the
country. These dynamics are part of the way in which colonial
economic power is played out in and by [[Canada]].
Unsanitizing [[Canada]]’s [[history]] confronts this “historical context of the founding and grounding [[violence]] of the [[Canadian]]
state—[[violence]] directed toward many immigrant and enslaved
peoples, as well as toward [[Indigenous]] peoples” (Shotwell, [[2015]],
65).11 It unmasks our colonial legacy and exposes the utopic myth
of [[Canada]] as a benign multicultural nation. Everyone’s presence
in [[Canada]] is touched by coloniality. It is our collective [[history]].
And it is a [[history]] by which some of us have benefited greatly

11

Volumen V.1
[[2019]]

For Shotwell, a process of “unforgetting,” especially for [[white]] Anglo
[[Canadian]]s, who benefit from [[white]] systemic privilege, is necessary in order
to combat the “colonial status quo [which] involves truly vast apparatuses
and histories” (65). She notes that a “central feature of [[white]] settler colonial subjectivity is forgetting; we live [[white]]ness in part as active ignorance
and forgetting” (58). She also notes that “unforgetting” is only effective
when it is coupled with a commitment to action “to craft a future different
than the horrific past we have inherited and live in the present” (58).

in terms of wealth and status, while others—those condemned
(damnés) to the colonial underside—have experienced oppression, impoverishment, [[racism]], [[violence]] and even [[death]] (Fanon,
[[1963]]). Colonial power structures depend on a wide range of factors, codes, and processes in which [[white]]ness has been one of
the most salient features. More recently though, with the openness to immigration from countries of the Global [[South]], class
and education have gained greater importance. The chameleon
changes its colours to ensure that the colonial apparatus stays
intact through coloniality, in whatever form it needs to take.
This operative colonial power matrix which includes social
and cultural [[white]]ness, among other things, shapes society and
includes our sources of knowledge and ways of being which
are part of what decolonial scholars articulate more broadly
as a “coloniality of being” and “coloniality of knowledge”
(Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]]; Walsh, [[2007]]). Nelson MaldonadoTorres writes that the interconnected forces of colonial power
impact our intersubjective relations as we come to grips with
the “effects of coloniality in lived experience and not only in
the mind” (Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]], 242). In other words,
coloniality shapes and prescribes the way individuals ought to
behave in a society. He argues that a coloniality of being “is
maintained alive in books, in the criteria for academic performance, in cultural patterns, in common sense, in the self-image
of peoples, in aspirations of self, and so many other aspects
of our modern experience. In a way, as modern subjects we
breathe coloniality all the time and every day” (MaldonadoTorres, [[2007]], 243).
Maldonado-Torres proposes a number of strategic possibilities
for decolonization including: borrowing from Fanon—receptive
generosity in which “racialized subjects could give and receive
freely;” suspending one’s identity and offering “one’s life to the
task of achieving decolonial justice;” dialogue and exchange;
confronting the “racial, gender, and sexual hierarchies that were
put in place by [[Europe]]an modernity as it colonized and enslaved

populations throughout the planet;” and opposing the paradigm
of war (Maldonado-Torres, [[2007]], 60–62). However, MaldonadoTorres’ insightful proposal is less help in the context of [[Canada]]
where the notion of [[multiculturalism]] is deployed paradoxically
both as a tool to celebrate diversity and as a mechanism for reinscribing the inherited [[white]] Anglo [[North]] [[Atlantic]] mode of being
as normative. In our view, Nelson-Maldonado’s proposal runs
the risk of romanticizing the work of decolonization but leaves
unchallenged the subtle, complex and hard to detect mechanisms
of coloniality. Taking these factors into account, we argue that,
in the context of [[Canada]], coloniality of being not only affects our
sense of personal and community identity as we have articulated
them, but also impacts that way [[Canadian]]s understand themselves as a nation.

[[Canada]] as the Subject and Object of Colonial
Desire
[[Canada]]’s geopolitical position and status in the global market allows it to become an instrument of colonial power both in
its internal and external capacity to act on smaller players, but
also to be acted upon, by the [[U.S.A.]] and [[Britain]], for example. It
is for this reason that any consideration of the present [[Canadian]]
context necessitates an evaluation of the ways in which [[Canada]]
aspires to function in the global scene imitating present global
economic and military powers. As we have been arguing, [[Canada]]
is marked by coloniality through and through and needs to be
understood as located in the [[America]]s, historically, geo-politically
and culturally. At the same time, we wish to show that while
[[Canada]] participates in the colonial project and benefits from the
present geopolitical configuration, it simultaneously occupies
an in-between identity space as a nation in which it displays
elements of being a colonized society as well. In the larger
interconnected web of historical and present-day colonial powers, [[Canada]] is both a subject and object of colonial desire.

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

[[Canada]] is the subject of colonial desire because it strategically draws from patterns of behaviour by more powerful actors
which continue the legacy of [[Western]] [[Europe]]an [[North]] [[Atlantic]]
imperialism, especially the [[U.S.A.]] and [[Britain]]. It adopts colonizing strategies that seek to reproduce this behaviour in order
to organize itself as a society and as a way to participate in the
larger global theatre. It is not difficult to see how [[Canada]] tailors itself after these countries. For example, former [[Canadian]]
Prime Minister Stephen Harper mimicked a [[U.S.A.]]-style
presidency by limiting “his access to the media, keeping something of a distance, [and] controlling what would be known
and said,” making a show of his trip to Afghanistan, invoking
the Christian God in a [[U.S.A.]]-style “God bless [[Canada]],” and
staging the speech from the throne more as a media-hyped
State of the Union-style address (Haberman, [[2006]]). According
to Arthur Harberman, this behaviour of Harper’s in which
he acted like the [[U.S.A.]] head of state violated the [[Canadian]]
[[parliament]]ary approach in which he is rather the head of a
party and a Member of Parliament, like all the other Members,
responsible to the [[Crown]] as head of state. Of course, there is a
significant irony in the fact that [[Canada]]’s head of state is still
the [[Queen]] of England.
This aspiration towards [[Britain]] is exemplified in recent controversies related to the required swearing of the oath to the
[[Queen]] at citizenship ceremonies. In a Globe and Mail article
which documents the legal case of three would-be citizens who,
for ethical and religious reasons do not wish to swear such an
allegiance, argues in its favour, concluding that “The [[Crown]] is
a powerful and historic symbol. Far from diminishing [[Canadian]]
citizenship, it enhances [[Canada]]” (Globe and Mail, [[2017]]). Emer
O’Toole, another would-be-[[Canadian]], writes in an op-ed for
the Guardian that his socialist beliefs make the allegiance
“anathema to my political con[[[[science]]]]; I’m baffled by otherwise
egalitarian people who are okay with aristocrats inheriting the
position of head of state.” O’Toole continues by articulating the

coloniality behind this symbolic gesture. He writes “As an [[Irish]]
person, I’m aware of the historical oppression of my people and
culture by [[British]] [[colonialism]]” (O’Toole, 2[[014]]).
In both instances [[Canada]]’s complicity with coloniality is
exposed and problematized. The [[U.S.A.]] and [[Britain]] function as
an idealized double-optic which continues to shape [[Canada]]’s
self-perception inside and outside. [[Canada]]’s imaginary (social,
political, economic, cultural, etc. . .) is governed by a type of
coloniality of being which simultaneously imitates and imposes
colonizing social behaviours. Of course, a fuller discussion
of the dynamics at play and the factors contributing to these
dynamics go beyond the scope of this article. Our examples
merely touch the surface of a much more complicated network
of historical, social, political, cultural, and economic factors
and issues that continue to shape [[Canadian]] self-perception
and from which [[Canada]] and [[Canadian]]s benefit enormously;
ability to travel overseas, level of and access to education and
wealth, [[health]]care, etc. However, they serve to illustrate how
the dynamics of coloniality operate even at the highest levels of [[government]]. They also illustrate the profoundly cultural
nature of coloniality which permeates all levels of society and
inevitably has detri[[mental]] effects on entire sectors of the population, especially racialized peoples, in some of the ways we
have shown.
Conversely, [[Canadian]]s also find themselves existing in a
liminal space, vulnerable to [[U.S.A.]] and [[British]] colonializing
whims. [[Canada]] is looked at paternalistically as being a young
nation when compared to its progenitor/motherland, [[Britain]],
and is bullied by its older brother to the [[South]], the [[U.S.A.]] Alan
Lawson describes this position as being “suspended between
‘mother’ and ‘other,’ simultaneously colonized and colonizing” (Lawson, [[2004]], 155) and Lee Maracle writes that “we
are the grand[[child]]ren of an abusive industrial [[British]] parent”
(Maracle, [[2004]], 206). We do not have to go too far to find
examples in the political realm. As a constitutional monarchy

and member of the [[British]] Commonwealth, [[Canada]]’s identity as a nation is still geopolitically situated in relation to the
[[British]] Empire and it resides under the shadow of the present
tempestuous president of the [[U.S.A.]] The dismissal of [[Canada]]
by [[President]] [[Trump]] in anticipation of [[NAFTA]] negotiations
shows the little value the [[U.S.A.]] gives to [[Canada]]’s [[sovereignty]]
(Dale, [[2017]]). There is a long [[history]] of historical subjugation
by [[Britain]] and interventionism by the [[U.S.A.]] [[Canada]] finds
itself deeply in[[flu]]enced, historically, economically and culturally, by the over-bearing and paternalistic attitudes and actions
of these two nations. Caught between, [[Canadian]]s find themselves in a perpetual search for their [[Canadian]] “identity.”

The Implications of Reading Coloniality in
[[Canada]]
In our view, coloniality operates as a range of expressions
in which [[empire]] manifests its power in very concrete ways
that we are still experiencing. The present configuration of
[[Canada]]’s imaginary along with its systems of education and
its social, political, and economic structures are predicated on
inherited colonizing frames which perpetuate the exclusion of,
discrimination against, and [[violence]] towards those who have
been and are othered in ongoing processes that began 500
years ago. We affirm a decolonial stance which involves the
undoing and unlearning of the strategies, approaches, methods and tendencies that wittingly or unwittingly reproduce
this coloniality in all its manifestations. It also involves a systematic interrogation of the wide range of power structures,
consumption, and profit-making which govern all human relations. With others, we dare to confront [[Canada]]’s coloniality
with all of its attendant discriminatory hierarchies, practices,
and systems ([[racism]], sexism, etc. . .) “not [only] as regretful
by-products of modern [[Europe]], but as part of the conditions
that made . . . [[[Canada]]]. . . possible (Lander, [[2000]], 525).

(An)Other [[Canada]] is Possible

According to Roxana Ng, racist, sexist, and xenophobic roots
“underpin the construction of [[Canada]] as a nation. This [[racism]]
began in [[Canada]] with the interventions of [[Europe]]ans convinced
of their superiority to [[Indigenous]] peoples” (Haig-Brown, [[2009]],
8). Engaging this inheritance and facing the fact that coloniality is constitutive of [[Canada]]’s [[history]], [[Canada]]’s formation as a
nation, [[Canada]]’s identity as a nation-state, as well as the way
[[Canadian]]s understand themselves and each other in relation to
these factors, would involve a decolonial turn towards those who
inhabit the underside of coloniality. Himani Bannerji articulates
such a move, stating that “the possibility for constructing a radically different [[Canada]] emerge only from those who have been
“othered” as the insider-outsiders of the nation . . . They serve
to remind us of the [[Canada]] that could exist” (Bannerji, [[2004]],
297). This “other” [[Canada]] goes beyond a liberal recognition of
the others of Empire to include a reclaiming and celebrating of
other epistemologies—the forms of knowledge of [[Indigenous]]
peoples and other ethnocultural groups, a process which is
already underway, as we have seen. It confronts the fact that the
very way [[Canada]] has constructed its epistemologies is based on
[[Western]] [[Europe]]an rationalist Enlightenment thinking.12

According to Catherine Walsh, in our present context of “shifting geopolitical knowledges,” the decolonial turn will include “a renovation and
reconstruction of critical thought in ways that take into account the presentday relations between culture, politics, and economy, [and that] challenge the
hegemony of Eurocentric perspectives, and promote dialogues and thinking
with thought and knowledge ‘others’, including that of Afro and [[Indigenous]]
social movements and intellectuals” (Walsh, [[2007]], 233).

occasion. At the most extreme end of the spectrum, a group of
five “[[white]]” military men, self-described as “Proud Boys” who
are “[[Western]] Chauvinists” disrupted a peaceful [[protest]] on
[[Canada]] Day by Mi-kmaq ([[Indigenous]]) women in [[Halifax]], Nova
Scotia, by yelling “this is a [[British]] Colony.” The women, who
were honouring [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women
were “trying to help, heal, and mourn” (Lagerquist, [[July]] 3,
[[2017]]).13 Other voices ran the gamut from romantically declaring that “at 150, [[Canada]] is a far better place, in a far better
space than ever before — in a world that grows only worse,”
to those who confronted the painful reality of [[racism]] and the
difficulty of fitting in to the normative [[white]]-Anglo expectations of “[[Canadian]]” identity (Cohn, [[2017]]; Jackson et al, [[2017]];
Paradkar, [[2017]]). In the wake of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission and its recommendations, many [[Indigenous]]
voices and allies called for [[[[protest]]s]] against the celebrations
noting that [[Indigenous]] communities have little to celebrate
(Saganash, [[2017]]; Morin, [[2017]]).
Significantly and hopefully, as we cross the threshold of
this 150th anniversary, even those who are inclined to be senti[[mental]] and romantic admit that it is necessary for [[Canada]]
to acknowledge our racialized and gendered violent and traumatic past. For instance, powerful and compelling voices are
calling on [[Canadian]]s and their [[government]] to take concrete
steps towards tangible reconciliation, daring to contemplate
the possibilities of constructing another [[Canada]], “for all of us,
our first people and our most recently arrived people and those
[[Canadian]]s yet to come” (Keenan, [[2017]]). We argue that this
“other” [[Canada]] requires a task of decolonization which engenders the development of new attitudes towards all “others” of/
in [[Canada]] and depends on building movements of solidarity,

Subsequent reports indicate that the military will remove the men from
duty and training pending an investigation and called their actions deplorable. (Lagerquist, [[July]] 4, [[2017]]).

[[alliance]], and resistance between [[Indigenous]] peoples, immigrants, racialized people, and allies. The ethnocultural mosaic
that “makes [[Canada]] great,” and was widely celebrated as the
nation turned 150, also has, as part of its historical narrative,
a legacy of exploitation, oppression, and genocide. The presence of such a rich ethnocultural diversity forces us to rethink
inherited forms of social and political organization that privilege a small racialized sector of the country. It invites us to
reinvent social, political, intellectual, and economic structures
in ways that counter the various forms of coloniality while
seeking ways to make [[Canada]] accountable for its complicity in the present forces of globalizing neoliberal capitalism.
Recognizing [[Canada]]’s rich diversity also means uncovering
the rich range of sources of human knowledge as well as cultural and social resources with which to construct a national
intercultural imaginary of [[Canada]] as a welcoming home for
the many. It is time for [[Canada]] to confront the skeletons in its
closet, abandon the relics of imperialism and colonization, and
to decolonize itself by truly embracing all its peoples.
