OF TREATIES AND TORTURE:
HOW THE SUPREME COURT CAN
RESTRAIN THE EXECUTIVE
Jeffrey C. Goldman

Introduction1

The [[Bush]] administration's original (and now superseded)
"torture memos" strain contemporary understandings of the [[[[United]]]]

[[States]]' obligations under the Convention Against Torture.2 These
documents also mock traditional understandings of the relationship
between international law and [[treaties]] and of the executive's power

to interpret and apply them.3 Perhaps most alarming are the

administration's attempts to undermine the spirit of both domestic

legislation and international law by employing a "strict
constructionist" interpretive methodology while embracing an
expansive view of executive power. The [[Bush]] administration's

([[2004]]), which concludes, in answer to its title, that the president is so bound.

Court with legitimate, constitutional reasons to overrule
[[congress]]ional and executive [[treaty]] interpretations. Although U.S.
courts long ago adopted a rule of construction that accorded [[treaties]]
and statutes equal weight,8 jurists added a caveat: "fujnless it is for
some reason distinguishable from other laws, the rule which [a [[treaty]]]
gives may be displaced by the legislative power, at its pleasure."9

Treaties dealing with peremptory norms are categorically
different from other [[treaties]]. Human rights [[treaties]], and related
implementing legislation, grant specific and far-reaching rights
directly to individuals. These rights, by virtue of reason, should be
held by courts as equal to constitutional freedoms and rights; like
those freedoms and rights, neither the executive nor the legislative
branch should be able to alter or infringe them in any but the most
compelling circumstances (and certainly not unilaterally, as by
executive order). The Supreme Court's recognition of this
equivalence would give it an axe to wield that it cannot carry into
interpretative [[battle]]s regarding other [[treaties]].10 This axe can restore
the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial
branches and ensure that the [[[[United]]]] [[States]], which has led the world
in recognizing and promoting human rights, retains its high moral
ground.
This Note argues that because human rights are fundamental in
nature, and because the exercise of constitutional rights is predicated
on the enjoyment of more basic human rights, courts should treat
human rights [[treaties]] differently than other international agreements
the [[[[United]]]] [[States]] has signed or ratified. Part I of this Note reviews

the judiciary's understanding of the relationship between

granting most-favored-nation status to [[Russia]] because "[t]here is ... nothing in the mere fact
that a [[treaty]] is a law, which would prevent [[congress]] from repealing it"); see also Chew Heong v.

international and domestic law. It then presents
jus cogens norms in international law and demon
has entered the canon of such norms. Part II begin
of the function and interpretation of [[treaties]]

argues that human rights [[treaties]] should be categorically

distinguished from those dealing with other subjects. It then argues

that equating human rights with constitutional rights is both

appropriate and necessary if human rights [[treaties]] are to achieve their

full potential. Part III suggests a limit for the executive's [[treaty]]
interpretation power and specifically demonstrates that executive
power to terminate [[treaties]] unilaterally does not extend to human
rights [[treaties]]. Part III then argues that recognizing human rights
[[treaties]] as a distinct category offers the judiciary a way to restrain the
executive without running afoul of the political question doctrine.

I. International Law, Peremptory Norms, and Torture

This Part examines the relationship between international law,
peremptory norms, and torture. Section A describes the [[history]] of
U.S. courts' recognition of international law and the Supreme Court's
understanding of the relationship between domestic and international
law. Section B defines j us cogens (peremptory) norms and their place
in the international law hierarchy and establishes torture as a jus
cogens norm.

A. Recognition of International Law by U.S. Courts

International law "consists of rules and principles of general
application dealing with the conduct of states and of international
organizations and with their relations . . . [including] some of their

relations with persons."11 These rules are derived from [[treaties]],

customs, and principles common to major world legal systems.12 This

definition, however, does not explain how U.S. courts have

traditionally treated international law in general, and customary
international law and jus cogens specifically. This Section briefly
describes U.S. jurisprudence regarding international law.

Furthermore, U.S. courts have also recognized

court acknowledged that there were "few, if any, issues in
international law ... on which opinion seems to be so united as the
limitations on a state's power to torture."44 And, in discussing whether

the [[[[United]]]] Nations Charter conveyed individual rights to citizens of
member countries, the court added that "the guaranties include, at a
bare minimum, the right to be free from torture."45 Interestingly,
Filartiga was decided almost fifteen years prior to the [[[[United]]]] [[States]]'

accession to the Convention Against Torture, supporting the
contention that torture had already achieved the status of a

peremptory, binding norm prior to the Convention.46

As a jus cogens norm, torture deserves greater protection than

other rights - perhaps even greater protection than other
constitutional rights. As discussed in Part II, this heightened
protection suggests a way to distinguish [[treaties]] by subject matter.
II. Distinguishing Human Rights Treaties

The previous Part established that the U.S. is boun

international law and that torture is widely recognized as a j

norm under international law. This Part discusses the rel
between international and domestic law, focusing on treatie

law. Section A also reviews U.S. courts' traditiona
[[treaties]] and the relationship between [[treaties]], in
domestic law. Section B equates the substantive r
human rights [[treaties]], especially jus cogens norms,
rights.

At the outset, the looming presence of Goldwater v. Carter1
should be acknowledged. In Goldwater, a plurality of the Court held
that a challenge to [[President]] Carter's unilateral termination of a
commercial [[treaty]] with [[Taiwan]] was a nonjusticiable political
question.48 Although Goldwater has precedential value, its reasoning
should apply only to certain types of [[treaties]]. Specifically, this Note

argues that Goldwatefs nonjusticiability rule should apply only to
commercial [[treaties]] and should not apply to human rights [[treaties]]. As

this Note explains in Section A and further develops in Part III.A,
commercial and human rights [[treaties]] can be distinguished on the
basis of purpose (contractual vs. codification) and subject matter
(commercial vs. human rights). These distinctions are crucial in
determining whether nonjusticiability should apply.

A. Methods for Distinguishing Treaties
A [[treaty]] is "[a]n agreement formally signed, ratified, or adhered

to between two nations or sovereigns; an international agreement
concluded between two or more states in written form and governed
by international law."49 A [[treaty]] is, essentially, a "contract between
nations" and is usually treated like a contract rather than a legislative

act.50 Madison commented that "[t]he object of [[treaties]] is the
regulation of intercourse with foreign nations and is external."51

international agreements typically focused on economic,
transportation-communication, cultural-technical, diplomatic, and
military issues.55

Historically, U.S. courts have interpreted [[treaties]] "in the manner

and to the extent [to] which the parties have declared, and not
otherwise."56 The Supreme Court has no power "to alter, amend, or
add to any [[treaty]], by inserting any clause" because that "would be to
make, and not to construe a [[treaty]]."57 Treaties generally are deemed
to have the same weight as federal law but are not superior to the

Constitution.58

The remainder of this Section describes the traditional

classification scheme for [[treaties]] and suggests an alternate
methodology. The Section concludes by asserting that human rights
[[treaties]] can be clearly distinguished from other [[treaties]] based on their
subject matter and applies the proposed methodology to prove the
argument. Some [[treaties]] that seek to achieve multiple objectives or

that take a comprehensive approach to problem-solving might be
difficult to classify, but this Note is not concerned with such

borderline cases. The classification scheme described in this Note will

claimed that the [[[[United]]]] [[States]] was bound by [[treaty]] to honor [[Spain]]'s

holding that it did not automatically confer [[property]] rights on those
who received grants when the land was under [[Spanish]] control; rather,
such grants were only valid once confirmed by [[Congress]].70

to avoid a dispute with the political branches that might have been

A [[treaty]] is in its nature a contract between two nations, not a legislative act. It
does not generally effect, of itself, the object to be accomplished, especially so far as
its operation is infra-territorial; but is carried into execution by the sovereign power
of the respective parties to the instrument.
In the [[[[United]]]] [[States]] a different principle is established. Our constitution declares
a [[treaty]] to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of

justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself without
the aid of any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation import a
contract, when either of the parties engages to perform a particular act, the [[treaty]]
addresses itself to the political, not the judicial department; and the legislature must
execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court.

consolidating control over what would eventually become a
significant portion of the [[[[United]]]] [[States]]73 - and possibly anticipated
and enabled the Manifest Destiny movement which would flourish in

the [[1840]]s.74

Marshall's distinction between self-executing and non-selfexecuting [[treaties]], then, might not reflect an overarching judicial
philosophy so much as a convenient fix for exigent circumstances.75

Indeed, the Court itself has on occasion rejected Marshall's
dichotomy. For example, in the Head Money Cases™ the Court
distinguished between contractual [[treaties]], which conferred no

individual rights, and statutory [[treaties]], which did.77 The Head Money
Cases dealt with the validity of an excise tax on immigrants - a tax

its rights of dominion over a country of which it is in possession, and which it claims
under a [[treaty]]; if the legislature has acted on the construction thus asserted, it is not in
its own courts that this construction is to be denied. A question like this respecting

the boundaries of nations, is, as has been truly said, more a political than a legal
question ....

Id. at 309. Note that the [[treaty]] in question is of a contractual, rather than a lawmaking type,
dealing as it does with possession of land - which is immediately recognizable as a real [[property]]
transaction.

72. Id. ("If those departments which are entrusted with the foreign intercourse of the
nation . . . have unequivocally asserted its rights of dominion over a ... possession ... it is not in
its own courts that [a [[treaty]] interpretation taken by the political branches] is to be denied.").
73. Marshall reached a similar decision, on similar grounds, in the earlier case of Johnson v.

M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 ([[1823]]), in which he held a [[property]] claim raised by [[Indian]]s
invalid because their land was "discovered" by [[Europe]]ans and "if an uninhabited country be
discovered . . . the country becomes the [[property]] of the discoverers," id. at 595.

[[States]] had the right and duty to expand throughout North America." THE AMERICAN

75. That Marshall's judicial approach was pragmatic is not particularly controversial. See,
e.g., Christopher L. Eisgruber, John Marshall's Judicial Rhetoric, [[1996]] SUP. Ct. Rev. 439, 445
(describing and analyzing Marshall's adjudicative style). As Professor Eisgruber comments:
John Marshall faced the task of demonstrating that crucial and difficult constitutional

questions could be resolved without leaving [[American]] politics subject to the

undisciplined play of either legislative or judicial discretion. An important part of
Marshall's response was tactical .... Marshall aggressively took advantage of political

circumstances to deflect attacks upon the Court and to secure useful precedents.

acknowledging that a [[treaty]]'s subject matte
executing nature, granted individual rights.90

Rauscher is not the only example of the Supreme Court
distinguishing [[treaties]] based on subject-matter classification. For
example, in considering whether certain provisions of the Jay [[Treaty]]
of [[1794]] between the [[[[United]]]] [[States]] and the [[[[United]]]] [[King]]dom survived
the [[War]] of [[1812]], the Court unanimously held: "The doctrine . . . that
war ipso facto annuls [[treaties]] of every kind ... is repudiated by the

great weight of modern authority; and the view now commonly
accepted is that 'whether the stipulations of a [[treaty]] are annulled by
war depends upon their intrinsic character.'"91 Specifically, the Court

distinguished [[treaties]] "having a political character" from those
dealing with substantive issues, such as possession of [[property]] by
nationals, boundary decisions, and "provisions which represent
completed acts."92 The Court ultimately distinguished [[treaty]] articles
vesting rights "permanent in character" which were "by their very

nature . . . fixed and continuing" from those rights which were

"wholly promissory and prospective."93

3. Human Rights Treaties and the Subject-Matter Distinction.
Applying the distinction between [[treaties]] vesting personal and
permanent rights (human rights [[treaties]]) and promissory rights
(contractual agreements) to the Goldwater holding, a commercial
[[treaty]] (like that in Goldwater) might confer derivative individual
rights, but a human rights [[treaty]] clearly implicates rights "permanent

in character."94 Whereas nations might contract for certain privileges

precedent for this analysis. In the Head Money Cases, the Court held that
[a] [[treaty]], then, is a law of the land, as an act of [[Congress]] is, whenever its provisions

prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or subject may be

determined. And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice,
that court resorts to the [[treaty]] for a rule of decision for the case before it as it would
to a statute.

bargains, to speak of [[treaties]] as creating bargain
human beings seems offensive.95 Unfortunately,
courts have generally relied on Chief Justice Mar

rather than the substance of [[treaties]] to determine whether [[treaties]]

create individual rights. Sadly for both human rights activists and
potential torture victims, Marshall's dichotomy quite often has been
applied to human rights [[treaties]]. For example, a district court held
that the [[[[United]]]] Nations Charter was non-self-executing and therefore
did "not vest any of the plaintiffs with individual legal rights."96
Similarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR)97 has been found to be non-self-executing.98 Specifically
because of their non-self-executing nature, neither the ICCPR nor the
Convention Against Torture were deemed to have created "a private
right of action under which the plaintiffjs could] successfully state a

claim."99

In applying Marshall's dichotomy to human rights [[treaties]], courts
have created a quagmire of case law that is replete with exceptions.

For example, in evaluating the applicability of the Geneva

Conventions to General Manuel Noriega, a court noted that although
most international [[treaties]] have been found to be non-self-executing,

this determination must be made for each [[treaty]] individually.100

Geneva Conventions to justify its conclusion, th

[[treaty]] expressly or impliedly provides a private

self-executing and can be invoked by the in

torturous route to discerning individual rights from

neither to individuals seeking protection under
burdened with the laws' enforcement.

Rather than relying on a structural analysis of whether a [[treaty]] is

self-executing, courts should use the content, substance, and purpose
of the [[treaty]] to determine whether [[treaties]] confer private, individual
rights. Human rights [[treaties]] are prime contenders for conferring
private rights based on their content and purpose because "[h]uman
rights conventions address the rights of individuals" by their very
nature.105 This proposal is not unprecedented: as the Noriega court

noted, "[i]t must not be forgotten that the [Geneva] Conventions
have been drawn up first and foremost to protect individuals."106

Categorically distinguishing human rights conventions and other

international agreements is not too great a task for the judiciary.
Traditionally, of course, the subjects of international law have been
states - and only states.107 But [[treaties]] and other international
instruments have moved beyond the limited subject matter that the

example, failure to comply with either human rights [[treaties]] or
international law norms would weaken the ability of the [[[[United]]]]
[[States]] to impose such norms on other nations.112 Ratifying a [[treaty]]
like the Convention Against Torture also bolstered the credibility of
the [[[[United]]]] [[States]] in the human rights arena. In hearings related to
the ratification, one witness told [[Congress]] that "[t]he [[[[United]]]] [[States]]
has played a leading role in the development of the major human
rights [[treaties]], but has declined to ratify many of them."113 Ratifying

the Convention Against Torture signaled that the [[[[United]]]] [[States]]

constitutional rights as marriage and procreation
need not be explicitly enumerated. If human righ
codify, rather than legislate, human rights derived

must be at least as judicially cognizable as nonenumerated
constitutional rights. Furthermore, jus cogens norms ought to be
recognized as a superior kind of right; it is logically inconceivable that
a court would protect the right to marry but turn a blind eye to more
fundamental threats to life and [[liberty]], such as torture.119

Additionally, a ratified [[treaty]] can be said to embody the
sovereign will of the [[[[United]]]] [[States]]. But such [[sovereignty]] "reside[s] in

the people, for whom the [[President]] and the Senate [are] merely

agents."120 At a minimum, then, human rights [[treaties]] should be able
to add to the rights and liberties enjoyed by [[American]]s, similar to the
way in which other kinds of constitutive documents create obligations
and privileges. Rights deemed to be fundamental, of course, include
not only limitations prohibiting certain [[government]] actions but also
positive [[government]] obligations.121

Given the Supreme Court's reluctance, until the [[1920]]s, to protect
civil liberties, and its current bent toward strict constructionism, it is

not surprising that the Court has failed to find many positive
obligations created by international human rights agreements.122 But

the Court's reluctance to do so, and the slow development of

domestic human rights jurisprudence generally, does not mean that
the Court should, or will, turn a blind eye to human rights claims in
the future - especially when such claims arise from [[treaties]].123 [[States]]
may be the actors that draft and ratify human rights agreements, but

Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485-86 ([[1965]]) (recognizing the right to use

contraception).

119. Although [[slavery]], also prohibited as a jus cogens norm, was embedded in, and perhaps
even essential to the ratification of, the Constitution, the fact that the Framers failed to
completely embody the ideals they drew upon in shaping a new country's [[government]] should
not be used to justify violating an analogous norm two hundred years later.

Finally, as consensus has developed that at least some
international human rights norms - jus cogens norms like torture and
genocide - do guarantee, at a minimum, the right to be free from the
activity prohibited, it is entirely appropriate for courts to recognize
such rights as coequal with constitutional rights.128 In Banco Nacional

de [[Cuba]] v. Sabbatino™ for example, the Court noted that "the
greater the degree of codification or consensus concerning a

particular area of international law, the more appropriate it is for the
judiciary to render decisions regarding it."130

Recognizing jus cogens norms as coequal with constitutional
rights would also be consistent with existing jurisprudence. Further,
such recognition would not run afoul of the Court's concerns that it
would be infringing on the political branches' spheres of in[[flu]]ence.131

exclusivity, given the important signal proclamation of adherence to
human rights norms sends. Yet, in this context, the [[government]]'s
willingness to allow courts to enforce promises made by the political
branches may send an even stronger signal.132

Finally, treating jus cogens norms as constitutional rights could

expand the class of individuals protected by those norms. Courts
could feel comfortable extending the protection of the [[[[United]]]] [[States]]

not just to [[American]] citizens but to anyone whose fundamental
human rights are violated by an [[American]] national under the

nationality and territorial principles. Under the nationality principle,
u[a] state may prosecute its nationals for crimes committed anywhere
in the world."133 Under the territorial principle, "[e]very state [can]
claim[] jurisdiction over crimes committed in its own territory."134

Although these principles originated with regard to criminal

activities, a strong argument can be made that violations of human
rights constitute criminal acts.135 On a purely domestic level, the
Supreme Court has acknowledged that noncitizen residents, even if
present on U.S. territory illegally, are entitled to some rights.136 Surely
fundamental human rights should rank among them.

III. Constraining the Executive, Empowering the Judiciary

constitutional rights under [[American]] law, and if courts are competent
to hear cases arising under human rights [[treaties]], to what extent can

the power to violate or abrogate them. Court

confronted with such an attempt, should not fe

individual rights. Further, courts should construe [[treaty]]

interpretations or modifications as unconstitutional when inconsistent

with binding international law. Under this theory, the president
cannot unilaterally abrogate a human rights [[treaty]] or, at most, can
only abrogate those [[treaties]] not dealing with jus cogens norms. Nor
can the executive promulgate an interpretation of a [[treaty]] that is
inconsistent with international law. In other words, human rights and

related [[treaties]] can constrain the executive and empower the

judiciary.
A. Limitations on the Executive's Foreign Affairs Powers
This Section contends that the president is not solely responsible
for international affairs, suggests some limitations on the president's
ability to interpret and execute [[treaties]], and shows that the president
lacks the power to abrogate human rights [[treaties]] codifying jus cogens
norms.

Perhaps, then, the Court wants to avoid a m
opinion. One of the justifications for the Bus

strained definition of torture was that there was no international

consensus regarding the degree of suffering required to constitute
torture.167 But, if the Convention merely codified international law
and neither defined the offense nor legislated its prohibition, the

Court surely would be able to ascertain some definition of what
constitutes torture. After all, one Justice famously remarked

regarding obscenity, that he knew it when he saw it; surely torture
however difficult to define, is equally recognizable in the majority o
cases.168 And, if the [[Bush]] administration's definition conflicted wit
the commonly understood definition of torture, construing a human
rights [[treaty]] as vesting individual rights would provide the Court with

a clear rationale for rejecting the administration's definition. As th
arbiter of the meaning of constitutional rights, the judicial branch

and not the executive, should bear responsibility for, and asser
authority over, the interpretation of human rights [[treaties]].169
The [[Bush]] administration also claimed that a defense of

"necessity" justified contravening not just the Convention A
Torture, but also relevant domestic legislation.170 But the Co

criminalizes torture only outside the [[[[United]]]] [[States]], the Convention Against Tortu
reasonably understood to permit torture committed by a [[government]] against its own
a human rights [[treaty]] is to mean anything, especially in the context of vesting co
rights, it must be understood as conferring protections domestically at least as gr
granted to individuals residing outside U.S. territory. Compare Hawkins v. Compa
33 F. Supp. 2d 1244, 1255 (CD. Cal. [[1999]]) (noting that there are no reported cases r
cause of action under any jus cogens norm for acts committed by U.S. governme
against U.S. citizens), with Filartiga v. Pena-Irala, 630 F.2d 876, 884 (2d Cir. [[1980]]) (
the court knows of "no assertion by any contemporary state of a right to torture
citizens").

to reject any definition that derogates from it, ev

the executive, to the degree required to prote

"penumbras and emanations."172 The Court

consistently with its own precedent and could

political question doctrine by pointing to controlli
as [[treaties]], customs, and other sources of internat

the kind of judicially manageable standard found lacking in
Goldwater. Such an approach would give the Court a legitimate
reason to supersede either political branch's opinion while

simultaneously avoiding accusations of ideological or political bias.
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has opted for none of these
approaches to date. In [[2004]], in fact, it declined to interpret and apply

international human rights law, accepting the Senate's declaration
that the ICCPR is non-self-executing and therefore does not confer
any individual rights.173 Fortunately, the Court did not entirely close
the door to such an approach. It merely insisted that "any claim based
on the present-day law of nations . . . rest on a norm of international

character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a
specificity comparable to the features of ... 18th-century

paradigms"174 and noted that "the door is still ajar subject to vigilant
doorkeeping"175 and "independent judicial recognition of actionable

international norms."176

A decision that human rights [[treaties]], because of their unique
nature and function, should be treated differently from other [[treaties]],

and specifically that jus cogens norms deserve special status, would
allow the Court to constrain the executive without raising the fear of
an out-of-control judiciary.
Conclusion

Understandings of both [[treaties]] and rights have evolved

complex than it was in the eighteenth century; as a result,
