### The appointment of William Johnson in [[1755]] as His

```
Britannic Majesty's "Sole Agent for and Superintendent of the
Affairs of our faithful subjects and allies, the six united Nations
of [[Indian]]s and their Confederates in the [[North]]ern Parts of
[[North]] [[America]]," created a formal, imperial and centralized
[[Indian]] Department to direct the affairs of [[Native]] peoples on
behalf of the [[British]] [[Crown]].1 Prior to the pivotal in[[flu]]ence of
the regime of Sir William Johnson ([[1755]]-74), [[Indian]] affairs in
```

### colonial [[America]] had been marked by a long, vexing and

### generally rudderless period of imperial "salutary neglect."

```
Inter-colonial land rivalries and wrangling disunity had only
further complicated [[British]]-[[Indian]] relations which [[flu]]ctuated
between the benign and the intolerable. But by the [[1750]]s, the
looming and final conflict with [[France]] for paramountcy in
```

### [[North]] [[America]] turned [[British]] vacillation into resolve. The

```
appointment by royal commission of a single [[Crown]] official for
the administration and management of [[Indian]] Affairs was
```

### therefore a sensible and long overdue imperial initiative.

```
Finally, after one hundred and fifty years of permanent [[British]]
settlement along the eastern shores of the "new world" a formal
and centralized policy for the [[indigenous]] or [[Native]] peoples had
emanated from [[Britain]]. The cohesive vehicle for implementing
the policy directives was the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department, the
forerunner of the present Department of [[Indian]] and [[North]]ern

and maintain the allegiance of the [[Native]] peoples to the royal
cause. As a result, and especially in the post-[[1774]] years against
the common enemy (the [[America]]ns), an enduring and symbiotic
relationship evolved between the [[Native]] peoples and the [[British]]
[[Crown]] which was rooted in the mutual need and desire for
"protection and survival."2 [[British]] [[Indian]] policy from [[1774]] to
[[1815]] was thus geared to ensure the preservation and defense of
```

### [[Canada]] through the military use and assistance of "His

Majesty's [[Indian]] Allies."  
The [[Native]] peoples were not duped by this [[British]] scheme,  
and demonstrated an equal shrewdness in manipulating [[Crown]]

### officials in order to preserve traditional tribal lands and

```
culture. Yet the funda[[mental]] and significant difference was that
the [[British]] manipulated successfully. Perhaps the [[Indian]]s faced
a hopeless task in attempting to stem the tide of the frontier.
Nonetheless, the results were conclusive, for while the Iroquois
lost their ancient castles along the Finger Lakes of Upper [[New]]
York, and later the tribes of the Ohio Valley were foresaken, the
[[British]], by securing invaluable [[Indian]] assistance, defeated the
[[French]] and then, more particularly, defended successfully the
[[Crown]]'s interest in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] from the [[America]]n
invaders of [[1812]].
The success of [[British]] [[Indian]] policy during the pre-[[War]] of
[[1812]] years can be demonstrated by detailing a few examples.
```

### Throughout the Seven Years' [[War]], for instance, Johnson

managed to retain the loyalty of the [[Mohawk]] and others of the  
Six Nations Confederacy of Iroquois in the conflict between  
[[Britain]] and [[France]] for imperial supremacy in [[North]] [[America]].  
His nominal victory at the [[battle]] of Lake George in [[September]]  
[[1755]] against the [[French]] regulars of Baron Dieskau, held the  
wavering Iroquois neutral for nearly three years, in spite of  
subsequent [[French]] successes at Fort Bull and Oswego in [[1756]],  
Fort William Henry in [[1757]], and Ticonderoga in [[1758]]. But a

### Fort Niagara in [[July]] [[1759]] against a [[French]] relief column,

coupled with the fall of [[Quebec]] two months later, ended [[French]]  
imperial ambitions in [[North]] [[America]].  
In [[April]] [[1775]], less than a year after the [[death]] of Sir William  
Johnson, the 'shots heard round the world' at Lexington and  
Concord initiated a cruel and bitter civil war and [[rebellion]] in  
colonial [[America]]. Once again, the military support of [[Native]]  
peoples was vital to the [[Crown]]'s vested interest in [[America]].  
[[British]] [[Indian]] policy was successful during these years in large  
measure because of the several tribes that had long opposed the  
intrusion into their lands of their hereditary foe, the [[America]]n  
backwoodsman. [[Native]] peoples were thus thrown into a natural

### military [[alliance]] with the [[British]] [[Crown]], and against the

```
common enemy.
```

## Yet at the peace negotiations of [[1783]], [[British]] pleni

### potentiaries "sold the [[Indian]]s to [[Congress]]" and transferred

[[sovereignty]] of all [[Indian]]?held lands south of the [[Great]] Lakes  
and west of the Mississippi River, to the new [[United]] [[States]]?  
the first abandonment.5 The [[warrior]]s were "thunderstruck."  
They had not lost their war nor their land. Indeed in [[June]] and  
[[August]] [[1782]], the [[Indian]]s had won two successive and decisive  
victories at Sandusky and Blue Licks against the [[America]]ns. In

### the latter engagement, the legendary Daniel Boone of

### Kentucky was among the routed.7 Following some hasty

```
rethinking, prompted by the fear of [[Indian]] reprisals, the [[British]]
```

### decided to retain the eastern posts; and the [[warrior]]s, now

### encouraged and supplied by His Majesty's [[government]],

continued the struggle to preserve and defend [[aboriginal]] lands.

finally collapsed at the [[battle]] of Fallen Timbers in [[August]] [[1794]].  
At this critical moment, the [[British]] at nearby Fort Miami,  
despite the most avowed promises to the contrary, slammed  
shut the gates of the fort, and assumed a lofty position of  
splendid isolation.8 The formalization of the Jay [[Treaty]] with  
the [[America]]n republic soon after stipulated in part the removal  
of the [[British]] from the western post by [[June]] [[1796]]. Joseph  
Brant, the [[Mohawk]] chief and Loyalist, tersely summarized the  
situation by stating that "this is the second time the poor  
[[Indian]]s have been left in the lurch."

### [[British]] [[Indian]] policy between [[1775]] and [[1796]] had been

```
effective and coldly calculating. The new Loyalist settlements
```

### north of the lakes and rivers at Amherstburg, Sandwich,

```
[[New]]ark, Quinte and along the upper St. Lawrence, protected as
they had been for thirteen years by a convenient [[Indian]] barrier,
prospered and gained a measure of security, while to the south,
[[warrior]]s fought and died, not to preserve and defend [[British]]
[[Canada]], but in a vain attempt to retain ancient tribal lands.
```

### Between [[1796]] and [[1807]] the in[[flu]]ence and prestige of the

### [[British]] [[Indian]] Department waned to insignificance as the

```
[[Indian]]s were no longer needed as military allies. During these
quiet years, expenditures were drastically reduced, and the
```

### department was re-organized. In a "Plan for the Future

### Government of the [[Indian]] Department" in [[June]] [[1796]], the

```
position of Superintendent of [[Indian]] Affairs was established for
each of the replacement forts in Upper [[Canada]].11 As a result,

for instance, Matthew Elliott was appointed superintendent for  
the new [[British]] post at Amherstburg. Although the traditional  
military role of the department had reached a nadir at this  
time, the superintendents were nonetheless instructed to "use

### the utmost diligence to preserve and promote friendship

```
between the troops and [[Indian]]s... and to maintain harmony
```

### at the [[King]]'s (new) posts."12 The wisdom of attempting to

maintain the chain of friendship [[alliance]] proved prophetic. The  
"Chesapeake Affair" of [[June]] [[1807]] and the bellicose reaction by  
an aroused [[America]]n public for a redemption of national honor  
produced a fear of invasion in the weakly defended settlement  
of the [[Canada]]s. In particular, the position of Upper [[Canada]] was

### precarious because the defensive strategy devised by the

```
[[British]], already heavily burdened with the Napoleonic war, was
to preserve the fortress of [[Quebec]] and subordinate all other
```

### considerations. Once again, the future security, and even

```
survival, of Upper [[Canada]] was to be largely dependent on the
allegiance and fighting qualities of His Majesty's [[Indian]] Allies.
```

### As a result, the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department was quickly

```
restored to a respectful position of prominence as it was to play
an integral role in combating this new danger.
During the winter of [[1807]]-08, Sir James Craig, the captain
```

### general and governor-in-chief of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]],

```
developed a policy for the frontier which was to guide the
conduct of the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department for the next three
hectic years. Craig reasoned that in the event of a war, the
[[Indian]]s would not be idle, and if the [[British]] did not use them,
they undoubtedly would be "employed against us."13 Therefore,
```

### the [[Indian]]s must be conciliated, but their chiefs must be

### persuaded not to engage in a premature attack on the

[[America]]ns. Thus, cautioned Craig, the officers of the [[Indian]]  
Department should avoid making any commitment with them  
at least in public. In a dispatch to a worried Francis Gore, the  
lieutenant governor of Upper [[Canada]], Craig noted the "long  
lasting ties" between the [[King]] and the tribes, and suggested

[[1964]]).

that provisions be supplied to the [[Indian]]s to enable them to
```

### protect themselves against the [[America]]ns who "obviously

```
desired to take their country."14 Craig ordered that "the officers
```

### of the [[Indian]] Department must be diligent and active, the

```
communications must be constant, these topics must be held up
to them not merely in [[Great]] Councils and public assemblies,
they should be privately urged to some of their leading men,
```

### with whom endeavours should be used to lead them to a

confidence with us."  
The dual [[Indian]] policy of Craig, one public and one private,  
was very reminiscent of the immediate post-[[1783]] efforts. As  
before, the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department was to renew the old  
courtship rituals, and secure [[Indian]] loyalty to the [[King]], and  
thus preserve [[British]] imperial and territorial jurisdiction in  
Upper [[Canada]] by confounding the expansionist ambitions of the  
[[United]] [[States]]. Gore was enthusiastic about the plan and sent  
William Claus, the deputy superintendent general of [[Indian]]  
Affairs, to the [[British]] post at Amherstburg, the key [[Indian]]  
center in the province, where he was to assemble the chiefs,  
"consult privately" with them and remind them of the "Artful  
and Clandestine manner, in which the [[America]]ns have obtained  
possession of their lands, and of their obvious intention of  
ultimately possessing themselves of the whole and driving the  
[[Indian]]s out of the Country."16 However, the officers of the  
department were reminded to dissuade the tribes from any  
warlike action until or unless Britian should be at war with the

### [[United]] [[States]].

```
In the spring of [[1808]] several [[Indian]] bands began to assemble
at Amherstburg to hear the [[British]] speak in council. For the
```

### officers of the [[Indian]] Department, the implementation of

### Craig's policy required delicate and intricate negotiations,

### particularly since "the [[Indian]] Nations owing to the long

```
continuance of Peace have been neglected by us, and from the
considerable curtailments made in the Presents to those People
it appears, that the retaining of their attachment to the [[King]]'s

Interests has not of late years been thought an object worthy of
```

### serious consideration."17 As a consequence, William Claus,

Matthew Elliott and others, worked diligently to regain the  
affections of the [[Indian]]s. In one council, a Shawnee contingent  
under Captain Johnny, Blackbeard, and the Buffalo, was told

### that the [[King]] was trying to maintain peace with the

```
[[America]]ns, but if he failed, the [[Indian]]s could expect to hear
from the [[British]] and together they would regain the country
taken from them by the [[America]]ns. Heartened by this news,
[[Indian]] [[warrior]]s and chiefs, including the in[[flu]]ential Shawnee
leader Tecumseh who, like Pontiac and Joseph Brant before
```

### him, dreamed of a united [[Indian]] confederacy, gathered in

```
increasing numbers at Amherstburg to meet with the [[British]].
Although the innocuous public councils were conducted with
great decorum, formality, and military pomp, the private
communications with select chiefs (the backroom politics of the
```

### day) were where the real strategy was formulated and

### entrenched. Yet, in spite of the different [[Indian]] Nations

collecting on the Wabash to preserve their country from any  
encroachments, the tribes remained somewhat wary of promised  
[[British]] support. In fact, Major-General Isaac Brock noted that  
"before we can expect an active co-operation on the part of the  
[[Indian]]s the reduction of Detroit and Michilimackinac must  
convince that people, who conceive themselves to have been  
sacrificed in [[1794]], to our policy, that we are earnestly engaged  
in the war."18 In spite of these justifiable [[Indian]] concerns, the  
efforts of the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department in renewing the chain  
of friendship at Amherstburg was an unqualified success.  
For the next two years tribal delegates constantly visited the  
[[British]] at Amherstburg to pledge their support to the [[King]] and  
to receive gifts and provisions in return. The department,  
receiving no instructions to the contrary, continued to win and  
maintain the allegiance of the various tribes. By the summer of  
[[1810]], [[Indian]] frustration and anger at [[America]]n encroachments

### on their lands and [[British]] [[Indian]] Department inspiration,

combined to make the [[Indian]] appetite for war increasingly

difficult to control. In [[July]], a Sauk and Fox delegation arrived  
at Amherstburg and requested clothing, kettles, muskets, shot,  
and powder. In council, Elliott urged the [[Indian]]s to "keep your  
eyes fixed on me; my tomahawk is now up; be you ready, but do  
not strike until I give the signal."19 This speech exhilarated the  
tribes who were now most enthusiastic about the prospects of a

"must not expect any assistance" from the [[British]].22 By the  
summer of [[1811]] the officers of the [[Indian]] Department were  
striving frantically to stall the [[Indian]] war by attempting to

### [[Indian]]-[[America]]n and Anglo-[[America]]n relations rapidly

deteriorated. Following the [[battle]] of Tippecanoe on 7 [[November]]

the [[America]]ns charged that "the whole of the [[Indian]]s on this  
frontier have been completely armed and equipped out of the

throughout the spring of [[1812]], following the latest instructions
of using "your utmost endeavours to promote His Majesty's
[[Indian]] Interest in general," the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department
secretly prepared the tribes for war.24 By [[June]] of [[1812]] when the

[[warrior]]s for the commencement of military action.  
Nowhere was the success of the long-standing and evolving  
[[British]] [[Indian]] policy better demonstrated than during the [[War]]  
of [[1812]]. From the moment hostilities commenced, the fighting  
efforts of His Majesty's [[Indian]] Allies were generally successful,  
particularly during the first few critical summer months of  
[[1812]], as evidenced by a series of [[Indian]] inspired victories at  
such places as Michilimackinac and along the Detroit River at  
Brownston, Maguaga (Monguagon) and Detroit.25 The [[Native]]  
leaders came from many tribes and regions of the [[Great]] Lakes.

arduous campaigning against much superior forces, at least in
numbers, uncharacteristically broke ranks after firing two
ragged volleys, and surrendered or dispersed.30 His Majesty's

Although His Majesty's [[Indian]] Allies faded from the scene  
along the Detroit front, following the Battle of the Thames,  
what ended in one area, had just begun in another. This second  
front? the [[North]]west? merits some considerable attention,

known, and which could have altered dramatically the future
geographic boundaries of [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]. Again,
His Majesty's [[Indian]] Allies were prominent.
[[British]] paramountcy in the upper Mississippi and the [[North]]
west depended on the military allegiance of the [[Indian]] tribes of
that vast region. The [[British]] and [[Indian]] capture of Michilimac
kinac; and the Potawatomi massacre of Fort Dearborn (Chicago)
in the summer of [[1812]] had "opened the northern hive" of In
dians against the [[America]]ns.32 Equally important, the zealous
activities of the officers of the [[British]] [[Indian]] Department and
several prominent [[Canadian]] fur [[trade]]rs in courting and main
taining the [[alliance]] with the tribes had resulted in a "[[British]]"
domination in the [[North]]west which remained unchallenged
until the late spring of [[1814]].
In [[May]] of that year, an [[America]]n force from St. Louis under
General William Clark, governor of Missouri Territory, ascended
the Mississippi and, meeting only token resistance from the
Sauk and Fox, took possession of Prairie du Chien. After con
structing a stockade which he named Fort Shelby and content
with his success, Clark returned to St. Louis. He left a small
garrison of about seventy men under Lieutenant Joseph Per

village and the new post. The news of the [[America]]n presence in

[[America]]n General from his new conquest, and make him relin  
quish the immense tract of country he had seized upon in conse  
quence and which brought him into the very heart of that oc  
cupied by our friendly [[Indian]]s." Although his own position was  
weak, McDouall was fully cognizant of the critical threat posed

### by the [[America]]ns at Prairie du Chien to [[British]] military

hegemony and [[Canadian]] fur [[trade]] interests in the [[North]]west. If  
the enemy was not removed from the area "there was an end to  
our connection with the [[Indian]]s... tribe after tribe would be  
graned \[sic\] over or subdued, and thus would be destroyed the  
only barrier which protects the [[Great]] trading establishments of  
the [[North]] West and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company."  
In late [[June]], an expedition under Lt. Col. William McKay  
was dispatched to Prairie du Chien. They were joined en route  
by voyageurs, Green [[Bay]] militia, and a horde of [[Indian]]s. McKay

### was singularly unimpressed with the tribal allies and com

mented upon his arrival in front of Fort Shelby that his contin  
gent had swelled to 650 men, of whom 120 were [[Canadian]] Vol  
unteers, Michigan Fencibles, and officers of the [[Indian]] Depart  
ment, the remainder [[Indian]]s who proved to be "perfectly use  
less."35 The small [[America]]n fort containing two blockhouses  
and six pieces of cannon was situated on a hill overlooking the  
village. A large gunboat, the [[Governor]] Clark, was anchored in  
the middle of the Mississippi River. This floating blockhouse,  
[[immune]] from the effects of musket fire, mounted fourteen can  
non and had a crew of eighty men. It was constructed so that  
the men on board could row swiftly in any direction. The unex  
pected appearance of McKay and his mixed force on Sunday, 17  
[[July]], caught the [[America]]ns by surprise. It was a pleasant day  
and the officers were preparing to take a pleasure ride and  
enjoy an outing in the country. After a dramatic exchange of  
notes, Perkins concluded by stating that he preferred to defend  
to the last man rather than surrender. This produced a three  
hour barrage against the fort and gunboat. The [[America]]ns re  
turned the fire. The [[Governor]] Clark, leaking and taking casual  
ties, withdrew down river. For the next two days McKay con

ducted siege operations. Two breastworks were constructed, and  
"a constant but perfectly useless" musket fire was maintained  
against the fort. Some of the [[Indian]]s "behaved in a most villan  
ous manner" and plundered the inhabitants in the village. On  
19 [[July]], McKay "resolved to accomplish something more deci  
sive," and marched his troops into the recently completed works  
and prepared red hot shot for the cannon. The [[America]]ns, see  
ing "that a severe assault of some kind was about to be made,  
raised the [[white]] flag." By the terms of the capitulation, McKay  
took possession of the fort, several pieces of cannon, military  
and camp equipment, and a large quantity of ammunition and  
foodstuffs. The surrendered garrison was permitted to retire un  
molested in boats down river to St. Louis. McKay was pleased  
with the Michigan Fencibles who "behaved with great courage,  
coolness and regularity," and "tho in the midst of a hot fire not  
a man was even wounded." Indeed, purred McKay, "all acted  
with that courage and activity so becoming [[Canadian]] Militia or  
Volunteers."  
Two days after the success at Fort Shelby, the [[Indian]]s, whose  
military prowess had been so recently maligned by McKay, won  
a crushing victory over the [[America]]ns at Rock Island rapids, a  
few miles south of Prairie du Chien. This [[America]]n force of  
about 120 regulars and rangers under the command of Major  
John Campbell, and unaware of the recent developments, was

Shelby. Near the [[Indian]] villages scattered along the banks of
the Rock River, about 400 Sauk, Fox and Kickapoo attacked and
severely mauled the relief column. The [[Indian]]s fought with a
fierce intensity and, desperate to protect their villages and
[[property]], "the women even jumped on board with hoes and some
breaking heads, others breaking casks, some trying to cut holes

decks."37 About fifty [[America]]ns were [[kill]]ed and wounded in the
engagement. Joined by the timely arrival of the [[Governor]]
Clark, Campbell and his remnant made a precipitate retreat to
St. Louis. A jubilant McKay reported that "this is perhaps one
of the most brilliant actions fought by [[Indian]]s only since the
commencement of the war."

### Rapids in [[July]], coupled with the successful defense of

superiority in the [[North]]west. In the Upper Mississippi, McKay  
crowned his success in a symbolic sense by modestly renaming  
Fort Shelby, Fort McKay. He then promptly retired to his quar

His successor at Fort McKay was Captain Thomas Gummer
sall (Tige) Anderson, the commander of the Mississippi Volun
teers. As post commandant, Anderson strengthened Fort McKay
and built a northeast blockhouse. He worried about the poor
harvest that year, and because of the want of provisions, he or
dered the Mississippi Volunteers to help the local farmers in
getting in the grain. The troops were also kept occupied per
forming daily garrison duties. There were few diversions, except
for excessive rum drinking and watching the occasional exciting
spectacle of inter-tribal lacrosse in which several participants
usually "got sore wounds from the ball and the hurl stick."

at Rock Island. The accuracy of the guns under Keating which
was "base enough to knock the Splinters into the men's faces"

a yell and commenced firing on us in every direction," con

villages and [[corn]] fields, and of pushing north to Prairie du  
Chien.40 With the [[Indian]]s in pursuit for nearly three miles, the  
[[America]]ns retreated down river. They had suffered about fifteen  
[[kill]]ed and wounded. [[Indian]] casualties were considered negligi  
ble. At the entrance of the Des Moines River, Taylor built Fort  
Johnson. In [[October]], this last vestige of an [[America]]n presence  
in the upper Mississippi was burned, and the garrison retired to  
St. Louis. No further military efforts were made against Rock  
Island or Prairie du Chien.  
By the late autumn at Fort McKay, rations were becoming  
scarce. To alleviate the food shortage, Anderson discharged the  
Green [[Bay]] militia and sent them home. The remaining troops  
received [[corn]] one day, flour and pork the next. Of greater con  
cern was the increasing number of [[Indian]] families who were  
camping around Prairie du Chien awaiting the arrival of the  
annual supplies from the [[Indian]] Department. These problems  
remained unsolved when Anderson was finally relieved of his  
temporary command on 30 [[November]] [[1814]]. His dedication and  
abilities were proven, and he remained at Fort McKay in local  
command of the .Michigan Fencibles. Andrew Bulger, a [[New]]  
foundlander, took command of Fort McKay on this last day of  
[[November]], his twenty-fifth birthday.41 The situation was both  
dangerous and delicate as the new commandant had inherited  
the twin problems of garrison discontent and tribal irritation at  
the scarcity of provisions. The troops were bored and insolent.  
They were now existing mainly on a scanty allowance of bread  
and a ration of "wild meat" when available. Determined to pre  
serve order, Bulger began to instill a sense of pride and discip  
line in his men. This goal was achieved in early [[January]] [[1815]],

### when he quickly suppressed a near mutiny among the

Michigan Fencibles and flogged the three worst offenders.  
Thereafter the corps assumed a more steadfast military bear  
ing.

In addition, Bulger was instructed to "cultivate a good under  
standing" with the [[Indian]] tribes and maintain their allegiance  
to the [[British]]. Throughout the winter of [[1814]]-15, his duties  
were "as unceasing as they were arduous," and he succeeded in  
gaining the continued affection of the [[Indian]]s by visiting sev  
eral of their villages.43 Unfortunately he also became embroiled  
in a bitter feud with Robert Dickson, Agent and Superintendent  
to the [[Western]] [[Indian]]s, over the control and feeding of the In  
dian allies. Dickson had been prominent in the fur [[trade]] for  
thirty years before the war, and he was the senior officer of the  
[[British]] [[Indian]] Department in the [[North]]west. He was married  
to a Sioux woman and was genuinely concerned at the destitute  
condition of the [[Indian]]s, apart from their military value. Rela  
tions between the two men became increasingly strained over  
specific areas of responsibility. Dickson insisted that supplies to  
the [[Indian]]s must be increased and he showed a bias in feeding  
the Sioux bands. Bulger endeavored "to promote a fair, equal  
and judicious distribution" of provisions and gifts to the [[Indian]]  
families, and he refused to allow the [[Indian]] Department to  
usurp his authority or that of the [[British]] army.44 He reported to  
McDouall that the conduct of Dickson had placed the garrison  
and other western [[Indian]] allies in danger of further starvation.  
The feud became petty and degenerated into name-calling.  
McDouall fully supported Bulger, and in one letter he referred  
to Dickson as that "insidious, intriguing, dangerous, yet despic

### able character."45 This nastiness was terminated when

McDouall finally ordered that "the [[Indian]] Department on the  
Mississippi is subject to and entirely under the orders of Cap

### tain Bulger."46 In [[April]] [[1815]] Dickson was ordered to

Michilimackinac. This whole episode, coupled with the boredom  
and isolation of Prairie du Chien, so disgusted Duncan Graham  
that "was there not favourable appearances to the termination  
of this drudgery," he reckoned that "he would throw up in  
stantly." The disconsolate Graham proved prophetic when he

Here we are posted since last fall, without news from any

In fact official news of peace reached Prairie du Chien in the  
late spring of [[1815]]. Strong war-parties to threaten St. Louis,  
and "keep the [[America]]ns at home to defend that place" had al  
ready been dispatched. In these raids the [[Indian]]s "took more  
scalps within the last six weeks than they did during the whole  
of the preceding spring and summer upon this frontier."48  
Bulger immediately recalled the [[warrior]]s. As the basis of the  
peace [[treaty]] was status quo ante bellum, the "mutual restora

McDouall was "penetrated with grief at the restoration of this  
fine Island, a fortress built by Nature for herself." He was  
"equally mortified at giving up Fort McKay to the [[America]]ns,"  
but there was no alternative but compliance. The crestfallen

In the [[North]]west, the [[War]] of [[1812]] was a very different matter  
than the one played out along the Detroit. When the [[United]]  
[[States]] went to war in [[June]] [[1812]] to redress national honor and  
capture [[Canada]], an early territorial ambition which anticipated  
the [[America]]n vision of manifest destiny for the continent, the  
key consideration for Upper [[Canada]] was defense. The concept of  
'Manifest Destiny,' replete with spiritual and religious connota  
tions, was used by the [[United]] [[States]] to justify that westward  
sweeping movement in which successive [[Indian]] frontiers were

### [[conquer]]ed and pacified. It was God's will, apparently, that

[[America]]ns must dominate and control [[North]] [[America]]. The sug  
gestion that the [[United]] [[States]] usurped a large part of the conti  
nent by purchase, war and theft, is too harsh. But, an argument

### could be made that the zealous young republic dispossessed

tribe after tribe during the long epic years of 'Westward Ho;'  
and it did so by taking thousands upon thousands of hectares or  
acres of unceded [[Indian]] lands, to which no consideration, recog  
nition nor acknowledgement was given that these [[indigenous]]  
peoples might have at least the benefit of the right of prior oc  
cupancy or [[aboriginal]] title, as they had enjoyed the use and oc  
cupancy of their lands since time immemorial.  
Manifest Destiny proved most successful for the expansionist  
ambitions of the [[United]] [[States]], except, of course, in the case of  
[[Canada]] during the [[War]] of [[1812]]. The failure to take [[Canada]] was  
a rare exception through these many years in which [[America]]n  
destiny did not manifest. Yet [[America]]ns were mollified, for they  
did win the [[Indian]] war in the [[War]] of [[1812]], as Tecumseh's Con  
federacy was irretrievably crushed and the [[Great]] Lakes [[Indian]]  
frontier secured. But the [[War]] of [[1812]] also provided the pros  
pects for a little [[Canadian]] manifest destiny. In the [[North]]west, a  
number of prominent [[Canadian]] fur [[trade]]rs, supported by the  
[[Indian]] tribes of the upper [[Great]] Lakes and Mississippi Valley,  
also viewed, in their way, the [[War]] of [[1812]] as an opportunity to  
grasp and consolidate territory. For these two groups, the war  
became a common struggle to achieve a possible permanent  
[[British]] hegemony in that hinterland and thus preserve the fur  
[[trade]] and the traditional [[Indian]] way of life against [[America]]n

The post-[[1815]] years indeed produced an "Era of Good Feel

councils took place at Fort McKay, Amherstburg, Drummond Is

the reaction of [[Native]] peoples throughout the [[North]]west. Cer  
tainly, a dramatic and permanent shift in [[British]] [[Indian]] policy  
was unfolding. Indeed, the old glorious days of military "pomp  
and ceremony" were irretrievably lost. In a few years new strat  
egy would evolve to civilize and Christianize the [[Native]] peoples  
residing in [[Canada]], by "collecting them in villages (reserves),"  
and inducing them to cultivate the land. As well, education and  
religious instruction would be provided for the [[Indian]] [[child]]ren,

Throughout the long period of [[British]]-[[Indian]] military al
liances, the [[Native]] peoples had been caught in the grip of two
forces, an [[empire]] and a frontier, neither of which was particu

### tached themselves to the [[British]] in each fight against the

[[America]]ns, as the [[Native]] peoples tried to salvage some remnants  
of their traditional lands and cultural values, as the original  
people. In the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[warrior]]s lashed out in one final  
desperate defense of the old order. But, from the beginning of  
contact, [[Native]] peoples in [[America]] and [[Canada]] could only delay  
or retard, but not stem, the tide of these technologically dominant  
and ever intruding newcomers. The [[Indian]] struggle was made  
even more difficult by rampant tribal factionalism which (then as  
now) broke the spirit of [[Indian]] unity and harmony; and made the  
pretense of the existence of an [[Indian]] state or homeland, the  
merest of fictions. A final [[death]]blow for [[Indian]] interests was that  
in the grand theater of international diplomacy, [[Native]] peoples  
were considered expendable. By the end of the [[War]] of [[1812]], His  
Majesty's [[Indian]] Allies were no longer needed nor desired by the

### [[British]] in [[Canada]]. Nonetheless, [[Native]] peoples retained an

```
affection and loyalty to the [[British]] [[Crown]]. This continued
attachment stemmed in part from periodic bouts of [[British]] fairness
```

### and justice toward them, as best evidenced by the Royal

```
Proclamation of [[1763]] in which the crown established a formal
procedure for purchasing the [[Indian]] interest in their traditional
lands; and to the fact that the [[warrior]]s and [[British]] soldiers had
fought side by side over many years, as friends and comrades-in
arms. Yet, during a lengthy summer council in [[1818]], a sage old
chief rose and addressed the assembled. He knew full well that
all was lost for his generation, and concluded the speech to [[British]]
[[Crown]] officials with a simple truth:
You are very kind when you want us to fight for you but
when that Service is performed, "the Store door be shut against
