"Welcome In, But Check Your Rights at

the Door": The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a
Agreements in [[Canada]]'

PAUL RYNARD York University

1. Introduction

The signing of the Nisga'a Final Agreement in [[August]] of 1[[998]] was an

event of singular importance in the [[history]] of "First Nations
relations"2 in [[Canada]]. It marked the completion of the first [[treaty]]
negotiations in [[British]] Columbia in the twentieth century and will
soon be followed by many others as nearly province-wide negotiations

redefine the relationship between First Nations, the province and
[[Canada]]. Given a political [[climate]] hostile to [[Aboriginal]] rights, the
[[treaty]] is a significant achievement and deserves the support of fair-

minded [[Canadian]]s. It certainly does not "give too much" to the
Nisga'a Nation as its critics in the Liberal and Reform parties of

[[British]] Columbia frequently assert.3
Yet the goal of this article is to show that the federal and provin-

cial [[government]]s must do better: the content of the Nisga'a [[treaty]]
shows that [[government]]s in [[Canada]] are not yet ready to embrace fully

1 I am very much indebted to conversations with Brian Craik, Ken Gilpin, Kent
McNeil, Alan Penn, Michael Posluns, Peter Russell and Michelle Sweet. This
article is revised from a version presented to the annual meeting of the [[Canadian]]
Political [[Science]] Association, Sherbrooke, [[1999]].
2 I owe this phrase to Michael Posluns who uses it to distinguish a complex relationship with First Nations from [[government]]-imposed "[[Indian]] policy."
3 This article does not answer the [[treaty]]'s critics, but see Hamar Foster, "Honouring the [[Queen]]'s Flag: A Legal and Historical Perspective on the Nisga'a [[Treaty]],"

BC Studies 120 (1[[998]]/[[1999]]), 11-36; 27-33. He argues convincingly that the

[[treaty]] does not alter the constitution nor create a "race"-based [[government]].

Abstract. The Nisga'a [[treaty]] is only the second so-called comprehensive land claim
ever settled in a province in [[Canada]]. Through a comparison to the first, the James [[Bay]]
Agreement, this article evaluates how much progress has been made in [[Canada]] in the
recognition of [[Aboriginal]] land rights. While the Nisga'a [[treaty]] is innovative and deserves
support, it is argued here that provincial and federal [[government]]s must adopt a far less
restrictive approach to [[Aboriginal]] land rights than the one taken in the James [[Bay]] and
Nisga'a agreements. In particular, the Nisga'a [[treaty]]'s redefining and limiting of [[Aboriginal]] title is too close to the old policy of requiring that [[treaties]] extinguish funda[[mental]]
rights, suggesting that [[government]]s in [[Canada]] are not yet ready to affirm fully the distinctiveness of First Nations.

Resume. Le trait6 Nisga'a est la second entente portant sur la revendication d'un vaste
territoire ' avoir jamais 6t6 concolue par une province du [[Canada]]. En se fondant sur une

comparaison de cette entente et de la premiere, c'est-?-dire la Convention de la Baie

James, cet article 6value les progres r6alis6s, au [[Canada]], en matiere de reconnaissance
des droits territoriaux des autochtones. L'argumentation centrale de l'auteur est que si le
traits Nisga'a est innovateur et merite d'etre appuy6, il faudrait que les gouvernements
provinciaux et f6d6raux adoptent, dans le futur, une approche des revendications territo-

riales des aborigenes beaucoup moins restrictive que celles du Traits Nisga'a et de la
Convention de la Baie James. Il insiste notamment sur le fait que les dispositions du
Trait6 Nisga'a, qui red6finissent et limitent le titre des autochtones, sont beaucoup trop

proches de l'ancienne politique qui faisait des trait6s un instrument d'extinction des

droits fondamentaux des autochtones, ce qui tend " d6montrer que les gouvernements du

[[Canada]] ne sont pas encore prets a reconnaitre pleinement la sp6cificit6 des [[Premier]]es

Nations.

The RCAP report emphasizes [[treaty]] making and [[treaty]] renewal as [[corn]]erstones of a new relationship with [[Aboriginal]] peoples, and it provides guidelines for new [[treaty]] processes. The most relevant compo-

nents of the model offered include the negotiation of new [[treaties]]
without [[government]]s requiring that the [[Aboriginal]] party surrender or
extinguish its rights and title; that an independent and empowered tribunal oversee negotiations and implementation; and that the negotiators aim for a three-part division of the traditional territories involved,
with [[Aboriginal]] nations having significant jurisdiction in two of the
three land categories.

This comparison is necessarily selective and will focus on
land and resource rights, thus little will be said here about some of the
most important and ground-breaking elements of the Nisga'a [[treaty]]:
its governance and financing provisions. A table summarizing the two
agreements is provided at the end. Also, while I make some attempt to
keep the poor record of JBA implementation in mind here, a proper

account of that [[history]] cannot be included.8 This article does not

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 215
Perhaps the most important point in this brief [[history]] is that the
period from the [[1885]] M6tis Rebellion until [[1951]] was marked by the
repression of [[Indian]] legal and political struggle and organizing. Prohibitions in the federal [[Indian]] Act against the Potlatch were sometimes
used to prevent meetings to discuss land issues, and to make a united
[[Indian]] front difficult. From [[1927]] to [[1951]], in reaction against [[Indian]]

legal and political activism, the [[Indian]] Act contained clause 149A,

which made it an offence for [[Indian]]s or Band councils to raise, from
their peoples, the money needed to hire lawyers and to press claims.1"
Given this [[history]] of repression, the contemporary meaning and content of equality, and of obligations owed, are drastically complicated at
the very least: present socio-economic, cultural and intellectual conditions are rooted in this [[history]] meaning that notions of simple formal
equality ignore this reality and deny a shared colonial past.12 Current
policies and agreements do not recognize any obligations arising from
past repression.
More recently, the legal struggles of the Nisga'a chiefs and the
[[Cree]]s east of James [[Bay]] would prove decisive in forcing the issue of
[[Aboriginal]] title onto the federal policy agenda.'3 In [[1967]], the Nisga'a
Tribal Council chiefs began their [[battle]] in the courts for legal recognition of their land rights, for which they had been struggling in the

political arena since the [[1880]]s. In [[November]] [[1971]], their case, now

well known as the Calder case, made it to the Supreme Court of Cana-

da. That same year, [[Premier]] Robert Bourassa announced the James
[[Bay]] project-a massive hydro-electric development in northern [[Quebec]]. After being ignored and then rebuffed by Bourassa, the [[Cree]]s,
joined by the Inuit of the Ungava region, initiated legal proceedings
against [[Quebec]] and the James [[Bay]] project in [[November]] [[1972]]. But a

decision in the Calder case came first, in [[February]] [[1973]], a ruling
University of [[British]] Columbia Press, [[1990]]), 89-103. See, also, Christopher
Mckee, [[Treaty]] Talks in [[British]] Columbia: Negotiating a Mutually Beneficial
Future ([[Vancouver]]: University of [[British]] Columbia Press, [[1996]]); and Nisga'a
Tribal Council, Nisga'a: People of the Nass River ([[Vancouver]]: Douglas and
McIntyre, [[1993]]).

11 Tennant, [[Aboriginal]] Peoples and Politics, 96-113. See also, George Manuel and
Michael Posluns, The Fourth World: An [[Indian]] Reality (Don Mills: CollierMacmillan, [[1974]]), 87-95; and John Leslie and Ron Macguire, eds., The Historical Development of the [[Indian]] Act (2nd ed.; [[Ottawa]]: Department of [[Indian]] and
[[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]], [[1984]]), 120.

12 "This is interesting ... once you devastate a people and make them unequal, you
then promise equality. Is this justice" (Raven in John Borrows, "Re-Living the
Present: Title, Treaties and the Trickster in [[British]] Columbia," BC Studies 120
[1[[998]]/[[1999]]], 104). Recognizing the [[history]] of repression exposes the deception,
or ignorance, behind the idea that First Nations' "claims" are a new creation.
13 After [[1951]] the prohibitions on traditional ceremonies and raising funds for claims
were dropped, but it was not until [[1973]] that some progress on land issues resulted.

tions in the province. The Nisga'a Final Agreement was signed in
[[August]] 1[[998]], and was ratified by the BC Legislative Assembly in
[[April]] [[1999]] and by Parliament in [[April]] [[2000]].16

3. General Provisions: Extinguishing Rights?
James [[Bay]]

When considering [[treaty]] provisions it must be recalled that the [[Aboriginal]] side has hardly bargained from a position of strength. In James
[[Bay]], for example, the details of the agreement eventually reached were
determined after two important losses in the courts following the ini-

tial victory which had moved the province into talking." Overall,
duress and inequality characterized the negotiations, particularly since

[[Aboriginal]] rights had no constitutional protection before [[1982]] and
were only beginning to be taken seriously by the courts.'8
The James [[Bay]] Agreement borrowed from the numbered [[treaties]]
of the nineteenth century in its [[treatment]] of [[Aboriginal]] title. The text

states that:

In consideration of the rights and benefits herein set forth in favour of
the James [[Bay]] [[Cree]]s and the Inuit of [[Quebec]], the James [[Bay]] [[Cree]]s and
the Inuit of [[Quebec]] hereby cede, release, surrender and convey all their
[[Native]] claims, rights, titles and interests, whatever they may be, in and
to land in the territory and in [[Quebec]], and [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]] accept
such surrender.... [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]], the James [[Bay]] Energy Corpo-

ration, the James [[Bay]] Development Corporation and the [[Quebec]]
Hydro-Electric Commission (Hydro-[[Quebec]]), to the extent of their
respective obligations as set forth herein, hereby give, grant, recognize
and provide to the James [[Bay]] [[Cree]]s and the Inuit of [[Quebec]] the rights,
privileges and benefits specified herein, the whole in consideration of

the said cession, release, surrender and conveyance .... 19

16 There is a useful chronology of events in McKee, [[Treaty]] Talks, 101-06.

17 I. E. LaRusic, A. Penn and S. Bouchard, Negotiating a Way of Life ([[Ottawa]]:
Department of [[Indian]] Affairs and [[North]]ern Development, [[1979]]).

18 See Grand Council of the [[Cree]]s (of [[Quebec]]), Sovereign Injustice: Forcible Inclusion of the James [[Bay]] [[Cree]]s and [[Cree]] Territory into a Sovereign [[Quebec]]
(Nemaska: Eeyou Astchee, [[1995]]), 252-54. At one point there was a threatened
cut-off of the [[Cree]]s' negotiating funds and the most drastic provisions, such as
the extinguishment of [[Aboriginal]] title, were said to be nonnegotiable. Even without an agreement, extinguishment was possible through legislation without [[Cree]]
consent at the time. The JBA was also negotiated without the benefit of modern
precedents and under pressures of tight deadlines.
19 JBA 2.1, 2.2 (I use the following referencing system: for the JBA the designation
24.6.2, for example, refers to section 24, provision 6, "subprovision" 2. For the
NFA, 8.89(b), for example, means chapter 8, paragraph 89, point b).

21 It is misleading to say that the [[Yukon]] agreements, for example, retain [[Aboriginal]]
title: see provision 2.5 of Umbrella Final Agreement between the Government of

[[Canada]], the Council for [[Yukon]] [[Indian]]s and the Government of the [[Yukon]]

([[Ottawa]]: Minister of Supply and Services, [[1993]]). A useful guide to the [[Yukon]]
provisions can be found in Michael Jackson, "A [[New]] Covenant Chain: An Alternative Model to Extinguishment for Land Claims Agreements," [[research]] report
prepared for the RCAP, [[October]] [[1995]], on the CD-ROM, RCAP, "For Seven Generations." The [[treaty]] on which the territory of [[Nunavut]] is based applies the formula and key terms of the JBA and the nineteenth-century [[treaties]] (see 2.7.1 of
[[Indian]] and [[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]], Agreement between the Inuit of the [[Nunavut]]
Settlement Area and Her Majesty the [[Queen]] in Right of [[Canada]] [[[Ottawa]]: [[Indian]]
and [[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]], [[1993]]]).

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 219
The Nisga 'a Agreement
Unfortunately the "General Provisions" chapter of the NFA contains a
set of clauses which accomplish all the goals of the old policy: they
provide federal and provincial [[government]]s, and private corporations,
with a guarantee that they will not have to revisit the issue of [[Aboriginal]] title in the future. Although subject to the terms of the [[treaty]],

crown ownership and [[sovereignty]] is secured in an exchange for

defined and enforceable [[treaty]] rights. Consider 2.22:
This Agreement constitutes the full and final settlement in respect of

the [[aboriginal]] rights, including [[aboriginal]] title, in [[Canada]] of the
Nisga'a Nation.
But also note the next paragraph, 2.23:
This Agreement exhaustively sets out Nisga'a section 35 rights, the
geographic extent of those rights, and the limitations to those rights, to
which the Parties have agreed, and those rights are:
a. the [[aboriginal]] rights, including [[aboriginal]] title, as modified by this

Agreement, in [[Canada]] of the Nisga'a Nation and its people in and to
Nisga'a Lands and other lands and resources in [[Canada]];
b. the jurisdictions, authorities, and the rights of Nisga'a Government;

and

c. the other Nisga'a section 35 rights. (Emphasis added)

The phrases "exhaustively" and "as modified by this agreement" seem
to be attempts at ensuring that no court will ever rule in favour of the
Nisga'a Nation on any basis other than a violation of the specific terms
of the [[treaty]]-however much future generations might be prepared to reassess the terms of co-existence.23

To secure further the [[treaty]]'s delineation of Nisga' a rights the old

language of "releasing" rights is retained to deal with possible reassertions of [[Aboriginal]] title-although the terms "cede" and "sur-

render" are not used:

If, despite this Agreement and the settlement legislation, the Nisga'a
Nation has an [[aboriginal]] right, including [[aboriginal]] title, in [[Canada]], that is

other than, or different in attributes or geographical extent from, the
Nisga'a section 35 rights as set out in this Agreement, the Nisga'a Nation
releases24that [[aboriginal]] right to [[Canada]] to the extent that the [[aboriginal]] right is other than, or different in attributes or geographical extent
from, the Nisga'a section 35 rights as set out in this Agreement.25

23 On the other hand the [[treaty]] does provide for amendment if all parties agree.

24 "Release": "a gift, discharge, or renunciation of a right of action; also a common law conveyance of a larger estate" (John Burke, Jowitt's Dictionary of
English Law, Vol. 2 [2nd ed.; London: Sweet and Maxwell, [[1977]]], [[1531]]).
25 NFA 2.26 (emphasis added). See also 2.27 and 2.31.

tinues" only as the fee simple Nisga'a lands, and is explicitly released
everywhere else, in the bulk of the traditionally held lands.29

Finally, since [[Aboriginal]] rights are "recognized and affirmed" by
section 35 of the Constitution Act, [[1982]] it is impossible to extinguish
those rights with unilateral legislation. So the NFA's assertion that
Nisga'a title is being "continued as modified" is significant because it
obscures the fact that the [[treaty]] (when combined with the ratification
legislation) involves an explicit release, and a statutory renunciation,
of constitutionally protected common law rights, to the extent that
such rights might be shown to be different in content or geographic
reach from the NFA's definition. It is, therefore, unlikely that a court
will view the NFA, complete with Nisga'a consent, as constituting an
illegitimate extinguishment of section 35 rights. Moreover, there are
grounds for disputing the extent to which Nisga'a consent can be said
to have been freely given if all the inequities in land claims policy are

taken into account.30

Overall, a concern for legal and political certainty has subordinated questions of fairness, flexibility and historical redress in the

NFA. The agreement is remarkably close to the 23-year-old James
[[Bay]] Agreement insofar as Nisga'a land rights and ties to their lands
are limited and frozen. However, the full implications of the extinguishment/certainty provisions can only be discussed when other landrelated provisions are considered.
29 NFA 2.25. The federal ratification legislation reiterates that Nisga'a [[Aboriginal]] title
is changed to fee simple title on Nisga'a lands and is released elsewhere, just as it is
clear that some Nisga'a common law rights are being released (paragraph 7 of the
legislation, which reproduces 2.24 and 2.25 of agreement, also confirms that the
new [[treaty]] rights are "an express derogation from the common law"); see [[Canada]],
House of Commons, An Act to Give Effect to the Nisga'a Final Agreement, Bill
C-9, [[December]] 13, [[1999]] (www.parl.gc.ca/cgi-bin/36/pb_gob.pl?e). Ratification legislation makes the agreement binding on third parties and allows for the appropriation of funds. Given the Orwellian way [[treaty]] texts try simultaneously to recognize and extinguish rights, however, the fact that the NFA ties Nisga'a land rights
to precontact inherent rights, by claiming a continuation of rights, might prove

important in litigation or negotiation. The NFA preamble also states that the
Nisga'a people have lived in the Nass area since time immemorial.
30 See John Olthuis and H. W. R. Townshend, "Is [[Canada]]'s Thumb on the Scales?
An Analysis of [[Canada]]'s Comprehensive and Specific Claims Policies and Suggested Alternatives," [[research]] report prepared for the RCAP, [[November]] [[1995]], on

the CD-ROM, RCAP, "For Seven Generations." Since [[government]]s and courts
do not question the validity of underlying crown title and [[sovereignty]], the gov-

ernment side in negotiations already has its central claims recognized. This
results in little pressure to negotiate, whereas the [[Aboriginal]] party faces an ongo-

ing denial of rights so long as there is no [[treaty]]. The Nisga'a bargaining position
was also weakened by the fragility of support for a [[treaty]] process, particularly
given the hostility of the opposition parties in BC, from which the next provincial
[[government]] might be formed.

Category I lands are more under [[Cree]] control, although even here
[[Quebec]] holds the subsurface (mineral, oil and gas) rights.32 On these
small parcels of land [[Cree]] band councils can pass by-laws and, for the

most part, control development. The [[Cree]]s also have exclusive fish
and wildlife harvesting rights. They also hold the forestry rights. But
in commercial terms these rights alone are of limited value given the
relatively unproductive and marginal nature of small tracts of northern
forests. In contrast, the forestry industry annually extracts about $1.2
billion worth of trees from Eeyou Istchee, all from the much larger
tracts of land provincially granted as timber concessions in Categories

II and III.

Category I lands are further subdivided into I.A and I.B. All the
[[Cree]] communities are in Category I.A lands, which are under federal
jurisdiction as is the case with other [[Indian]] reserves. This strong fed31 See Penn, "The James [[Bay]] Agreement."
32 See JBA 5.1.2, 5.1.10. [[Cree]] consent is required for mineral extraction from Category I lands, and compensation would be payable. Subsequent [[treaties]] have all
confirmed some degree of [[Aboriginal]] subsurface ownership.

eral role gives the James [[Bay]] Agreement regime an important tripartite structure. Category I.B lands are very small and are a curious creation which the [[Cree]] communities control through incorporation into
the [[Quebec]] system of municipalities, even though there are no settlements there. However, [[Cree]] Category I lands (A+B) total only 5,600

km2, or about 1.5 per cent of the land which the [[Cree]]s use, as they
always have, as their material and cultural base.33 In short, the [[Cree]]s
have lost ownership rights to most of the natural resources of their
lands and have had their in[[flu]]ence over development activities confined to advisory committees, an in[[flu]]ence that, in practice, has not
been significant.

Nisga 'a Lands
The Nisga'a [[treaty]] contains a very different land regime. The details
are complex since there are different types of Nisga'a-owned land,
including a designation for 56 former [[Indian]] reserves. Yet the basic
structure is straightforward, consisting of 1,992 km2 on both sides of
the lower Nass River to about 100 km upriver. This is called "Nisga'a
Lands" and is fully and collectively owned by the Nisga'a Nation. The
four villages which have local governance arrangements based on the
agreement are within the boundaries of Nisga'a lands.
Nisga'a lands are held by fee simple title, the largest estate in the
[[Canadian]] legal system. Significantly, this title includes resource ownership, including mineral, oil, gas and forestry rights.34 But fee simple
title means that the relationship of the Nisga'a people to their lands is
now formally defined by the legal system of the dominant society, and
in some cases laws of general application can affect the Nisga'as just
as other [[property]] holders are affected.35 However, other fee simple title

33 In contrast, about 10,500 km2 have been flooded by the La Grande hydro development alone! Moreover, the [[Cree]]s had very little effective choice in which lands
could be claimed as Category I or II since the province asserted its priorities of,
and existing plans for, hydro-electric and natural resource development. In fact,
the energy and development crown corporations were direct parties to the negoti-

ations.

34 NFA 3.19. Isolated pockets of "third party" fee simple holdings within Nisga'a
lands are not altered by the agreement, just as the Nisga'a ownership of the
forests does not mean an immediate end to timber concessions already granted.
Two large parks are also excluded even though they are largely surrounded by
Nisga'a Lands.

35 The status of Nisga'a lands may be more complex than I have allowed. The

[[treaty]]'s attempt, at NFA 2.10, to exclude Nisga'a lands from 91(24) of the Constitution Act, [[1867]] (which "gives" jurisdiction over [[Indian]]s and [[Indian]] lands to
the federal [[government]]) may not stand up if challenged in court: the [[treaty]] does
not (and could not) alter 91(24), while it does confirm that the Nisga'a people are
[[Aboriginal]] peoples, meaning that their lands might still be "lands reserved for
the [[Indian]]s" (based on conversation with Kent McNeil).

37 Nisga'a and federal [[government]] information puts the Nisga'a traditional territories at about 24,000 km2. Sterritt suggests that evidence supports a figure of only
7,800 km2 (Neil Sterritt, "The Nisga'a [[Treaty]]: Competing Claims Ignored!" BC
Studies 120 [1[[998]]/[[1999]]], 73-98). However, in downplaying the significance of
overlaps Sterritt's calculation is too low.
38 The current Nisga'a population is roughly equivalent to the [[Cree]] population east
of James [[Bay]] in [[1975]], at about 5,000-6,000, although many Nisga'as do not live
in the Nass valley.

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 225
The [[Cree]]s retained about 1.5 per cent of their territory as Category I
lands under their control, while the Nisga'as will have between 10 and
25 per cent of their traditional territory.

Most importantly, the NFA confirms the Nisga'a Nation's ownership of minerals, forests and a percentage of the fishery, along with the

jurisdiction to manage and benefit from these resources (although
much of the good timber has already been taken39). However, it will
take many years for the adequacy of the land base to be known. The
loss of most of the traditional territories, combined with the goal of
reducing Nisga'a fiscal dependence on the federal and provincial [[government]]s, will create enormous pressures to exploit the resources of
Nisga'a lands in ways which may be ecologically unsustainable given
market imperatives.40

Harvesting Rights and Wildlife Management in James [[Bay]]
Section 24 of the JBA outlines [[Cree]] rights to harvest wildlife and it is

in many ways groundbreaking. There are exclusive [[Cree]] rights to
some species in the whole territory along with exclusive rights to all
hunting, trapping and fishing in Categories I and II lands. But there is
also an explicit priority to the [[Cree]] harvest: "The principle of priority
of [[Native]] harvesting shall mean that in conformity with the principle
of conservation and where game populations permit, the [[Native]] people

39 Intensive logging of the forests along the Nass River has been ongoing since the
[[1950]]s, and probably over $2 billion worth of timber has been removed. In addition, alongside commercial fishing, an estimated 68 million grams of [[gold]] and
2,268 million grams of [[silver]] have been taken from Nisga'a lands (Nisga'a Tribal

Council, "Nisga'a: People of the Mighty River" [[[New]] Aiyanish, BC: [[1992]]]).

The NFA clearly stipulates that none of this wealth can be recovered as damages

for past violations of [[Aboriginal]] title (NFA 2.30). Moreover, according to the
Supreme Court's definition of [[Aboriginal]] title, the Nisga'a Nation owns its lands
and resources, even without a [[treaty]], subject to proof of occupation at the time

[[British]] [[sovereignty]] was asserted. Yet cost estimates always claim that the
Nisga'as are being "given" millions in lands and resources. Taken together, the
lands and resources gained by BC, and the resources already exploited, mean that
the NFA is an enormous saving for BC and [[Canada]]. In the case of the JBA, the
province and federal [[government]] gained access to tax revenues from what is now
about $5 billion worth of electricity and $1.2 billion worth of logging annually.
Finally, all settlements result in large sums of federal money flowing into local

economies.

40 Most of the [[treaty]]'s critics are caught in a contradiction when they argue that the
Nisga' a Nation will have too much land and will be too reliant on fiscal transfers:

the only plausible ways of reducing financial dependence are to increase the

amount of traditional territory retained by [[treaty]], or through shared resource own-

ership and royalty arrangements (which the NFA does not contain). Compare

(1[[998]]/[[1999]]), 55-72.

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 227
Several committees and procedures are established to accomplish
these goals, the main one giving the [[Cree]]s input into environ[[mental]]
protection being the James [[Bay]] Advisory Committee on the Environment (JBACE), which oversees the implementation of environ[[mental]]
impact procedures and reviews policy on a regular basis. It has equal
[[Cree]] and [[government]] representation, although its decisions are not
binding on the federal and provincial [[government]]s. Environ[[mental]]
impact assessment of particular projects is conducted by committees
on which [[Cree]] [[representative]]s sit with federal or provincial counterparts, depending on whether or not federal jurisdiction is relevant to

the land or land use affected.

In spite of the advisory nature of the [[Cree]] input the environ[[mental]] provisions are strengthened significantly by their interdependence
with the harvesting rights: "The rights and guarantees of the [[Native]]

people established by and in accordance with this Section shall be
guaranteed, protected and given effect to with respect to environmen-

tal and social protection by and in accordance with Section 22." In
other words, the agreement, or at least parts of it, is set up so that the

[[Cree]]s will be able to in[[flu]]ence decisions about the pace, nature and
destructiveness of the development of almost all their traditional
lands.44

Nisga 'a Wildlife Harvesting

On Nisga'a lands and in the Nass Wildlife Area, the Nisga'a Nation
has collective entitlement to a percentage allocation of wildlife for
hunting and inland fishing, including specific mention of the communal nature (no individual licence fees, for example) and traditional seasons of Nisga'a hunting and gathering. For moose, mountain goats and
grizzly bears, the percentage of the allowable harvest for the area is set

in the [[treaty]]-for example, the Nisga'as are allocated 25 per cent of
the allowable hunt for mountain goats. The province has ultimate
responsibility for wildlife management, and the [[treaty]] stipulates that
Nisga'a hunting is subject to conservation and public safety, although
Nisga'a allocations cannot be altered.45

44 JBA 24.11.1. The preamble to the federal legislation giving effect to the JBA
states that: "AND WHEREAS the Agreement provides... [for] the establishment in the Territory of regional and local [[government]]s to ensure the full and
active participation of the [[Cree]]s and Inuit in the administration of the
Territory... [and for] the establishment of laws, regulations and procedures to
manage and protect the environment in the Territory" (James [[Bay]] and [[North]]ern

[[Quebec]] [[Native]] Claims Settlement Act, S.C. [[1976]]-77, chap. 32, Carswell Consolidated [[Native]] Law Statutes [[[1994]]], 279).

PAUL

RYNARD

But because the Nass Wildlife Area is crown land it is the

province which is solely responsible for disposing of parcels of th

land as it sees fit, including authorizing various uses and tenu

There is a clause which states that such authorizations must not

"reduce Nisga'a wildlife allocations,"46 though there is no elaboratio
as to how this requirement might be enforced in the case of a disput

over proposed development. Moreover, the Nisga'a entitlements a
percentages, not specified amounts, which means that a crown land
use which destroyed extensive habitat and reduced wildlife popu
tions would likely be unaffected by the stipulation to protect Nisga
allocations. In fact, the agreement stipulates that "Notwithstanding
that Nisga'a wildlife entitlements are [[treaty]] rights, a Nisga'a wildli
allocation that is set out as a percentage of the total allowable harve
has the same priority as the recreational and commercial harvest of t
total allowable harvest of that species." Similarly, the criteria to guid
the responsible provincial minister in considering committee advice

refers to both Nisga'a wishes and "the utilization of the wildli

resources for the benefit of all [[Canadian]]s."47

The role of the Nisga'a Nation in wildlife management is strictly
participatory and advisory rather than binding and authoritative: the
provincial minister is required only to consider recommendations from
the Wildlife Committee, which comprises equivalent Nisga'a/provincial representation, and if a consensus is not reached each party's rep-

resentatives can submit their own recommendations. The committee

works on conservation and on annual management plans. The Nisga'a
[[government]] does have authority and jurisdiction in the Nass Wildlife
Area-the bulk of Nisga'a traditional lands-in regulating the hunting
and gathering activities of Nisga'a citizens, although within the context of the preponderance of the provincially approved annual management plans.48

Environ[[mental]] Protection, NFA
Chapter 10 of the NFA does give the Nisga'a [[government]] a primary role
in the environ[[mental]] assessment of projects on Nisga'a lands. One progressive provision requires that assessment processes "assess the effects
of the project on the existing and future economic, social and cultural
well-being of Nisga'a citizens who may be affected by the project."49

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga 'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 229
However, the chapter is also unequivocal that federal or provincial
laws will prevail whenever there is conflict with Nisga'a law, as might
be the case with actual regulation and enforcement. There is, then, no
guarantee that the Nisga'a [[government]] will be able to enforce tougher
environ[[mental]] protection standards if it wants to.50

Perhaps the most striking thing when compared to the JBA is the
lack of a substantial Nisga'a role in environ[[mental]] assessment in the
Nass Wildlife Area and all other areas outside the core Nisga'a lands.
There is only provision for consultation and participation in an assessment process by the Nisga'a Nation if a project outside Nisga'a lands

"may reasonably be expected to have adverse" effects on Nisga'a

lands or interests.51 Moreover, "interests" is not defined, and the harvesting rights in the Nass Wildlife Area are not explicitly defined as
interests, so it is unlikely that there is a binding obligation to involve
the Nisga'a Nation in assessments of projects which may harm harvesting rights outside Nisga'a lands. Certainly there is nothing even
close to a Nisga'a veto over any development projects beyond the new
borders of Nisga'a lands. While the [[Cree]]s do not have a formal veto,
the JBA, on paper at least, does give them a participatory role in the
environ[[mental]] management (not merely assessments) of almost all of

their traditional lands.
Fisheries

The James [[Bay]] Agreement states that [[Cree]] beneficiaries have the right
to sell fish from Category I and II lands, as well as those fish to which
they have exclusive rights in Category III lands. There is even a muchneglected provision requiring federal [[government]] funding and assistance
to [[Cree]] commercial fishing operations.52 Although small commercial
fisheries operate in the region, there is nothing like the economic poten-

tial of the Nass River salmon runs in James [[Bay]]. Accordingly, the fisheries provisions of the NFA are much more important and prominent.
Yet the JBA's affirmation of exclusive [[Cree]] subsistence and commer-

cial fishing rights in an area of about 70,000 km2 provides evidence
for the argument that there was far less progress in First Nations rela-

tions over the last two decades than is often assumed.

Nonetheless, an established non-[[Aboriginal]] fishery for Nass
salmon makes the NFA fisheries chapter a significant achievement. It

relax its environ[[mental]] standards in the Nass Area for the purpose of providing
an encouragement to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, or retention of an
investment." But it is not clear if this clause is enforceable given its lack of elaboration of criteria or procedures.

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 231
been respected; and there have been protracted struggles over hydro-

electric developments. In the case of the James [[Bay]] II project, for
example, federal and provincial [[representative]]s agreed to bypass the
JBA procedures, without [[Cree]] consent, and, once again, only a court

case was able to make the agreement relevant.56 And in [[December]]
[[1999]] the Superior Court of [[Quebec]] ruled that the province had been
regulating the forestry industry in violation of the JBA, effectively
endorsing years of [[Cree]] [[protest]] about the destructive nature of forestry

in Eeyou Istchee.57
Similarly, the main instrument for sharing input into public policies regulating resource use, the JBACE, has not been effective since

the federal and provincial [[government]]s have not put significant
resources or effort into making it work. In fact, the committee has
barely functioned, since the federal and provincial [[representative]]s
have little or no support from authorities, along with little real in[[flu]]ence in decision making. In 23 years, "no environ[[mental]] regulations,
laws, or policies have ever been implemented by either [[government]],
[[Quebec]] or [[Canada]], pursuant to this agreement. They don't exist."58
A sensible response to this poor implementation [[history]] would be
agreements with more precise wording and with more actual authority
and jurisdiction for First Nations. Yet in the NFA the reliance on good
will in consultation is retained-recall that the NFA does not give the
Nisga'a Nation authority over development of the lands and resources
in 75-90 per cent of their traditional territories (the core Nisga' a Lands

excepted). The lessons which seem to have been learned from the

James [[Bay]] experience by [[Canadian]] [[government]]s are that agreements
must ensure that First Nations' self-[[government]] and land rights will
not be allowed to interfere substantially with the established provincial
[[government]] control of decisions relating to lands and resources.
The full implications of [[Canadian]] land claim policies can only be
seen when the land regimes, resource management and the extinguishment or certainty provisions of agreements are taken together: in both
the JBA and NFA the loss of control and ownership of most traditional
territories is accompanied by, and sealed with, the release of Aborigi56 See Posluns, Voices from the Odeyak, especially his discussion, at 179-218, of

veto over development projects on [[Aboriginal]] lands is a straightforward device
which could help rather than hinder the goal of certainty.

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 233
the concern that certainty provisions will sever the ties between future
generations and the land.
Almost 20 years after the signing of the agreement, [[Cree]] Grand
Chief Matthew Coon Come told the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]]
Peoples that
Extinguishment has injected a funda[[mental]] instability into the relationship between the [[Cree]]s and the other signatories of the James [[Bay]] and
[[North]]ern [[Quebec]] Agreement. For [[Aboriginal]] peoples, extinguishment
is brutal conquest attempted with a fountain pen. It is a funda[[mental]]

wrong, entrenched in provisions and laws that are funda[[mental]]ly
wrong.... Extinguishment is simply terra nullius [empty land-an old
colonial rationalization for expansion] applied after the fact. ... Many
of our collective and individual rights are to a large degree linked to our
lands and resources. Extinguishment attempts to sever our relationship
with our lands, under[[mining]] our identity and status. It attempts to deny
us beneficial enjoyment of our resources, while making others wealthy
and us dependent upon them for our basic needs. It puts the power to
make decisions about our lands and waters, and thus about us, exclusively in the hands of others. Its imposition is thus a profound denial of
our funda[[mental]] rights.62

Of the many important implications of this message I shall briefly discuss three. The passage is quoted at length because it succinctly captures much that has been said at various forums reviewing land claims

policy. First, Coon Come emphasizes that extinguishment clauses
appear in agreements only because of the inequalities in bargaining
power-extinguishment as "conquest attempted with a fountain pen."
Nation to nation negotiations, perhaps supervised by a binding and/or
international tribunal, would likely not result in sweeping surrenders
of rights and jurisdiction.

Second, Coon Come's claim that extinguishment has actually
produced uncertainty is not exaggerated rhetoric. Similar to those of
other First Nations communities in [[Canada]], there is a quickly growing
young [[Cree]] population. Yet the surrender of natural resources rights in
the JBA has made it difficult for [[Cree]] communities to create jobs for
the new generations-and the relative isolation of the region makes
62 Grand Council of the [[Cree]]s, Presentation to the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples, Montreal, [[Quebec]], [[November]] 18, [[1993]], 900-02, on the CD-ROM,

RCAP, "For Seven Generations" (under public meetings). See also, Union of
[[British]] Columbia [[Indian]] Chiefs, "Certainty: [[Canada]]'s Struggle to Extinguish
[[Aboriginal]] Title": the impact of certainty provisions "is to capture and tame [[aboriginal]] title and rights, and then place them in a cage constructed of words and
legal provisions. ... [[Canada]]'s strive for certainty reflects a desire that [[Indigenous]]

Peoples assimilate into [[Canada]], that we sever our connection to the Land." In
recommendation 2.4.1 the RCAP report notes that [[Aboriginal]] title is a constitutional right which ought to be protected by the crown.

In

cludes that the "enclaved" nature of the [[Cree]] communities is increas-

ing and he warns of long-term implications.63 The eventual political
fallout from this situation can hardly be said to be a basis for certainty.

Third, Coon Come's analysis reveals the interdependence between the symbolic and the practical effects of extinguishment, since
"under[[mining]] our identity and status" is accomplished alongside the
creation or retrenchment of the economic dependency rooted in the
lack of [[Cree]] jurisdiction and ownership of natural resources. In turn,
this lack of [[Cree]] ownership is convenient for provincial [[government]]s
and is a substantial benefit to the corporations exploiting the land's
resources, and thus "enriching others."

So it is regrettable that the NFA is close to the JBA on land
rights. The [[treaty]]-making process is still tainted by political inequality,
the land and resource ownership provisions may be insufficient for
future generations, and the release of Nisga'a title to most of the traditional territories will permit profitable exploitation by corporations

while under[[mining]] the bonds between those lands and Nisga'a citizens. [[Aboriginal]] title as a "burden" or obstacle is overcome; [[Aboriginal]] title as an opportunity for mutual accommodation and co-existence
is lost.64 In sum, in negotiating [[treaties]] federal and provincial [[government]]s continue to define First Nations' land rights as detracting from
the public interest because they may interfere with provincial regulation and distribution of lands and resources according to the imperatives of a market economy and according to the demands of corporate
interests and non-[[Aboriginal]] voters.65

63 Penn, "The James [[Bay]] Agreement."
64 This approach to [[Aboriginal]] rights is also in the NFA's references to the lack of
priority for the Nisga'a rights to fish and wildlife. See 8.2, 8.24, 8.25, 8.89(c) and
9.6.

65 Critical here is McNeils' analysis of how the Delgamuukw decision gives
provinces constitutionally gratuitous powers to infringe [[Aboriginal]] title on the
basis of a public interest argument (Defining [[Aboriginal]] Title). Also, in light of
this element of Delgamuukw, the Nisga'a acceptance of the compromise of the

NFA is understandable, since it is not clear that Delgamuukw will seriously

undermine provincial powers in practice. That all [[Canadian]]s would benefit from
an affirmation of [[Aboriginal]] title is mentioned briefly in Asch and Zlotkin,
"Affirming [[Aboriginal]] Title"(225).

The James [[Bay]] and Nisga'a Agreements in [[Canada]] 235
It should be remembered that [[Aboriginal]] title is troublesome only
from the perspective of corporate interests and from [[government]]s aiming to protect those interests. For progressive [[government]]s and fairminded [[Canadian]]s [[Aboriginal]] title could be a basis for mutual accommodation and for sharing lands and resources in a sustainable manner.
For First Nations, [[Aboriginal]] title encompasses their relationship to

lands and communities, including concepts of land stewardship-

which involves rights and responsibilities to the resources of the land
and water.66 But for these understandings to be embodied within-or,

better yet, respected by-[[Canadian]] law and policy there must be a
jurisdictional component, relevant over large areas, to the title.67
We have progressed since [[1867]] when Joseph Trutch, chief commissioner of lands and works in the [[colony]] of [[British]] Columbia, could

summarize the colonies' approach to [[Indian]] title as follows: "The
[[Indian]]s have really no right to the lands they claim, nor are they of any

actual value or utility to them, and I cannot see why they should either

retain these lands to the prejudice of the general interests of the

Colony, or be allowed to make a market of them either to the Government or to Individuals."68 While it is true that Trutch would likely not
support the NFA were he alive today, his views have not been fully

transcended: Nisga'a land rights have in fact been treated as something prejudicial to the "general interests" and therefore as something
to be minimized and contained. In order to secure ownership and control of some core territory the Nisga'a negotiators had to lose all but
residual hunting and consultative rights to most traditional lands.
5. Governance and Social Services

The "Nisga'a Government," chapter 11 of the NFA, though mostly

beyond the scope of this discussion, is clearly one of the most important and some general comments are directly relevant here.
First, the inclusion of the [[government]] chapter in the agreement at
all is a Nisga'a victory of some importance. Before the JBA [[treaties]]
typically avoided the issue of self-[[government]], and from [[1975]] to 1[[998]]
federal policy required that self-[[government]] agreements be separate

66 Definitions of [[Aboriginal]] title are in ibid., 214-16; and RCAP, [[Treaty]]-Making
chap. 1. For its meaning in [[Canadian]] law, see McNeil, Defining [[Aboriginal]] Title,
8-13.

67 Asch and Zlotkin argue that [[Aboriginal]] title is more like the [[British]] concept o
crown underlying title than like fee simple title ("Affirming [[Aboriginal]] Title,"
226).

68 As quoted by Berger, A Long and Terrible Shadow, 143 (emphasis added).
Trutch's position is still in[[flu]]ential within the Reform party and the BC Liberal
party.

[[trade]] and commerce. On education and social services there is a com-

plex mix of Nisga'a authority and provincial authority.
However, advocates of [[sovereignty]] for [[indigenous]] peoples point

out that Nisga'a law-making powers are concurrent with those of

[[Canada]] and [[British]] Columbia, and federal or provincial laws do prevail in other areas, whether or not they are mentioned in the agreement. Areas of explicit federal or provincial paramountcy include the
Criminal Code, environ[[mental]] protection and [[health]] services. Nisga'a
jurisdiction is also within the framework of the [[Canadian]] constitution
69 For example, the [[Nunavut]] land claims agreement has only one page on governance, stating that the separate political accord anticipated in the agreement will
not be constitutionally protected (see 4.1.3 of [[Indian]] and [[North]]ern Affairs [[Canada]], Agreement of the [[Nunavut]] Settlement Area). The powers exercised by the
[[Nunavut]] legislature are delegated and so are probably not constitutionally protected. A similar approach was taken in the [[Yukon]] agreements. There is, though,
ambiguity about the status of these self-[[government]] agreements because it is conceivable that the courts might deem them to be constitutionally protected in spite

of [[government]] intentions (see Peter W. Hogg and Mary Ellen Turpel, "Implementing [[Aboriginal]] Self-Government: Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues,"
in RCAP, [[Aboriginal]] Self-Government: Legal and Constitutional Issues [[[Ottawa]]:
Minister of Supply and Services, [[1995]]], 412).

and the NFA itself, and is subject to the [[Canadian]] Charter of Rights
and Freedoms. In other words, crown [[sovereignty]] is not altered by the
[[treaty]].

Moreover, protection of the powers of the Nisga'a Government
through section 35 of the Constitution Act, [[1982]]-which is explicit in
NFA and includes the "jurisdictions" of the Nisga'a [[government]]-is a
good, but not an absolute, guarantee that Nisga'a law will prevail. It is
unlikely, but conceivable, that federal or provincial legislation furthering a valid and specific public interest, and with the plain intent, could
infringe upon Nisga'a jurisdiction because it is identified as a section
35 [[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] right,70 and is thus subject to infringement
since the Supreme Court stated in Sparrow that "Rights that are recognized and affirmed are not absolute.""7 Yet, this limitation would be
extremely difficult, politically and legally, to employ given the clarity
of the NFA in assigning Nisga'a jurisdiction.
Such qualifications should not obscure the fact the Nisga'a [[government]] has some significant law-making powers which are not delegated by other [[government]]s: these powers are distinct from federal or
provincial powers, are protected by section 35, and they can only be
overridden by another [[government]] in extreme circumstances. This
shield against federal and provincial legislative powers has long been
sought by First Nations, and the Nisga'a Nation is the first to have
achieved it. The powers of the [[Cree]] band councils, for example, are
defined by the [[1984]] [[Cree]]-Naskapi Act. It replaces the [[Indian]] Act for
the [[Cree]]s and Naskapis and was a significant step at the time. It provides municipal-like by-law-making powers that are the creation of the
federal Act and thus could be modified by subsequent legislation.72
Funding for governance and services is obviously extremely important, but is beyond the scope of this discussion. Briefly, though, the
JBA has unique provisions for ensuring appropriate funding levels for
things like education, yet funding has been a chronic source of federal-[[Cree]] dispute,73 and federal negotiators have tried to get the [[Cree]]s
to "sign-off" on various [[treaty]] entitlements. The federal [[government]]
has interpreted the agreement so that it can treat the [[Cree]]s as "regular" [[Indian]] communities with regular [[Indian]] Affairs programmes as

70 NFA 2.23.

Badger, [[[1996]]] 2 [[Canadian]] [[Native]] Law Reporter 77 (SCC) will be centra

assessing the possibility of infringements of section 35 rights of [[Aboriginal]]
ernance; see especially para. 85.
72 The NFA goes well beyond the JBA in other areas too, including administr
of justice and the creation of a Nisga'a court.

Federalism and the Federal Role

The NFA is quite clear that there are no Nisga'a lands designated "re-

serves" as in the [[Indian]] Act, nor any which are considered "lands

reserved for the [[Indian]]s" under the constitution, thus attempting75 to end

a central component of federal responsibility under section 91(24) of the
Constitution Act, [[1867]]. This is troubling because it furthers the goal of
those trying to end the unique constitutional status of [[Aboriginal]] peoples
in [[Canada]]. It also has significant, complex implications for the fiduciary
obligations of the federal [[government]], which are partly derived from the
jurisdiction accorded in 91(24). This attempt to devolve historical obligations will be controversial when the NFA is used as a model for other
agreements. The [[Cree]]s have often relied on the federal role in [[Cree]] lands
to restrain provincial powers, and, given the shameful implementation

74 NFA 15.3. Nisga'a citizens give up their status-[[Indian]]-related tax exemptions, a
major concession. The criteria for Nisga'a [[government]] funding does not address
the damage caused by over a century of socially destructive "[[Indian]] policies,"

while it does consider the "prevailing fiscal policies of [[Canada]] and [[British]]
Columbia" (NFA 15.9[1]). Especially troubling is 15.5 which asserts that the

[[treaty]] does not "create or imply" funding obligations.
75 NFA 2.10, and see note 35, above. The fee simple status of Nisga'a lands, discussed
in section 4 of this article, is also an aspect of the attempt to end federal responsibili-

ties. But this type of devolution might be good if it is in response to First Nations'
wishes and if it is a transfer of genuine powers to First Nations [[government]]s and not
to provinces. The full implications of the NFA on this question are beyond the scope
of this article.

[[history]] of the JBA, a strong federal role makes sense as a potential bal-

ance against provincial abuse of [[treaties]] (even if [[Quebec]] and [[Canada]]
have proved equally s[[kill]]ed at ignoring JBA promises).76

6. Conclusions: [[Aboriginal]] Difference and the Nisga'a [[Treaty]]
The NFA is a good agreement when considered in light of the inequities
built into established [[treaty]] negotiation processes and given the precarious place of [[Aboriginal]] rights in [[British]] Columbia politics. In both the
NFA and the JBA, what [[Aboriginal]] negotiators achieved is laudable, and
suggests that the [[Canadian]] state may be capable of moving beyond its
long-standing objective of assimilating [[Aboriginal]] peoples into the general population (against Menno Boldt's thesis, for example77). The NFA
secures ownership and control of a land base much much larger than
most reserves and includes rights to natural resources and a share in a
valuable fishery. The [[treaty]] also creates a constitutionally protected and
possibly well-funded central [[government]] whose laws will prevail over
federal and provincial laws in some areas. These are not effective instruments for the elimination of the uniqueness of a community. Caution
must be exercised in criticizing the Nisga'a leadership for accepting too
many integrative (into the dominant society) components in the [[treaty]]:

Nisga'a leaders consistently talked of finding their place within

[[Canada]],78 and any workable plan for First Nation autonomy must have

some integrative components given the small population and fiscal
dependence (at present) of First Nations in [[Canada]].79
In sections 3 and 4, however, I have examined some of the elements of the NFA that support Boldt's thesis, all related to the general
[[treatment]] of [[Aboriginal]] title. Certainly the agreement is not nearly so
76 The environ[[mental]] provisions rely on a strong federal presence-albeit a presence
which has not, in practice, been visible let alone strong (Penn "The James [[Bay]]
Agreement," and Posluns Voices from the Odeyak).
77 "The most insidious and perilous assault on [[Indian]] special status is concentrated on
the institutional assimilation of [[Indian]]s, that is, the progressive incorporation of Indi-

ans into the political, legal, social and economic institutional framework of [[Canadian]] society. The ultimate goal is the elimination of all institutional arrangements
that set [[Indian]]s apart from [[Canadian]]s" (Menno Boldt, Surviving as [[Indian]]s: The
Challenge of Self-Government [[[Toronto]]: University of [[Toronto]] Press, [[1993]]], 79).
Penn points out that the JBA accords with some parts of the assimilationalist [[1969]]
[[white]] paper on [[Indian]] policy ("The James [[Bay]] Agreement").
78 "Under the [[treaty]], the Nisga'a people will join [[Canada]] and [[British]] Columbia as free
citizens-full and equal participants in the social, economic, and political life of this
province, of this country." From "Chief Gosnell's Historic Speech to the [[British]]

Columbia Legislature," [[December]] 2, 1[[998]], at from http://www.ntc.bc.ca/gos-

[[Aboriginal]] Peoples will likely not be possible because agreements and

[[treaties]] will either be unreachable or be tainted as coerced surrenders.

And rebuilding [[Aboriginal]] nations may lack a sufficient land base.83
Judging from the content and implementation of the James [[Bay]]
Agreement, and from the content of the Nisga'a [[treaty]], it is clear that

[[Canadian]] political and corporate elites do not want to have to deal

with evolving concepts of [[Aboriginal]] rights to land. They continue to
demand that the lands of [[Aboriginal]] peoples be brought into the familiar and predictable reach of crown [[sovereignty]] and [[Canadian]] [[property]]
law. This is probably because it is on the basis of a distinct title with

precontact origins-along with a jurisdictional component relevant

over large areas-that the rights and aspirations of First Nations would
pose a funda[[mental]] challenge to established socio-economic and political practices. The lack of progress at the end of the twentieth century
on land rights issues is deeply troubling and demonstrates that First

Nations relations have not been [[immune]] to the corporate agenda

which has dominated other areas of [[Canadian]] policy making.
