## Reaching ‘Herd Immunity’ Is Unlikely in the U.S., Experts Now Believe

Early in the [[pandemic]], when [[vaccine]]s for the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] were still just a glimmer on the horizon, the term “herd [[immunity]]” came to signify the endgame: the point when enough [[American]]s would be protected from the [[virus]] so we could be rid of the pathogen and reclaim our lives.

Now, more than half of [[adults]] in the [[United]] [[States]] have been inoculated with at least one dose of a [[vaccine]]. But daily vaccination rates are slipping, and there is widespread consensus among scientists and public health experts that the herd [[immunity]] threshold is not attainable — at least not in the foreseeable future, and perhaps not ever.

Instead, they are coming to the conclusion that rather than making a long-promised exit, the [[virus]] will most likely become a manageable threat that will continue to circulate in the [[United]] [[States]] for years to come, still causing hospitalizations and [[death]]s but in much smaller numbers.

How much smaller is uncertain and depends in part on how much of the nation, and the world, becomes vaccinated and how the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] evolves. It is already clear, however, that the [[virus]] is changing too quickly, new variants are spreading too easily and vaccination is proceeding too slowly for herd [[immunity]] to be within reach anytime soon.

Continued immunizations, especially for people at highest risk because of age, exposure or health status, will be crucial to limiting the severity of outbreaks, if not their frequency, experts believe.

“The [[virus]] is unlikely to go away,” said Rustom Antia, an evolutionary biologist at Emory [[University]] in Atlanta. “But we want to do all we can to check that it’s likely to become a mild infection.”

The shift in outlook presents a new challenge for public health authorities. The drive for herd [[immunity]] — by the summer, some experts once thought possible — captured the imagination of large segments of the public. To say the goal will not be attained adds another “why bother” to the list of reasons that [[vaccine]] skeptics use to avoid being inoculated.

Yet vaccinations remain the key to transforming the [[virus]] into a controllable threat, experts said.

Dr. Anthony S. [[Fauci]], the Biden administration’s top adviser on [[Covid]]-19, acknowledged the shift in experts’ thinking.

“People were getting confused and thinking you’re never going to get the infections down until you reach this mystical level of herd [[immunity]], whatever that number is,” he said.

“That’s why we stopped using herd [[immunity]] in the classic sense,” he added. “I’m saying: Forget that for a second. You vaccinate enough people, the infections are going to go down.”
Why reaching the threshold is tough

Once the novel [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] began to spread across the globe in early [[2020]], it became increasingly clear that the only way out of the [[pandemic]] would be for so many people to gain [[immunity]] — whether through natural infection or vaccination — that the [[virus]] would run out of people to infect. The concept of reaching herd [[immunity]] became the implicit goal in many countries, including the [[United]] [[States]].

Early on, the target herd [[immunity]] threshold was estimated to be about 60 to 70 percent of the population. Most experts, including Dr. [[Fauci]], expected that the [[United]] [[States]] would be able to reach it once [[vaccine]]s were available.

But as [[vaccine]]s were developed and distribution ramped up through the winter and into the spring, estimates of the threshold began to rise. That is because the initial calculations were based on the contagiousness of the original version of the [[virus]]. The predominant variant now circulating in the [[United]] [[States]], called B.1.1.7 and first identified in [[Britain]], is about 60 percent more transmissible.

As a result, experts now calculate the herd [[immunity]] threshold to be at least 80 percent. If even more contagious variants develop, or if scientists find that immunized people can still transmit the [[virus]], the calculation will have to be revised upward again.

Polls show that about 30 percent of the U.S. population is still reluctant to be vaccinated. That number is expected to improve but probably not enough. “It is theoretically possible that we could get to about 90 percent vaccination coverage, but not super likely, I would say,” said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Though resistance to the [[vaccine]]s is a main reason the [[United]] [[States]] is unlikely to reach herd [[immunity]], it is not the only one.

Herd [[immunity]] is often described as a national target. But that is a hazy concept in a country this large.

“[[Disease]] transmission is local,” Dr. Lipsitch noted.

“If the coverage is 95 percent in the [[United]] [[States]] as a whole, but 70 percent in some small town, the [[virus]] doesn’t care,” he explained. “It will make its way around the small town.”
Uneven Willingness to Get Vaccinated Could Affect Herd Immunity

How insulated a particular region is from the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] depends on a dizzying array of factors.

Herd [[immunity]] can [[flu]]ctuate with “population crowding, human behavior, sanitation and all sorts of other things,” said Dr. David M. Morens, a virologist and senior adviser to Dr. [[Fauci]]. “The herd [[immunity]] for a wealthy neighborhood might be X, then you go into a crowded neighborhood one block away and it’s 10X.”

Given the degree of movement among regions, a small [[virus]] wave in a region with a low vaccination level can easily spill over into an area where a majority of the population is protected.

At the same time, the connectivity between countries, particularly as travel restrictions ease, emphasizes the urgency of protecting not just [[American]]s but everyone in the world, said Natalie E. Dean, a biostatistician at the [[University]] of Florida in Gainesville. Any variants that arise in the world will eventually reach the [[United]] [[States]], she noted.

Many parts of the world lag far behind the [[United]] [[States]] on vaccinations. Less than 2 percent of the people in India have been fully vaccinated, for example, and less than 1 percent in South [[Africa]], according to data compiled by The New York Times.

“We will not achieve herd [[immunity]] as a country or a state or even as a city until we have enough [[immunity]] in the population as a whole,” said Lauren Ancel Meyers, the director of the [[Covid]]-19 Modeling Consortium at the [[University]] of Texas at Austin.
What the future may hold

If the herd [[immunity]] threshold is not attainable, what matters most is the rate of hospitalizations and [[death]]s after [[pandemic]] restrictions are relaxed, experts believe.

By focusing on vaccinating the most vulnerable, the [[United]] [[States]] has already brought those numbers down sharply. If the vaccination levels of that group continue to rise, the expectation is that over time the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] may become seasonal, like the [[flu]], and affect mostly the young and healthy.

“What we want to do at the very least is get to a point where we have just really sporadic little flare-ups,” said Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the [[University]] of [[Washington]] in Seattle. “That would be a very sensible target in this country where we have an excellent [[vaccine]] and the ability to deliver it.”

Over the long term — a generation or two — the goal is to transition the new [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] to become more like its cousins that cause common colds. That would mean the first infection is early in [[child]]hood, and subsequent infections are mild because of partial protection, even if [[immunity]] wanes.

Some unknown proportion of people with mild cases may go on to experience debilitating symptoms for weeks or months — a syndrome called “long [[Covid]]” — but they are unlikely to overwhelm the health care system.

“The vast majority of the mortality and of the stress on the health care system comes from people with a few particular conditions, and especially people who are over 60,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “If we can protect those people against severe illness and [[death]], then we will have turned [[Covid]] from a society disrupter to a regular infectious disease.”

If communities maintain vigilant [[testing]] and tracking, it may be possible to bring the number of new cases so low that health officials can identify any new introduction of the [[virus]] and immediately stifle a potential outbreak, said Bary Pradelski, an economist at the National Center for Scientific [[Research]] in Grenoble, [[France]]. He and his colleagues described this strategy in a paper published on Thursday in the scientific journal The Lancet.

“Eradication is, I think, impossible at this stage,” Dr. Pradelski said. “But you want local elimination.”

Vaccination is still the key

The endpoint has changed, but the most pressing challenge remains the same: persuading as many people as possible to get the shot.

Reaching a high level of [[immunity]] in the population “is not like winning a race,” Dr. Lipsitch said. “You have to then feed it. You have to keep vaccinating to stay above that threshold.”

Skepticism about the [[vaccine]]s among many [[American]]s and lack of access in some groups — homeless populations, migrant workers or some communities of color — make it a challenge to achieve that goal. Vaccine mandates would only make that stance worse, some experts believe.

A better approach would be for a trusted figure to address the root cause of the hesitancy — fear, mistrust, misconceptions, ease of access or a desire for more information, said Mary Politi, an expert in health decision making and health communication at [[general topics/PLACES/WASHINGTON]] [[University]] in St. Louis.

People often need to see others in their social circle embracing something before they are willing to try it, Dr. Politi said. Emphasizing the benefits of vaccination to their lives, like seeing a family member or sending their [[child]]ren to school, might be more motivating than the nebulous idea of herd [[immunity]].

“That would resonate with people more than this somewhat elusive concept that experts are still trying to figure out,” she added.

Though [[child]]ren spread the [[virus]] less efficiently than [[adults]] do, the experts all agreed that vaccinating [[child]]ren would also be important for keeping the number of [[Covid]] cases low. In the long term, the public health system will also need to account for babies, and for [[child]]ren and [[adults]] who age into a group with higher risk.

Unnerving scenarios remain on the path to this long-term vision.

Over time, if not enough people are protected, highly contagious variants may develop that can break through [[vaccine]] protection, land people in the hospital and put them at risk of [[death]].

“That’s the nightmare scenario,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia [[University]].

How frequent and how severe those breakthrough infections are have the potential to determine whether the [[United]] [[States]] can keep hospitalizations and [[death]]s low or if the country will find itself in a “mad scramble” every couple of years, he said.

“I think we’re going to be looking over our shoulders — or at least public health officials and infectious disease epidemiologists are going to be looking over their shoulders going: ‘All right, the variants out there — what are they doing? What are they capable of?” he said. “[[May]]be the general public can go back to not worrying about it so much, but we will have to.”
