### **When did [[Doctors]] [[Fauci]] and Baric find out about the [[China]] [[corona[[virus]]]] leak in [[Wuhan]] and how did they know it?** 

### **Why was the US investigating the [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]] before the [[Western]] world even knew about it?**

On [[April]] 9, [[2020]], we were the [first media outlet](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/[[2020]]/04/huge-exclusive-chinese-doctor-shi-zhengli-ran-[[corona[[virus]]]]-research-wuhan-us-project-shut-dhs-[[2014]]-risky-prior-leak-[[kill]]ed-researcher/) to report on major events leading up to the [[China]] [[corona[[virus]]]] leak that we suspected came from the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology.  We were able to determine [[Chinese]] Doctor Shi Zhengli was part of a team that was working on a [[corona[[virus]]]] project jointly with US doctors in [[2014]] before it was shut down by the DHS for being too risky.

After the US research project was shut down, Dr. Shi continued her [[corona[[virus]]]] research in [[Wuhan]], [[China]].

We reported that Doctor Shi Zhengli from [[China]] was part of a team, including [Doctor Ralph S. Baric](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/ralph-s-baric-phd/) from North Carolina, that [published an article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985) in a [[2015]] edition of Nature Medicine.

In the article, they discussed bat [[corona[[virus]]]]es that showed potential for human emergence.  The article was published in [[2015]].

**This report was published shortly after their project was defunded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).** 

**The HHS in [[2014]] sent a letter to the [[University]] of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where they announced they were going to defund the program.**

**Dr. Ralph S. Baric was identified in the letter.**

After the work stopped in the US, the [[Chinese]] moved forward with the project and ran research and development in [[Wuhan]] at the [[Wuhan]] Virology Center. From Shi Zhengli’s papers and resume, it is clear that they successfully isolated the [[virus]] in the lab and were actively [[experiment]]ing with species <-> species transmission.

Today, Dr. Lawrence Sellin, who contributed much to this effort to uncover the truth about [[COVID]], reported that **a [[December]] 12, [[2019]] agreement was signed by Dr. Ralph Baric that he would receive the “m[[RNA]] [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]] candidates developed and jointly-owned by NIAID and [[Moderna]]”:**

**The [[Moderna]] m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]] is now being given to people around the world. ** [[Pfizer]] also has an m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]. Ralph Baric is a long-time [[corona[[virus]]]] researcher with close ties with the batwoman and the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology as noted above in our post from [[April]] [[2020]].  [[December]] 12, [[2019]], is very early in the [[COVID]]-19 outbreak before it was reported in the West. Baric would be a logical person to test the efficacy of an m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]].

What this tells us is that [[Doctors]] Baric and [[Fauci]] may have been aware of what was happening in [[China]] and [[Fauci]] and [[Moderna]] were likely working on [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]]s before [[COVID]]-19 was announced in the West.  The [[Moderna]] [[vaccine]] was ready for human [[testing]] very quickly.

It seems to be hardly a coincidence that Baric, who does not appear anywhere else in the confidential agreements should appear at such a consequential moment.

We can’t say this is a smoking gun of any type, but it is something not widely known and it certainly generates additional questions.

Here is a video someone shared with us regarding this topic:

### **Did doctors [[Fauci]] and Baric know about the [[China]] [[corona[[virus]]]] being released and when did they know it?  So many questions.
