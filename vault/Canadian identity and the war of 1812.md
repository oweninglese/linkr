Abstract
In [[2012]], the Harper [[government]] launched a national celebration of the bicentennial of
the [[War]] of [[1812]], even though few [[Canadian]]s were aware of the anniversary or of the
war itself. While commemorating a largely unknown war might at first seem counter
intuitive, this article argues that the focus on the [[War]] of [[1812]] represented an oppor
tunity to engage in the construction of a different [[Canadian]] identity. In effect, the
narrative surrounding the [[War]] of [[1812]] celebrations permitted the Conservative gov
ernment to begin to establish a new "warrior identity" in contrast to the "peacekeeping
identity" that has been associated with liberal internationalism and the Liberal Party.
While liberal internationalism in both the study and practice of [[Canadian]] foreign policy
contributed to a national identity framed around shared internationalist values, the
narratives presented during the [[War]] of [[1812]] celebrations suggest an alternative under
standing of the "true" nature of [[Canadian]] identity.

[[Canada]]'s foreign policy and foreign wars—both "old" and new. Despite a cli
mate of fiscal austerity, budget cutting, and the downsizing of the federal public
service, the [[government]] of [[Canada]] chose to spend between approximately $
and $40 million2 during [[2012]] in commemoration of the bicentennial of the [[War]]
of [[1812]]. A special silver dollar coin, a new national monument on Parliament
Hill, funding for historical re-enactments, upgrades for historic sites, museum
```

##### exhibits at the National [[War]] Museum, and even a mobile phone app were

among the ways [[Canadian]] taxpayer dollars were mobilized to support the cele  
bration of the anniversary.3 Heritage [[Minister]] James Moore defended the deci  
sion to spend millions of dollars by pointing to the growth in popular interest in  
the [[War]] of [[1812]] since the [[government]] had launched its commemoration plans.  
"[[Canadian]]s are realizing that it is something that should be recognized across  
the country, not just in the regions where the [[battle]]s took place," he said.  
Moore went on to argue that even if people wanted to debate the wisdom of  
the [[government]]'s investment, "it's an essential role for [[government]] to remind  
[[Canadian]]s what unites us."  
For Moore, the commemoration of the [[War]] of [[1812]] was an exercise conceived  
in part to remind [[Canadian]]s of what and who they are as a people. The commem  
oration was justified, among other reasons, by the [[government]]'s perception of  
a lack of emphasis placed on the teaching of [[Canadian]] [[history]] in high schools.  
As a result, argued [[Minister]] Moore, "it falls upon all of us who have a passionate  
belief in [[Canadian]] [[history]], who have a deep feeling that we should be doing a better  
job of educating our [[kids]], to take advantage of moments like this \[the bicentennial  
of the [[War]] of [[1812]]\],"5 notwithstanding the fact that high school curricula are not  
under federal jurisdiction. Through the bicentennial celebrations, the [[Canadian]]  
[[government]] cast itself as [[history]] teacher, underlining the importance of "these  
historic moments" and of educating "our [[kids]] about the greatness that [[Canada]]

going forward."6 As if to confirm the necessity of this educative mission, a com  
prehensive survey conducted by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives Inc. for the  
Department of National Defence revealed that "few people who took part in the  
survey, and in related focus groups, were aware of the anniversary, and even fewer  
could identify the [[War]] of [[1812]] by name." The [[research]]ers went on to note that  
"typically, no more than one or two participants in each \[focus\] group were aware  
that this year is the bicentennial commemoration of the [[War]] of [[1812]], and these  
people tended to deduce this with simple arithmetic. From the year, [[1812]], they  
made the logical leap to the [[War]] of [[1812]]. Most focus group participants had no  
prior awareness of this anniversary."  
This article begins to unpack the ways in which the commemoration of the  
[[War]] of [[1812]] represents an exercise in identity reconstruction. The efforts of the  
Conservative [[government]] to rescue the war from the obscurity of being a  
"mostly forgotten war, except by the handful of professional historians on

##### both sides of the [[Canada]]-US border, and the handfuls of people who live

```
[[Canadian]] [[history]] took place decades before [[Canada]] became a sovereign state,
empowered with the right to make its own policies, including its own foreign
policy. As Jeffrey Simpson has noted, the celebration of [[Canada]]'s military
prowess in this war ignores the fact that in [[1812]], "[t]here was no [[Canadian]]
army, although there were [[Canadian]] volunteers serving with the [[British]], for the
[[Canadian]] colonies were governed by the [[British]]." Further, the argument that
"by frustrating the [[American]]s, [[Canada]] was saved as a sovereign nation" belies
the fact that "there was no such thing as a sovereign [[Canadian]] nation at the
time of the war."10 Finding the roots of what unites [[Canadian]]s from a time
when [[Canada]] did not exist as a sovereign state—much less a unified nation—
must be understood as a distinctly political strategy. If the Harper [[government]]
had wanted to celebrate an important event in [[Canadian]] [[history]] in the year
[[2012]], for whatever reasons of national unity or harmony, it had other choices:

9. It is interesting to note that even for those living in communities most affected by the [[War]] of [[1812]],

   "even in areas where the war was fought—specifically [[Ontario]]'s Niagara Region—awareness  
   remained foggy. In St Catharines, which is geographically close to where some significant

choices to be medicare and the Charter."11 It had to be difficult to identify the  
[[War]] of [[1812]] as one of [[Canada]]'s enduring symbols when the vast majority of  
[[Canadian]]s were unaware of the war or why it might be important, both before  
and throughout the bicentennial celebrations.  
The choice of the [[War]] of [[1812]] as the historical milestone around which the

Harper [[government]] organized a series of events, activities, and testimonials, there  
fore, cannot be separated from its political agenda and its understanding of the  
world into which [[Canada]]'s foreign policy is projected. Neither medicare (the result  
of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)/New Democratic Party (NDP)  
policies) nor the Charter (brought into being by the federal Liberal Party) would  
respond to the exigencies of Conservative Party politics. The advantage of the [[War]]  
of [[1812]] as part of a new national narrative was that not only would it allow the  
[[government]] to begin to recast the place of the war (and of war more generally) in  
[[Canadian]] popular [[history]], it would do so in and against a particular context—that  
of [[Canadian]] internationalism—long identified with the Liberal Party of [[Canada]].  
As Kim Richard Nossal has argued, the overarching foreign policy orientation of  
the Harper [[government]] has been the belief in a Manichaean view of world politics,  
wherein the international scene is dominated by "a struggle between good and  
bad," and in such a black and [[white]] world, "the real defining moments for the  
country and for the world are those big conflicts where everything's at stake and  
where you take a side and show you can contribute to the right side."12 In addition,  
however, as Nossal has detailed, for the Harper [[government]], "the primary purpose  
of international policy is to advance a domestic partisan agenda."13 To state it  
more bluntly, foreign policy is also an instrument (among many others) that can be  
deployed to assure the destruction of the Liberal Party as the "natural governing  
party" of [[Canada]], and its replacement in that role by the Conservative Party. The  
celebration of the [[War]] of [[1812]] is consistent with these objectives not only because it  
casts [[Canada]] as a country "born out of conflict"14 that chose to fight for the  
"right" side and the "right" cause, but also because it creates the space in which  
it becomes possible to respond to and begin to reframe the identity markers fur  
nished for decades by the internationalism of Louis St. Laurent, Lester B. Pearson,  
and the Liberal Party of [[Canada]].  
If the framing of the [[War]] of [[1812]] was done in response to the tenets of liberal  
(and Liberal) internationalism, it is useful to return briefly to the meanings  
associated with it. While internationalism has been understood as a series of  
foreign policy practices (support for international institutions, multilateral pro  
cesses, and international law) giving middle power countries the potential to  
in[[flu]]ence great powers within multilateral structures, internationalism has

##### also "promoted a sense of [[Canadian]] identity at the national and inter

```
national levels."15 In this sense, the study of [[Canadian]] foreign policy is not
only about the policy practices of the [[Canadian]] [[government]]; it also asks ques
tions about how these practices contribute to defining the nature of [[Canada]]. In
its promotion of [[Canadian]] identity, two elements of liberal internationalism
stand out as critical: first, internationalism implies a conviction about the
higher calling to which [[Canadian]]s are held; its "purpose," in that sense, is to
provide a unifying common understanding of the virtues of [[Canada]] as an inter
national "brand" despite the complexities of [[Canadian]] diversity. As such, the
moral content of [[Canadian]] foreign policy (helpful fixer, good international citi
zen, peacekeeper, protector of the weak) is a powerful contributor to national
unity; if selflessness and altruism define who and what [[Canada]] is on the inter
national scene, they also affirm who and what [[Canadian]]s are at home. Second,
and directly related to the first, the moral content of liberal internationalism
projects a [[Canadian]] identity distinct from that of its southern neighbour, defining
a set of ways for [[Canadian]]s to assert (and to confirm) their distinctiveness from
the [[United]] [[States]].
```

```
The [[War]] of [[1812]] as a new discursive frame
```

The celebration of the bicentennial of the [[War]] of [[1812]] reframes [[Canadian]] identity  
in ways different from the frame provided by liberal (and Liberal) internationalism.  
Despite its differences, however, the [[1812]] reframing of the "true" nature of  
[[Canadian]] identity continues to respond to the two imperatives of the internation  
alist discourse outlined above: the construction of a unifying pan-[[Canadian]] iden  
tity that also asserts [[Canada]]'s distinctiveness from the [[United]] [[States]].  
Liberal internationalism as a discursive project is intimately linked to [[Canada]]'s  
role in the resolution of the Suez Crisis and the awarding of Lester B. Pearson's  
Nobel Peace Prize. The recasting of [[Canada]] from a peacekeeping nation to one  
"born out of conflict" is, in the Harper [[government]]'s framing, also tied to one  
event: this time, the [[War]] of [[1812]]. It is worthy of note that by articulating the [[War]]  
of [[1812]] as a national project before there was a nation, the Harper [[government]] is at  
least implicitly suggesting that a peace prize awarded in the [[1950]]s constitutes an  
aberration in the definition of [[Canada]]'s "authentic" national identity. It is not  
Nobel Peace Prizes that "define who we are as [[Canadian]]s," but rather the "vet  
erans who defended our land and ultimately won the fight for [[Canada]]."16 In this,  
the [[government]] of [[Canada]] is (arguably more subtly) reflecting the views of one of  
the most ardent defenders of [[Canada]]'s militaristic past, Jack Granatstein. In focus  
ing on the [[War]] of [[1812]], the Harper [[government]] is merely "highlighting something

everyone should know about anyway. There is a military past in [[Canada]], and it  
should be noted—not... hidden behind soft 'pacifist' views that have been perpe  
tuated by popular social [[history]] of the last 40 years."17 From this perspective, the  
legacy of the Pearson Nobel Peace Prize is to be found in the soft pacifist views that  
deny [[Canada]]'s true military identity—and the "truth" of that identity is enshrined  
in the date of its birth: [[1812]] rather than [[1956]].

#### [[1812]] as a unifying moment

The recasting of [[Canada]] as a military or warrior nation (rather than as a peace  
keeping one) does not merely rest on the ability of the [[government]] to reach further  
back into [[history]] than the peacekeeping narrative is able to go.18 Considerable

##### efforts are deployed to create a discourse that unifies rather than divides

[[Canadian]]s. Of particular note, the representations of the [[War]] of [[1812]] emphasize  
the participation of [[Canada]]'s [[First]] [[Nations]], as well as of francophone [[Canadian]]  
soldiers, in the effort to vanquish the enemy. The war's commemorative symbols  
focus on this tripartite "[[Canadian]]" [[alliance]]. As an example, the special silver dollar  
coin produced by the [[Canadian]] Mint (selling for almost $60) depicts "a [[British]]  
sergeant, a Voltigeur Canadien and an Iroquois warrior wearing historically accur  
ate uniforms, approaching the invader with unity of purpose to defend the border  
and colonies they represent."19 The "major figures" deemed central to the war  
effort similarly highlight the contributions of [[Canadian]]s of anglophone, franco  
phone, and [[First]] [[Nations]] backgrounds.20 As the Government of [[Canada]]'s [[War]] of  
[[1812]] website reminds us, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, the "Hero of Upper  
[[Canada]]," was a member of the [[British]] Army. With the arrival of war in [[1812]],  
he initiated an aggressive campaign to protect Upper [[Canada]], even though his  
superiors had advised him to remain on the defensive. Tecumseh, a Shawnee  
chief and leader of a large tribal confederacy that opposed [[American]] territorial  
expansion, joined Brock in the [[battle]] to capture Detroit on 16 [[August]] [[1812]]. For his  
part, Charles de Salaberry served as an officer of the [[British]] Army in Lower  
[[Canada]] (now [[Quebec]]). As war loomed in the spring of [[1812]], he helped raise a  
unit of militia corps, known as the [[Canadian]] Voltigeurs, from among his primarily

3 [[April]] [[2013]]).
The [[government]] of [[Canada]] is not content to reach back to [[1812]] to confirm [[Canada]]'s militaristic
roots. Extensive celebrations are planned for [[2017]] in remembrance of the [[1917]] Battle of Vimy
Ridge and the sacrifice of thousands of [[Canadian]] soldiers. As a precursor to these celebrations, the
new polymer $20 bill features the [[Canadian]] National Vimy Memorial located in northern [[France]],
rather than the artwork by [[First]] [[Nations]] artist Bill Reid, notably his sculptures Raven and the [[First]]
Men and Spirit of Haida Gwaii, as was the case with the "old" $20 bill.

[[Canadian]]s in the prosecution of the war. For example, in a speech given in the
[[Quebec]] community of Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix in [[September]] [[2012]], Harper
emphasized the importance of the contributions of francophone [[Canadian]]s to
the war effort: "One of those men was Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry. He bril
liantly led his troops, the Voltigeurs canadiens, at the Battle of Châteauguay. His
heroic victory made it possible to protect Montreal. His achievements made him
one of our most esteemed military leaders."22 In a ceremony held at Rideau Hall to
honour the contributions of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in the [[War]] of [[1812]], Harper con
tinued in this vein, this time highlighting the role of [[Canada]]'s [[First]] [[Nations]]:
```

##### "During the [[War]] of [[1812]], [[First]] [[Nations]] and Métis warriors stood shoulder

```
to-shoulder with English and [[French]]-speaking militias and [[British]] military forces
to defend our country against [[American]] invaders... Without their courage and
honour, [[Canada]] would not have been able to successfully defend itself and we
would not have the peaceful and prosperous country our citizens enjoy today."
The true point of Harper's testimonials became clear later in his speech honouring
```

##### De Salaberry and providing retroactive theatre distinctions ("Defence of

[[Canada]]—[[1812]] to [[1815]]") to six [[Canadian]] regiments whose precursors participated

The regiments honoured include of course the Royal 22e and the Voltigeurs de

```

```
The 22e Régiment in particular is well known for its important role in both world wars
and more recently in Afghanistan.

```
But its origins date back in fact to the fight for [[Canada]] in [[1812]], in particular the
[[battle]]s in the Châteauguay region under De Salaberry.

And the famous Citadelle of [[Québec]] was built in response to that war.

It is another example of the in[[flu]]ence that the [[War]] of [[1812]] has had up to this very day
both on our [[history]] as a country and on our cultural heritage.
```

```
Friends, what makes this war so important is that [[French]] [[Canadian]]s, English,
[[Aboriginal]] peoples and many others, like freed [[slaves]], took up arms together to
achieve a common objective, to resist the [[American]] invasion.
```

```
And the ties our ancestors forged laid the foundations of a truly pan-[[Canadian]] iden
tity and made our Confederation possible, a country of great cultural diversity with
two national languages.
```

```
Let us always remember that this country, [[Canada]], exists only because of diverse
peoples, English-speaking, [[French]]-speaking, [[Aboriginal]], and others, who came
together in [[1812]] to resist the [[American]] invasion and to defend their unique identities
and our shared territory.
```

The [[War]] of [[1812]] assumes an almost mythical status in this retelling, for it becomes  
a moment in which a "true" [[Canadian]] national identity is forged. In contrast to  
[[Canadian]] internationalism, where a pan-[[Canadian]] identity is constructed through  
an attachment to specific political values (however exaggerated), this new [[Canadian]]  
identity is born of political necessity. [[Canada]]'s identity stems from the commitment  
of its peoples—especially English, [[French]], and [[First]] [[Nations]]—to defending  
[[Canada]] from [[American]] invasion. [[Canada]], as the former minister of national  
defence Peter MacKay would have it, was thus "born out of conflict" rather  
than out of legislative gradualism. In this narrative, [[Canada]] was forged in the  
crucible of war, in which all of its founding peoples played a key role. Of course,  
these claims of collaboration between all of [[Canada]]'s peoples gloss over how many  
residents of what would become [[Ontario]] would have been happier fighting for the  
[[American]]s (and providing them aid and comfort when they could). Similarly, in the  
[[United]] [[States]], there were clear divisions between Republicans and Federalists over  
the wisdom of the war. Historian Alan Taylor's much-respected [[2010]] book, The  
Civil [[War]] of [[1812]], suggests the extent to which representations of the war as a  
[[battle]] between two nations is overstated to the point of misrepresentation.  
More importantly, the [[1812]] portrait of a unified [[Canada]] is not developed  
around the values of peacekeeping or good international citizenship; it is not  
[[Canada]]—the honest broker. It is [[Canada]] the warrior nation, with all of its peoples  
participating in that warrior inclination. Individual differences between [[Canadian]]s  
based on their language or ethnic group are largely irrelevant in this warrior nation.

24. [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Stephen Harper, "PM delivers remarks in Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix, [[Quebec]]."  
    Of course, the defence of [[Canada]] theatre distinctions were being awarded for [[battle]]s waged at a  
    time when [[Canada]] did not exist and therefore cannot be said to have been defended, at least not as  
    properly understood.

(^160) International Journal 69(2)  
For Harper, this point is particularly clear, as he revealed in his [[Canada]] Day [[2012]]  
speech:  
Almost exactly two centuries ago, an [[American]] invasion of [[Canada]] was launched.  
Our ancestors, English, [[French]], [[Aboriginal]], people of all backgrounds, joined in the  
fight for [[Canada]].  
It was during the [[War]] of [[1812]]—the [[battle]] for [[Canada]]—that the very foundations of  
this great country of ours were laid.  
A country born in [[French]], a country proud of its cultural diversity, stability and  
prosperity, a country, [[Canada]], that stands apart in North America.  
In fighting together, our ancestors in [[1812]] laid the basis for a common sense of  
[[Canadian]] nationality based on diversity.  
And they laid the basis for the vision of freedom, democracy and justice that is our  
inheritance, [[Canada]], the best country in the world.  
The [[War]] of [[1812]] gives birth to a common sense of [[Canadian]] nationality based on  
diversity. Difference is not itself important, although what differences exist—within  
[[Canada]] and between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]—were the results of the [[War]] of  
[[1812]]: "Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[French]] fact in North America would not be  
protected here in [[Canada]]. Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[Aboriginal]] fact would not  
be protected. Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], [[Canada]] would not have been established in  
[[1867]]."27 [[Canadian]] identity is thus entrenched (and defined) in a particular under  
standing of the source of the [[Canadian]] values that Harper outlines. His under  
standing of the source of these values is made clear in a speech given at the Chief of  
Defence Staff Change of Command ceremony on 29 [[October]] [[2012]]. While one  
might expect that the speech would herald the many contributions of General  
Natynchzyk during his four years as chief of the defence staff, it in fact begins  
by painting a picture of [[Canada]] that finds its origins in the [[War]] of [[1812]]. Speaking  
about the [[Canadian]] military as an institution, Harper points out that:  
Two hundred years ago this year, the first roots of this institution took hold when  
[[Canadian]]s of diverse backgrounds risked, and in many cases, lost their lives in the war  
that firmly established our existence as a separate country.

Turenne Sjolander 16!
```

```
And in every generation since the [[War]] of [[1812]], a special group of citizens, men and
women, have put on the uniform and put themselves in harm's way, so that their
fellow [[Canadian]]s need not.
```

```
It is the institution of the military, the institution through which different
[[Canadian]]s in all their diversity have participated, and the war waged by the mili
tary, which has constructed the nation. As the prime minister reminds us on the
[[1812]] website, "[t]he [[War]] was instrumental in creating [[Canada]]'s armed forces.
Many of our current reserve regiments in [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]], and [[Atlantic]] [[Canada]]
trace their origins back to this time. It was the beginning of a long and proud
military [[history]] in [[Canada]]."29 We are not peacekeepers, we are warriors. This is
not the [[Canada]] of the Nobel Peace Prize, this is the [[Canada]] of bumper stickers
reading "[[War]] of [[1812]]: Been There, Won That."
The unifying nature of this new narrative of [[Canadian]] identity is thus a function
of "everyone" having participated in the war. The loyalty to a coherent and unified
[[Canada]] despite our diversity stems from the loyalty owed to those who ostensibly
fought to protect it between [[1812]] and [[1815]]. Just as the [[death]]s of [[Canadian]] soldiers
in Afghanistan were often mobilized to legitimize [[Canada]]'s continued participation
in the war (to withdraw would have betrayed their sacrifice), so too, the fact that
"[[Canada]]'s diverse peoples" repulsed the [[American]] invasion, with many dying in
the effort, is more than enough to construct a unified [[Canada]] two hundred years
later. As [[Minister]] Moore has been fond of saying, it is "[t]hese heroic efforts" that
"tell the story of today's [[Canada]]."
```

```
[[1812]] and the birth of a distinct [[Canada]]
```

If the [[War]] of [[1812]] constructs [[Canada]] as unified by the very fact of [[Canadian]]  
participation in the war, how does the [[1812]] narrative construct [[Canada]] as distinct,  
notably from the [[United]] [[States]]? At first, the answer seems self-evident. [[Canadian]]s  
are not [[American]]s because [[Canadian]]s "won" the [[War]] of [[1812]]. The war defined, in  
Stephen Harper's words, "what side of the border we live on, and which flag we  
salute." [[Canada]] stood up to the [[American]] invasion. As [[Minister]] Moore put it in  
[[June]] [[2012]], "As [[Canadian]]s, we are used to thinking of our neighbours to the south  
as friends and allies. But, 200 years ago, [[American]] troops stormed our borders.

Thomas Jefferson said the [[American]] invasion would be 'a mere matter of  
marching'... The [[War]] of [[1812]] was the fight for [[Canada]]."32 The pride at having  
proven Jefferson wrong (and the pleasure of quoting his erroneous assessment  
some 200 years later) is evident. Whereas the narrative of internationalism con  
structed [[Canada]]'s distinctiveness on the basis of its "middle power" values, the  
[[1812]] narrative posits that [[Canada]]'s distinctiveness rests on having defeated the  
[[United]] [[States]] in the "fight for [[Canada]]": "The [[War]] of [[1812]]... defined our terri  
torial integrity, defined us differently from the [[United]] [[States]] and was instrumental  
in the creation of our country,"33 Moore explains. The [[1812]] narrative constructs a  
unified [[Canada]] because all of [[Canada]]'s diverse people fought in the war, and a  
distinct [[Canada]] because "we won." The space for political discussion around  
values is limited, because the [[War]] of [[1812]] establishes the facts.  
The Harper [[government]] does not rest here in deploying the [[1812]] narrative. The  
war is also constructed as the catalyst for peace. In the words of the prime minister  
himself, "The signing of the [[Treaty]] of Ghent and other [[treaties]] that followed  
confirmed the border between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]—now the world's  
longest, undefended border and an example of nations coexisting peacefully side by  
side with mutual respect and friendship."34 [[War]] is an instrument that brings sus  
tainable peace, and the implication is clear. Without the [[War]] of [[1812]], [[Canada]]'s  
relations with the [[United]] [[States]] might well be fraught with tensions and challenges.  
The [[War]] of [[1812]] resolved all of that.

```
[[British]]. The [[Canada]] of today, born of the [[War]] of [[1812]], is "an independent and
free country in a constitutional monarchy with its own parliamentary system."35 The
attachment to the Crown, while subtle, marks the [[1812]] narrative and the symbols
supporting it. Graphical representations of the major figures of the war reproduce
their [[British]] military uniforms. The Union Jack is foregrounded, always flying
high. When [[Prime]] [[Minister]] Harper met with [[First]] [[Nations]] leaders at Rideau
Hall to thank them for their contributions to the [[War]] of [[1812]], the Crown was
omnipresent in his remarks:
```

```

valour, [[Aboriginal]] communities were presented with military banners and [[King]]

There is an attachment to a notion of benevolent queen and country which tra  
verses Harper's [[1812]] speeches, nowhere more clearly than in his assertion that "the  
[[War]] helped establish our path toward becoming an independent and free country,  
united under the Crown with a respect for linguistic and ethnic diversity."37 The  
continued diversity of [[Canadian]]s, made possible by the outcome of the [[War]] of  
[[1812]], is a diversity that is articulated within a specific—[[British]]—context. If the  
narrative of internationalism—of a compassionate [[Canada]] engaged with the  
world—was mirrored domestically by the ethos of [[multiculturalism]], the narrative  
of [[1812]] has no such pretenses. Multiculturalism is replaced by an explicit attach  
ment to the [[British]] Crown. Adding the prefix "Royal" to the [[Canadian]] Navy and  
Air Force, as Harper did in [[2011]], is only one manifestation of this narrative.38 The  
[[Canadian]] military, which forged the nation, is a Royal one.

Conclusion: The [[battle]] of the narratives

If the narrative of [[1812]] has tried to recast [[Canadian]] unity and distinctiveness along  
new lines, we must ask about the impacts of such a discursive manoeuvre.39 As I

[[April]] [[2013]]). Nowhere in his speech does Harper allude to the very complicated, and often con
frontational, relationship between [[First]] [[Nations]] peoples and the Crown. For [[First]] [[Nations]] peoples
throughout North America, the [[War]] of [[1812]] was far more a "desperate struggle for freedom and
independence" and a fight "to defend their homelands" than a question of choosing sides—and
certainly not of lining up with the [[British]] to defend [[Canada]] from [[American]] invasion. See "Four

It is important to note that the campaign to celebrate the bicentennial of the [[War]] of [[1812]] was
almost certainly not successful in teaching [[Canadian]]s about the war or its importance. As the
report by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives (cited at the outset of this article) discussed, even during
the height of the [[1812]] celebrations, "the relevance of commemorating the event seemed lost on
almost all" ([[Canadian]] Press, "Few [[Canadian]]s aware"). Nonetheless, the extent to which
[[Canadian]]s learned, or indeed, cared, about the [[War]] of [[1812]], despite the expenditures of millions
of dollars, is in some respect beside the point. The messages about [[Canada]] that the Harper gov
ernment associated with the celebration of the [[War]] of [[1812]]—messages that appear in other cam
paigns in other contexts—transcend the specifics of this one effort at commemoration.

have argued elsewhere, understood as part of the process of constructing and  
reinforcing a specific [[Canadian]] identity, the use of the internationalist narrative  
has not been without its consequences.40 If [[Canada]] is unusually virtuous and moral  
on the world stage, this necessarily implies that others are not quite as virtuous or  
possessing of the same moral superiority. A claim of being a uniquely virtuous or  
moral nation both casts [[Canadian]] domestic politics as uniquely harmonious and  
egalitarian (for such a virtuous moral posture internationally surely must be the  
result of a uniquely moral society domestically) and projects an imperial project  
abroad: in constructing [[Canada]] as noble, virtuous, and laudable, foreign "others"  
are necessarily constructed as less noble and virtuous.  
The [[1812]] narrative also clearly seeks to project [[Canadian]] authority internation  
ally by casting [[Canada]] as a prudent but potentially belligerent country. As Harper  
has made clear, [[Canadian]] foreign policy would not reflect the "soft pacifist" views  
associated by Conservative supporters with Liberal internationalism. No longer  
would the purpose of [[Canada]]'s foreign policy be "just to go along and get along  
with everyone else's agenda. It is no longer to please every dictator with a vote at  
the [[United]] [[Nations]]."41 Far from the helpful fixer posture associated with peace  
keeping, [[Canada]] would not seek to mediate a resolution to conflicts, but would  
rather choose sides wisely and be prepared to fight.  
The [[1812]] narrative also acts to cast [[Canada]]'s domestic sphere in a more com  
bative light. The [[War]] of [[1812]] defines [[Canada]] in the context of a political project,  
but one that is exclusionary as much as it is inclusionary (both rhetorically and in  
practice)—for it is the project of Empire. While Harper's speeches remind us of the  
participation of the [[French]] and the [[First]] [[Nations]] in prosecuting the [[War]] of [[1812]],  
they are integrated as subjects of the Crown, rather than as actors in their own  
right, with their own claims against the [[American]]s. While the rhetoric of inter  
nationalism conceals an imperialism which is outwardly directed (if [[Canadian]]s are  
morally superior, that moral superiority is exercised with respect to someone), the  
new rhetoric of [[1812]] constructs an imperialism which is both powerfully internal  
(one nation under the [[British]] Crown) and external ([[Canadian]]s are right to fight  
wars because [[Canada]] was "born out of conflict" and [[Canada]]'s glory was and is  
proven through war).  
This new rhetoric is also powerfully gendered, because war—and certainly the  
[[War]] of [[1812]]—is man's work. The willingness to fight, to prove oneself superior to  
the [[American]] invaders, the glory of the ultimate sacrifice—the ideal [[Canadian]] in  
the service of the nation—is constructed along a model of militarized masculinity.  
Women are nearly invisible in this new narrative, despite the efforts of the Harper  
[[government]] to appear inclusive. That effort is focused first on the figure of Laura  
Secord, who fulfils the role in the [[1812]] narrative of "standing in" for all women

and of allowing the Harper [[government]] to claim that the [[1812]] discourse is inclusive
of everyone. The "official" story of Laura Secord is worthy of a close look:
```

```
Laura Secord's adventures started when her husband, James Secord, a sergeant in the
1st Lincoln militia, was wounded early on in the [[War]] of [[1812]]. She managed to rescue
him from the [[battle]]field during the [[battle]] of [[Queen]]ston Heights...
```

```
In [[June]] of [[1813]], [[Queen]]ston was still occupied by [[American]] troops when James and
Laura Secord were forced to host some [[American]] officers in their home. That's when
she overheard the [[American]]s plan to surprise the [[British]] outpost at Beaver Dams and
capture the officer in charge, Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. Her husband, given his
injuries, was unable to deliver this message to the [[British]] so she set out to do it herself.
The direct route to the outpost was 12 miles (about 20 kilometres), and Laura was
worried that she would encounter [[American]] guards on her way there. She decided it
would be better to travel through fields and forests; it wasn't easy and when she finally
arrived, she was exhausted.
```

```
After she crossed the Twelve Mile [[Cree]]k on a fallen tree, Laura was surprised to come
upon a [[First]] [[Nations]]' encampment. Once her mission was explained, the chief took
her directly to FitzGibbon. Two days later, [[American]] troops were ambushed near
Beaver Dams by [[First]] [[Nations]] warriors. FitzGibbon then persuaded the much larger
[[American]] forces to surrender.
```

##### In this [[War]] of [[1812]] biography, Laura Secord is the perfect—and per

```
fectly—militarized wife. She is an admirable helpmate to her soldier husband,
arguably going beyond the call of duty in rescuing him from the [[battle]]field. She
cares for him and tends to his injuries. Once she overhears the plans of the
[[American]] soldiers, she decides she must warn the [[British]], but only because her
husband cannot do so as a result of his wounds. She is the Rosie the Riveter of the
[[War]] of [[1812]]—assuming a temporary duty because her husband cannot. The hier
archy of love—for god, country, and home—is revealed, as she sets out on a dan
gerous mission because loyalty to the ([[British]]) state is a higher calling, more
important that her own safety or that of her wounded husband.
Laura Secord is one of only two women given preeminence in the [[1812]] narrative,
although the one woman deemed to be a major figure. The second woman featured
in the Harper [[government]]'s recounting of the war is Mary Henry, and her role is
even more characteristic of the gendered hierarchies necessary to construct militar
ized masculinity. During a particularly fierce [[battle]] in [[May]] [[1813]], a large [[American]]
army made an amphibious assault on Niagara, landing not far from the lighthouse

where Henry's husband, a retired artillery gunner, was the keeper. Throughout the  
landing and the extremely heavy [[bomb]]ardment, casualties were numerous with half  
the [[British]] and [[Canadian]]s [[kill]]ed or wounded. During this entire action, Mary  
Henry walked the [[battle]]field, bringing coffee and food to the troops and tending  
to the wounded, as though "guarded by some unseen angel from the peril which  
menaced her every step."44 Mary Henry is the ultimate nurse, bringing food and  
comfort to the troops. Her role, while celebrated, is supportive—of the men in  
[[battle]], and of the state which wages war. Neither Mary Henry nor Laura Secord  
raise questions about state policy nor do they advocate solutions other than war.  
The near invisibility of women, their silent support for a nation at war, their  
selfless support of the men (and the state) that prosecute the war—these gender  
roles are replicated in the controversy surrounding the unveiling of the design  
finalists for the [[War]] of [[1812]] memorial which will find pride of place as a permanent  
fixture on Parliament Hill. The terms of reference for the design of the memorial  
required that the proposals represent seven distinct groups: the [[British]] Army, the  
[[British]] Navy, the Provincial Marine, the English-speaking militia, the [[French]]  
speaking militia, [[First]] [[Nations]], and Métis.45 Of the two shortlisted statues, only  
one displays a woman—caring for a wounded soldier in the background.46 If war  
confirms the glory of the nation, women are not central to that project. The nar  
rative of [[1812]] confirms that foreign policy is man's work.  
Whereas the rhetoric of internationalism depoliticizes [[Canada]]'s wars (by con  
structing them as peacekeeping or the work of the good international citizen—and  
therefore always right), the rhetoric of [[1812]] gives pride of place to [[Canada]]'s mili  
tary and a particular Manichaean understanding of world politics. This under

##### standing tries to reframe the way in which two basic elements of the

```
internationalist discourse functions: [[Canadian]]s are unified (because we participated
in our diversity in the war under the [[British]] Crown, which is our real heritage) and
we are distinct from the [[United]] [[States]] (because we won, and because we are

##### [[British]]). Declaring the military to be a "Royal" institution and ordering

[[Canadian]] embassies, high commissions, and consulates abroad to display pictures  
of the [[Queen]]47 reaffirm this understanding of the world and [[Canada]]'s place within

see the [[War]] of [[1812]] through Stephen Harper's looking glass.
