Abstract

Taking a transnational approach, this essay explores the dynamic circuits of glob
[[racism]]s, resistance, and imperial politics that obliged [[Canadian]] policymakers t
secure racist exclusions while simultaneously obscuring them. The case studies exam
ined in this essay—[[British]] Columbia's denial of the franchise to [[First]] [[Nations]] an
[[Chinese]], adoption of the Natal Act, and the comprehensive federal exclusions adopted

after the [[1907]] [[white]] race riots in [[Vancouver]]—illustrate how racist immigration policie

both provincial and federal, had to take into account resistance and international factor

as perceived by the [[British]] Colonial Office. Taken in conjunction with [[Indigenous]] his

tory, the [[history]] of transpacific migration to [[Canada]] offers important insights into th

role of [[white]] supremacy in a colonial settler state such as [[Canada]].

Wherever we turn, we are confronted by [[Canada]]'s colonial past: Idle No More,
court decisions regarding land claims, the [[murdered]] women inquiry, and revela
tions about residential schools and scientific [[[[experiment]]s]] on [[First]] [[Nations]] peoples
are constant reminders of the country's colonial legacy. The revelations of social
[[history]] regarding indigeneity, patriarchy, and elitism are like burrs in the saddle of
traditionalists—irritatingly disrupting the narrative of [[Canada]]'s smooth transition
from [[colony]] to nation.

Seldom integrated into the critique, however, are the intersections of social his
tory with the politics of race and [[empire]]. As legal historian Constance Backhouse

reminds us, [[Canada]]'s political and academic landscape is marked by an "ideology
of racelessness."1 Fortunately, postcolonial scholars have begun to address these
questions, and there is a greater focus on the intersections of gender, class, and
race. This essay offers a postcolonial perspective on the local/global connections in

[[Canadian]] [[history]] with particular focus on how transpacific events and relation
ships shaped the country. The emerging [[history]] of [[Pacific]] [[Canada]] supplements the
growing understanding of [[Indigenous]] [[history]] and its aftermath. Together, the two
illuminate how [[colonialism]] and [[racism]] came together to fundamentally shape both

[[Canada]] and the modern world. Paradoxically, probing this difficult terrain also
allows us to identify alternative role models in all communities, the lived lives that
illuminate paths to a better future.

Indigeneity and [[Pacific]] [[Canada]]
[[Canada]]'s consolidation as a [[white]] settler state was not pre-ordained: on the [[Pacific]]
edges of the [[empire]] there was for many years a great mingling of peoples.2 There,

[[Europe]]ans were a minority in the pre-confederation era. However, racial anxieties
and the desire of male, [[British]] elites to consolidate control soon gave birth to the
demand for a "White" [[Canada]].

Thus, in [[1872]], when the new province of [[British]] Columbia's provincial legisla
ture convened, a sharp debate focused on whether male voters had to be able to
read. In an attempt to enlarge their support among [[white]]s, the legislators had
eliminated [[property]] ownership as a qualification for voting; but for some, the
literacy requirement was a means by which to restrict [[aboriginal]] and [[Chinese]] resi
dents from voting. As one early legislator put it, he did "not wish to put ourselves

shoulder to shoulder with the untutored savage. He thought our position with
respect to the [[Indian]]s was very anomalous."3
Another opponent of removing the literacy requirement went further, asserting,

"we might, after next election, see an [[Indian]] occupying the Speaker's Chair, or
have a [[Chinese]] majority in the House."4 The vote to eliminate the literacy require
ment passed 12 to nine. What turned the tide was the suggestion that another way

could be found to prevent the "others" from voting. A statute excluding "[[Indian]]s
and [[Chinese]]" from registering vital statistics (births, [[death]]s, and marriages) had
been debated the day before (clarifying that "any person with any [[white]] blood in
his veins was not an [[Indian]]") and passed third reading earlier in the afternoon.
With that exclusion already on the books as a precedent, the 21 legislators easily
and unanimously passed a subsequent bill "excluding" the [[Indian]]s and [[Chinese]]
from voting.5 And so it was that [[property]]less and illiterate [[white]] men gained the

right to vote, and BC's others, the [[Chinese]] and "[[Indian]]" males, saw their franchise
taken way. Racial categories and exclusions that had begun as a [[white]]-[[Indigenous]]
binary had expanded, adding to strong gender biases.
The legislators who passed this bill expressed noble sentiments of equality with

the poor and illiterate and believed that they were very much on the side of the
angels. But this was not egalitarianism so much as racial solidarity in an age of

anxiety, when "[[white]]" [[Canadian]]s numbered about 20,000 in the face of an
[[Aboriginal]] population of 45,000.6 As migration from Asia continued, so too did
racial hardening. [[Japanese]] and South Asians were added to [[Indian]]s and [[Chinese]] on
the list of those ineligible to vote. In the eyes of the law, all Asians became part of

the unassimilable other. And although women had begun to lobby for the fran
chise, they did so only for [[white]] women.

Throughout this process, [[First]] [[Nations]] and those of Asian heritage, often with
support from allies, challenged [[white]] supremacy in various ways. For example,
in [[1900]], Tomey Homma, a naturalized [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]], challenged the ban
on voting. After he won in the BC courts, the BC [[government]] appealed to the
[[British]] Privy Council and the justices ruled against him.7 The judgment relied on
precedents regarding the exclusion of women from voting and US law designed to
"accommodate the demands of slave states to preserve local control over the attri
butes of citizenship in order to maintain racial boundaries."8 The BC and [[British]]
[[government]]s relied on the biases of gender and race to enforce the politics of [[white]]
supremacy.

Resistance such as Tomey Homma's and [[Indigenous]] assertions of fishing and
hunting rights prompted further measures of control. Taking the "[[Indian]] out of the

[[child]]" in residential schools, created by virtue of the [[1876]] [[Indian]] Act, was one
solution. Stopping Asians from coming to [[Canada]] altogether was another.

Globalizing exclusions
In the winter of [[1908]], two [[Japanese]] men attempting to land in [[Vancouver]] were
arrested and detained under the terms of the [[British]] Columbia Immigration Act.
They contested their detention in an appeal to the BC Supreme Court. In his ruling

of 21 [[February]], Justice C.J. Hunter noted that the two men were "subjects of the
Emperor of Japan" and questioned the validity of the BC legislation "which I shall
refer to as the Natal Act."9 Why would a judge refer to a provincial law as the

Natal Act when Natal was in [[Africa]]? A close examination reveals that a global

circuit existed for the construction of racist exclusions.10

Between [[1887]] and [[1937]], the [[British]] [[government]] convened 15 colonial and
imperial conferences. '1 At these conferences, the [[British]] secretary of state for the

colonies met with the prime ministers of [[Canada]], [[New]] South Wales, Victoria,

[[New]] [[Zealand]], [[Queen]]sland, Cape Colony, South [[Australia]], [[New]]foundland,
Tasmania, [[Western]] [[Australia]], and Natal. This was a [[white]] man's club of the settler

colonies with the other "coloured" colonies unrepresented. One of the main topics
of discussion at the [[1897]] conference was "Alien Immigration" and, in addressing
the subject, Joseph Chamberlain remarked, "We quite sympathize with the deter
mination of the [[white]] inhabitants of these Colonies which are in comparatively
close proximity to millions and hundreds of millions of Asiatics that there shall not
be an in[[flu]]x of people alien in civilization, alien in religion, alien in customs, whose
in[[flu]]x, moreover, would most seriously interfere with the legitimate rights of the

existing labour population."12 Chamberlain cautioned, however, that overt dis
crimination could cause problems:
The [[[[United]]]] [[King]]dom owns as its brightest and greatest dependency that enormous
Empire of India, with 300,000,000 of subjects, who are as loyal to the Crown as you

are yourselves, and among them there are hundreds and thousands of men who are
every bit as civilized as we are ourselves, who are, if that is anything, better born in the

sense that they have older traditions and old families, who are men of wealth, men of

cultivation, men of distinguished valour, men who have brought whole armies and
placed them at the service of the [[Queen]], and have in times of great difficulty and
trouble, such as for instance on the occasion of the India Mutiny, saved the [[empire]] by
their loyalty.13

To avoid giving offence, Chamberlain suggested, assertions of racial difference were
to be avoided: "It is not because a man is of a different colour from ourselves that

he is necessarily an undesirable immigrant, but it is because he is dirty, or is
immoral, or he is a pauper, or he has some other objection which can be defined
in an Act of Parliament, and by which the exclusion can be managed with regard to

all those whom you really desire to exclude." This, Chamberlain emphasized, had
been achieved in Natal, where they had adopted legislation that required Asian
immigrants to undergo a language exam. This legislation allowed an immigration
officer to impose a proficiency test in a [[Europe]]an language on arriving South Asian
10. For details on Natal, see Jeremy Martens, "A transnational [[history]] of immigration restriction:

immigrants, and it became a benchmark colour screen for [[British]] colonies, includ
ing [[Canada]], acknowledged by public officials throughout the [[empire]]. Obscuring
[[racism]] while securing racist exclusions became a hallmark of the [[British]] Empire.
This case also highlights how the BC immigration bills (Natal Acts) were not
simply local outbursts of local nativism but rather part of an intricate and global
web of [[white]] supremacy in the settler colonies, coordinated through the Colonial
Office in London. Indeed, Joseph Chamberlain had communicated directly with
[[Canadian]] [[representative]]s on the need to emulate the Natal Act.14 Further research

has shown that the Natal Act was modelled on US "Jim Crow" legislation in
Mississippi. Prevented from disenfranchising [[Africa]]n [[American]]s because of the

14th and 15th Constitutional Amendments passed during the civil war, the
Mississippi Constitutional Convention passed a literacy test that could be used

to limit voting. [[British]] legal scholar and future ambassador to [[Washington]]
James Bryce (author of The [[American]] Commonwealth) transmitted this precedent
to [[British]] colonial officials in southern [[Africa]] and later reported that the Cape had
introduced a literacy test to limit [[Africa]]n voting rights.15 From the [[American]] south

to [[Africa]], from London to [[British]] Columbia, [[Britain]]'s Colonial Office managed to
globalize [[white]] supremacy on an unprecedented scale.
Limiting Asian immigration had begun in [[1885]] with the imposition of a head tax
on [[Chinese]] migrants. This exacerbated gender issues, and [[Chinese]] women had little
opportunity to join their migrant husbands. By [[1908]], the federal [[government]] had
expanded the gendered and racist restrictions into a differential yet comprehensive
system for excluding Asians. Thus, for imperial Japan, a "Gentleman's Agreement"
was reached in [[1908]] limiting [[Japanese]] immigration. For South Asia, the [[government]]
used administrative orders-in-council (including the infamous Continuous Journey
Act) because of [[British]] fears that overtly racist prohibitions would fuel anti-[[British]]
agitation in India. And in the case of [[China]], regarded as the "sick man of Asia," the
[[Canadian]] [[government]] employed blatantly discriminatory measures, including the
head tax and the eventual outright ban on [[Chinese]] immigration in [[1923]].
From the beginning, Asian [[Canadian]]s fought these restrictions. In [[1885]], the
[[Chinese]] Consolidated Benevolent Association was formed in Victoria to contest

the head tax. And in [[1914]], the Indo-[[Canadian]] communities in BC came together t
[[protest]] the [[government]]'s refusal to allow the 376 [[Indian]] passengers on board th
Komagata Maru to disembark when the ship arrived in [[Vancouver]]. Among the
leaders of the support movement were Rahim Hussein and J.E. Bird, who set

important precedents in [[white]]-Asian solidarity. Neither is acknowledged i

[[Canadian]] [[history]].
The measures to exclude Asians, and similar measures taken to exclude those o
[[Africa]]n heritage, assured [[white]] domination. However, preventing Asian immigr
tion also reduced the pool for labour and for settlement. [[Canada]] opened its door
to eastern and southern [[Europe]]ans, groups that hitherto had been considered

second-class [[white]]s. The [[gold]]en age of immigration under the Liberals' Clifford
Sifton was predicated on Asian exclusion.

Twinning the [[empire]]s
[[Australia]]n historians Marilyn Lake and Henry Reynolds have posited that
"In Iraq, the [[[[United]]]] [[States]], [[Britain]] and [[Australia]] fight together in a 'coalition of
the willing' that recapitulates the Anglo-Saxon solidarity of earlier times with
devastating consequences."16 The scope of its international [[alliance]]s is extensive,
but at the core we find that the US [[empire]] remains wedded to a concept of the West
that has at its centre the historically constructed [[alliance]]s rooted in the opaque but

deeply racialized notions of Anglo-Saxonism.
[[Canada]] declined to participate in the invasion of Iraq (a point I will return to
later). Yet its role historically in constructing the Anglo-[[American]] [[alliance]] was
significant and rooted in the politics of [[racism]].

Immediately after the anti-Asian race riots in [[Vancouver]] in [[1907]], the [[Canadian]]

[[government]] found itself squeezed between London and [[Washington]].17
In [[November]], Rodolphe Lemieux, [[Canada]]'s postmaster general and minister of
labour, crossed the [[Pacific]] to [[Tokyo]] in what was arguably [[Canada]]'s first autono
mous foray into overseas diplomacy. Upon arrival in [[Tokyo]], Lemieux first solicited

the support of the [[British]] ambassador, Sir Claude Mac[[Donald]], in negotiating
immigration restrictions. Mac[[Donald]], upon receiving instructions from London,
offered to back Lemieux for "all he was worth." However, Lemieux rebuffed an
appeal from the US ambassador to Japan, Thomas J. O'Brien, to join in the nego

tiations with Lemieux and Mac[[Donald]] in [[Tokyo]]. O'Brien had been tasked by
[[President]] Theodore Roosevelt to negotiate similar emigration restrictions to the
US in the aftermath of the San Francisco school board crisis of [[1906]]. Roosevelt,

infuriated by how events unfolded in [[Tokyo]], summoned Mackenzie [[King]], then
deputy minister of labour, to the White House in [[February]] [[1908]] where he told

[[King]] that Lemieux's "ostentatious refusal to have anything to do with the

[[American]] ambassador had done harm to the situation."18

This incident prompted Roosevelt to recruit [[King]] to work toward a hemispheric

agreement to exclude Asians. It also led him to send the US "Great White Fleet"
around the world with the particular goal of intimidating Japan. "The [[Japanese]]
must learn," Roosevelt believed, "that they will have to keep their people in their

own country."19 White [[Canada]]'s common interest with the US in excluding
[[Japanese]] was but the beginning of [[Canada]]'s role in welding together the old
[[empire]] and the new.

The [[Canadian]] [[government]] worked assiduously with the [[British]] and [[American]]
[[government]]s to police South Asian immigration.20 This collaboration began with
[[Ottawa]] hiring a former [[British]] [[Indian]] policeman, William Hopkinson, to spy on
South Asian communities on both sides of the border.21 Faced with systemic dis
crimination in both [[Canada]] and the US, activists quickly drew the connections
between [[white]] supremacy on the [[Pacific]] coast and [[British]] control of India, culmi

nating in the founding of the [[revolution]]ary Ghadar Party in [[1913]]. [[British]],
[[Canadian]], and US agencies worked collaboratively to both restrict immigration
from India and harass the anti-colonial activities of the Ghadar movement.22 Upon

joining the [[British]] and [[Canadian]]s in the [[First]] World [[War]], the US [[government]]
cracked down on South Asian activists and their sympathizers and, working closely
with the [[British]], tried 14 [[Indian]] activists and their supporters for their attempts to

promote uprisings in India against [[British]] control in what became known as the
"Hindu Conspiracy" trial.23 The emerging [[British]]-[[American]] global collaboration
prompted anti-colonial activists Taraknath Das and Sailendra Ghose to conclude
that their struggle was not just against [[British]] rule in India but against "Anglo
Saxon" imperialism, putting a name to the new [[alliance]].24 [[Canada]] also supported
US and [[British]] efforts to veto Japan's proposed racial equality clause at Versailles.
Perhaps the most important example of [[Canada]]'s commitment to facilitating
Anglo-[[American]] supremacy was its policy in the [[Pacific]]. On 15 [[February]] [[1921]], the
[[Canadian]] prime minister, Arthur Meighen, wrote to the [[British]] prime minister
arguing strenuously that further renewal of the Anglo-[[Japanese]] [[alliance]], first estab

lished in [[1902]], risked alienating the [[[[United]]]] [[States]] [[government]]: "There is a danger
that a special confidential relationship concerning the [[[Pacific]]] region between our
selves and Japan to which she was not a party would come to be regarded as an
unfriendly exclusion and as a barrier to an English speaking concord." He con
cluded: "We should terminate the Alliance and endeavor at once to bring about a

Conference of [[Pacific]] Powers... for the purpose of adjusting [[Pacific]] and Far
[[Eastern]] questions." 25
A few months later, Meighen travelled to London for the imperial conference
(prime ministers' conference) of [[June]]-[[July]] [[1921]]. He argued formidably for an end

to the [[alliance]] and the convening instead of the [[Washington]] Conference
20. This period is documented in chapter 2 of Reg Whitaker, Gregory S. Kealey, and Andrew
Parnaby, Secret Service: Political Policing in [[Canada]] from the Fenians to Fortress America

in [[November]]. Historians differ on Meighen's personal impact, but there is no
denying that at the [[Washington]] Conference, the Anglo-[[Japanese]] [[alliance]] came
to an end, replaced by the four-power [[treaty]] (US, [[British]] Empire, Japan, and
[[France]]) in which Japan was rendered a junior partner to Anglo-[[American]] hegem
ony in the [[Pacific]]. This and further US and [[Canadian]] immigrations restrictions
against [[Japanese]] from [[1923]] to [[1928]] provided real grist for the propaganda mill and
fired the [[Japanese]] imperial imagination.

When first confronted with the [[Japanese]] invasion of [[China]] in [[1937]], [[Canada]]'s
prime minister Mackenzie [[King]] mused, "The animal instincts are asserting them
selves, & are best left to work themselves out, & others to abstain therefrom. It is

an appaling [sic] world situation—but not worth the lives of [[white]] men for
'Business Interests.'"26 Appeasement began long before Munich, and [[racism]] was
a contributing factor. Such views prompted Hugh Keenleyside, a secretary in
[[Canada]]'s [[Tokyo]] embassy at the time, to remark that the "inscrutability of the
Orient and the 'oriental mentality' were largely a fiction of lazy minds."27

By the [[1930]]s, support for racial stereotyping was waning even among [[white]]s,
yet the institutional underpinnings of [[white]] supremacy remained unchanged.
This would create a dilemma for muscular coloniality in a time of crisis.

The paradoxes of change
The [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]] experience during the Second World [[War]] is important not
because it paints [[Canada]] in a negative light but rather because it highlights import

ant paradoxes in [[Canadian]] [[history]]. [[Canadian]] identity is often tied to being differ
ent from the [[[[United]]]] [[States]]—for example, we supposedly have a more benign past.
Yet the persecution of [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s exceeded [[Washington]]'s ill [[treatment]] of
[[Japanese]] [[American]]s. In [[Canada]], not only were all [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s uprooted
from their homes but their [[property]] and worldly goods were seized and sold off.
Such a seizure did not occur in the US. [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s were not allowed to

join the armed forces; [[Japanese]] [[American]]s were. [[Japanese]] [[American]]s began
returning to their coastal communities beginning in early [[1945]], before the war
ended; the [[Canadian]] [[government]] tried to deport [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s and, failing
that, prevented them from returning to the coast until [[1949]].

Yet in early 1942, the feminist Nellie McClung, who had moved to Victoria in
[[1935]], wrote a feature piece in the Victoria Daily Times Magazine in which she
argued that the "[[Canadian]] [[Japanese]] are not to blame for the treacherous attack
on Pearl Harbor," and that it was a time to respect human rights and democracy.28

"We must have precautions, but not persecutions," she asserted. A number of
others also raised their voices against the uprooting of [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s, but
to no avail. Herein lies a paradox of [[history]].

The hegemony of the racist state was breaking down as ordinary people were
changing their views regarding Asian [[Canadian]]s. Intermingling, Co-operative
Commonwealth Federation campaigns for the franchise, and other factors had
created a wellspring of empathy. Thus, when colonial masculinity tried to demonize

[[Japanese]]-[[Canadian]]s in a time of crisis, as occurred in the male-dominated provin
cial legislature and Victoria City Council in early 1942, it met resistance. The result

was a vitriolic campaign against [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s that silenced the opposition
and led to the cataclysmic uprooting described above.
Although [[Canada]] took longer than the US to end its attack on its [[Japanese]] citi
zens, as wartime fears dissipated and the brutality of the Nazis became apparent,
fewer people were willing to buy into the [[racism]]s of the past. Thus, Victoria City
Council's [[1945]] appeal to exile all [[Japanese]] [[Canadian]]s to Japan after the war found
little support when sent to other municipalities. A few years after the war, the [[Chinese]]

Exclusion Act was repealed, and Asian [[Canadian]]s gained the franchise. This rapid
volte-face could have occurred only because attitudes had already begun to change.

Reinventing the "West"
In post-war international affairs, global decolonization meant that overt [[racism]]
had to be contained. Winston Churchill's speech in Fulton, Missouri is famous for
its "iron curtain" reference, but [[history]] has forgotten his call at that time for a
continuing [[alliance]] of the "English-speaking peoples" under [[American]] leadership.
The Cold [[War]] and the politics of anti-communism reinvented and enlarged the
Anglo-[[American]] imperial quest in the name of the "West."
Through its support of [[NATO]], NORAD, and its reluctant participation in the
[[Korea]]n [[War]], [[Canada]]'s post-war Liberal [[government]] proved its worth as a US ally.

It became part of the core, of an Anglo-[[American]] bloc within an enlarged
[[alliance]]—Pax [[American]]a. Yet the need to nurture a distinct [[Canadian]] identity
prompted the federal [[government]] to display some degree of autonomy, and
[[Ottawa]] often proclaimed its solidarity with newly independent states. This stance
was recognized by countries such as India and [[China]] when they nominated [[Canada]]
to serve on the International Control Commission for [[Vietnam]] at the Geneva con

ference initially in [[1954]]. [[Canada]]'s role here had the unintended consequence of
allowing the [[Canadian]] [[government]] to forego troop deployment to Asia in support
of the US war in Indochina. It laid the groundwork for [[Canadian]] peacekeeping and
strong support for the UN, values that many [[Canadian]]s regarded as an integral part
of their identity. The massive demonstrations against the invasion of Iraq in [[Quebec]]
and the rest of [[Canada]] in [[2003]] reflected this tradition and created the space for the

Chrétien [[government]] to reject US appeals for [[Canadian]] participation in the inva
sion.29 Not surprisingly, peacekeeping and the UN quickly became the target of the

Conservative Party of [[Canada]]'s muscular nationalism.

29. To be sure, the Liberal [[government]] supported US intervention in other ways, including military
involvement in Afghanistan, a move that became the thin edge of the wedge for the Conservatives
once they came to power.

Persistent lobbying on the part of Asian [[Canadian]]s and their allies, including
Asian countries and newly independent countries of the Caribbean, finally put an
end to racist immigration preferences in [[1967]]. However, by that time [[white]] [[Canada]]

was reproducing itself exponentially. Euro-[[Canadian]]s increased by 6.5 million
between [[1941]] and [[1961]], those of Asian heritage by just 48,000.30 Over 1 million
[[Europe]]an refugees came to [[Canada]] after the Second World [[War]] while Asian refu
gees continued to be excluded.31
Only now are we beginning to see the dramatic changes in demographics
brought about by immigration reform. This process accompanied but remained
quite distinct from the nationalism of [[Quebec]]'s Quiet Revolution that gave birth to

[[multiculturalism]] in the [[1970]]s and [[1980]]s. Even 30 years after the introduction of
[[multiculturalism]], and despite major demographic shifts apparent in large cities, the

legacies of [[white]] supremacy and [[colonialism]] continue to haunt [[Canada]].
[[First]] [[Nations]] peoples experience this legacy daily, and their resistance often
strips away [[Canada]]'s liberal veneer, revealing a deep-seated and virulent [[racism]].
Nor has anti-Asian [[racism]] disappeared—consider the contortions the Bank of
[[Canada]] went through to justify not depicting an Asian woman on the new $100
bill, or the accusations by the head of the [[Canadian]] Security Intelligence Service
([[CSIS]]) that [[Chinese]]-[[Canadian]] politicians were agents of the [[Chinese]] [[government]].
The temporary foreign workers program adds another layer to a segmented job
market in which people of colour continue to be channelled into lower-paying
service jobs.
Eurocentrism continues to dominate our education system. As Luke Clossey of
Simon Fraser [[University]] and his colleagues recently demonstrated, 85 per cent of
historians at [[Canadian]] universities still teach [[Canadian]], [[Europe]]an, or [[American]]
[[history]]. The histories of 85 per cent of the world's population remain on the
periphery.32

Despite [[Canada]]'s decision to opt out of the invasion of Iraq, continuing eco
nomic integration with the US assured [[Canadian]] participation in the US-led war
on terror. The [[treatment]] of Omar Khadr, the [[Canadian]] [[child]] soldier, is only the
latest example of Islamophobia that has accompanied this campaign and led to the
harassment of Arab/Muslim communities.
Five years ago in this journal, Henry Yu outlined the great potential that [[Pacific]]

[[Canada]] offered.33 A younger generation is prepared for change, but whether we

can move forward depends on whether we can shed a past in which [[white]]ness
became the standard and everything and everyone was measured against it. The
histories of [[indigenous]] peoples, Asian [[Canadian]]s, and their many allies are part of
a global process of decolonization that offers us valuable lessons—and opportu
nities to reshape our destiny.
