[[Saskatchewan]] is known as the “land of the living skies” for its breathtakingly 
colourful northern lights. It is also one of the most beautiful 
prairie-provinces in [[Canada]], with stunning purple sand beaches and the 
incredible Sahara-like Athabasca Sand Dunes that stretch for nearly 100 
kilometres. The province also boasts over 100,000 lakes and rivers, making it 
nearly 12% water. The diverse [[Indigenous]] Nations which have thrived on these 
territories since time immemorial have tied their customs, practices and 
traditions, and even their traditional [[Indigenous]] knowledge systems to the 
life-giving resources from these rich lands, waters and eco-systems. The very 
land that has sustained the Nehiyaw, Anishinabe and other Nations for thousands 
of years is firmly rooted in their identity as individuals, families, and 
Nations. Sadly, [[Saskatchewan]] is also well-known as one of the most racist 
provinces in [[Canada]]. With colonization and the clearing of the plains, came 
brutal acts of genocide, land dispossession and violent [[racism]] against First 
Nations – a legacy that has and continues to be a lethal reality for First 
Nations.
 
 
[[Saskatchewan]] is the home to farmer Gerald Stanley, who shot and [[kill]]ed an 
unarmed First Nation youth, Colten Boushie, in cold blood in [[2016]], but was found
not guilty by an all-[[white]] jury two years later – a result that shocked the 
nation. But it’s not just [[white]] farmers [[kill]]ing [[Indigenous]] peoples – 62.5% of 
people who died from police encounters in [[Saskatchewan]] were [[Indigenous]], despite 
being only 11% of the population. But this should not come as a shock to anyone.
It wasn’t that long ago in [[2004]] that the Neil Stone[[child]] Inquiry exposed the 
[[Saskatchewan]] police practice known as “Starlight Tours” to the world. Starlight 
Tours occur when police officers detain [[Indigenous]] youth, drive them out of town
and leave them stranded in sub-zero temperatures causing their [[death]]s. While 
this racist practice was well-known by First Nations as common practice, [[Canada]] 
had a hard time accepting the persistence, prevalence and lethal nature of 
[[racism]] in this country. Meanwhile, the rate of [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] 
women and girls continued to climb.
 
 
In 2[[014]], the Royal [[Canadian]] Mounted Police (RCMP) released a report on the 
“known” cases of [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women and girls in [[Canada]] which
showed that [[Indigenous]] women and girls make up only 2.5% of the [[Canadian]] 
population, but 16% of the murder victims in [[Canada]]. However, [[Saskatchewan]] had 
the highest provincial rates - 55% of all murders of women were [[Indigenous]]. This
unique intersection of [[racism]] and [[misogyny]] creates a situation where sexualized 
[[violence]] is perpetrated against [[Indigenous]] women and girls at alarming rates 
with relative impunity, and by all walks of society. While it is true that 
domestic [[violence]] is part of the issue, many of the murders and acts of 
sexualized [[violence]] were committed by society – doctors, lawyers, teachers, 
judges, social workers, [[foster]] parents and even police officers. Human Rights 
Watch released a report about police officers in [[Saskatchewan]] who commit 
sexualized [[violence]] against [[Indigenous]] women and girls in their custody, 
including sexual harassment, assault, invasive strip searches by male officers, 
and groping.
 
 
Racialized [[violence]], abuse and neglect of First Nations is so ingrained in 
[[Saskatchewan]] that it is not only reflected in societal attitudes, but those of 
its governing bodies and agencies. Nowhere are the socio-economic conditions 
worse for First Nations than in the sister provinces of [[Manitoba]] and 
[[Saskatchewan]]. More than 80% of all [[child]]ren in care in [[Saskatchewan]] are 
[[Indigenous]] – second only to [[Manitoba]]’s 90% - primarily due to discriminatory 
agency practices or conditions of [[poverty]] from chronic and discriminatory 
[[government]] under-funding of core social services. [[Racism]] has a multiplier effect
where not only are [[Indigenous]] [[child]]ren wrongly apprehended, but because of that 
race-based apprehension, they are less likely to get a high school education, 
and more likely to end up in youth corrections. More than 2/3 of all [[Indigenous]] 
peoples in [[prison]] were in the [[child]] [[welfare]] system. It should be no surprise 
then that [[Indigenous]] [[foster]] girls are also over-represented in [[murdered]], 
[[missing]], and sex trafficked and those exploited in the [[child]] porn industry. 
Human traffickers know exactly where to get them - [[foster]] and group homes.
 
 
These multiple, over-lapping crises rooted in [[racism]] and [[violence]] against 
[[Indigenous]] peoples is getting worse. The Supreme Court of [[Canada]], the federal 
Office of the Correctional Investigator, the Auditor General, [[child]] [[welfare]] 
advocates, and numerous [[United]] Nations human rights bodies, together with 
countless [[research]] findings, commissions, inquiries and coroner’s reports all 
point to continued failures by federal and provincial [[government]]s to take 
concrete action to stem or reverse these crises. This failure, which is nothing 
less than colossal in [[Saskatchewan]], sends the very toxic message to society that
[[Indigenous]] lives have less value. Despite all the symbolism in a post-TRC report
[[Canada]], provinces like [[Saskatchewan]] have made very few substantive changes that 
have addressed any of these issues. All the political meetings, negotiation 
tables, and other so-called partnership initiatives haven’t stopped the 
suffering of the people – instead conditions are getting worse.
 
 
This is the reason that Idle No More was born. Not only did this organic social 
movement grew from [[Indigenous]] grassroots community members – it was inspired by 
federal and provincial [[government]] inaction on these social issues and their 
constant breach of our [[Aboriginal]] and [[treaty]] rights. Omnibus bills to remove 
protections for the many lakes and rivers which make up [[Saskatchewan]], together 
with provincial leases, permits and other authorities for corporations to 
continue to steal from [[Indigenous]] lands helped inspire a [[Saskatchewan]] born, 
nationwide movement to demand action. Idle No More wasn’t the first public show 
of [[protest]] over racial injustice, and it won’t be the last. First Nation family 
members of lost loved ones organized the Justice for Our Stolen Children Camp to
again raise awareness and demand action. Their message was simple - the gross 
injustices committed against First Nations peoples in the name of [[racism]] and 
[[misogyny]], like [[poverty]], [[homeless]]ness, over-[[incarceration]], over-representation of
our [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care and [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women and girls 
– are all getting worse, not better.
 
 
It would appear that [[Saskatchewan]]’s [[Premier]] is wholly detached from the problem.
His focus seems to be on maximizing extraction of resources from First Nation 
lands; ignoring [[Aboriginal]], [[treaty]] and lands rights; and clearing the legal 
playing field for more [[violence]]. In his recent Throne Speech, Moe announced that
he will pass “trespass” legislation to allow more policing in “rural” areas. His
focus is on the [[property]] rights of rural farmers without any mention for the 
safety of rural First Nation communities. We all know what this means. More laws
to protect farmers who may hurt or [[kill]] other First Nations youth. His plan is 
eerily similar in nature to the bills proposed in the [[United]] [[States]] by certain 
states, to protect those ([[white]] people) who run over [[protest]]ers with their cars,
for example. Then add to Moe’s trespassing legislation, the fact that he is 
planning to arm conservation officers with AR-15 type carbine rifles! The very 
same conservation officers, who have recently been authorized to enter reserves 
through an MOU with the Federation of Sovereign [[Indigenous]] Nations (FSIN). 
 
 
There is a political storm brewing in [[Saskatchewan]] that further risks the lives 
of First Nations people. Trespass legislation and semi-automatic weapons are the
not answer. Land and resource transfers back to First Nations, ending 
discriminatory practices, implementing [[treaty]] rights - all of those would 
contribute to justice for First Nations. Pumping more weapons into First Nation 
territory will only lead to more [[death]]s.
 
 
It is long past the time that the province of [[Saskatchewan]] take real steps to 
stem the race-based [[violence]] and [[death]]s of First Nations from whose lands and 
waters every single resident of [[Saskatchewan]] benefits.
