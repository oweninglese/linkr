[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] and a Continent
in Dissolution” The [[America]]n Civil [[War]] in the
Making of [[Canadian]] Confederation

Between [[1864]] and [[1873]] the [[British]] colonies on the northen half of the [[North]]
[[America]]n continent were united into a new and larger [[colony]] that stretched from
the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]] Ocean. One factor that led to the Confederation of the
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies and the creation of the Dominion of [[Canada]] in
[[1867]] was clearly the northern victory in the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], which permanently changed the balance of power on the [[North]] [[America]]n continent. [[Canadian]]
historians have been divided over precisely how important the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]
was among the other factors which led to the Confederation of [[Canada]]. This paper
examines this historiographical debate and the recent [[research]] into the impact of
the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] in order to assess who has the better case.
keywords: [[Canada]]; [[America]]n Civil [[War]]; Confederation; [[Canadian]] historiography; [[America]]n-[[Canadian]] relations

No [[Canadian]] historian would deny that the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] had an
impact on the [[1867]] decision of the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies to form
a federal union. But how important the Civil [[War]] was among the other
economic and political factors that led to Confederation has long been a
subject of controversy, in large part reflecting how [[Canadian]] historians
have viewed the nature of the [[America]]n–[[Canadian]] relationship. The first
serious scholarly studies of that relationship were written between [[1936]]
and [[1945]], as part of a twenty-five-volume series sponsored by the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, on the relations of [[Canada]] and the
[[United]] [[States]]. Not surprisingly, since the emphasis of the series was on
the importance of [[America]]n–[[Canadian]] friendship and the emergence of
an undefended border, the significance of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] as a disruptive element in the evolution of peace along the [[America]]n–[[Canadian]]
border was downplayed.
Not all [[Canadian]] historians were satisfied with the somewhat benign
interpretation of [[America]]n–[[Canadian]] relations embodied in the Carnegie

series, and in the [[1950]]s and [[1960]]s a number of more nationalistic
[[Canadian]] historians began to paint a very different picture of the nature of
that relationship. They argued that there was nothing inevitable about the
evolution of [[America]]n-[[Canadian]] friendship and stressed that the fear of
[[America]]n aggression was one of the most important factors—indeed, perhaps the most important factor—that led to Confederation in [[1867]]. This
interpretation was at the heart of the major books written to commemorate the [[1967]] centennial of [[Canada]]’s founding, and it struck a chord among
those [[Canadian]] nationalists who saw a continuing threat to [[Canada]]’s survival from ever closer integration with the [[United]] [[States]]. During the latter
part of the twentieth century, these fears diminished, and a new generation
of historians began to question many of the assumptions on which the centennial histories had been written, including the assumption that the fear
of [[America]]n expansionism served as the primary factor behind the movement for Confederation. This article not only explores the historiographical debate among historians of [[Canada]] over the role of the [[America]]n Civil
[[War]] but also examines, in the light of recent [[research]], whether it was the
[[Canadian]] centennial historians of the [[1960]]s or their critics who have the
better case.
First, a little background may be in order for readers unfamiliar with
Confederation. In [[1864]], the [[British]] Empire in [[North]] [[America]] consisted of
five colonies stretching from the [[Great]] Lakes to [[New]]foundland, two small
colonies on the [[Pacific]] Coast (which in [[1866]] would be united into one), and
a huge area in between nominally under the control of the Hudson’s [[Bay]]
Company. The idea of creating a union—or Confederation—of the existing colonies in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] had long been a topic of discussion
among the elites throughout [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], but until [[1864]] it had
not been practical politically. All five of the eastern colonies already largely
ran their own internal affairs and were content to leave the [[British]] [[government]] with the responsibility for defense and external relations. The initiative for change came from the [[United]] Province of [[Canada]], by far the largest
of the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies. It had been created by the amalgamation of Upper and Lower [[Canada]] in [[1841]], but the union of the two
[[Canada]]s had never been entirely happy, since Lower [[Canada]] had a substantial [[French]] Catholic majority and Upper [[Canada]] was composed overwhelmingly of [[British]] Protestants. In [[1841]] both sections had been given
equal representation in the Assembly of the [[United]] Province, but the more
rapid growth of Upper [[Canada]] through immigration from the [[British]] Isles
led to a demand for representation by population. Since this would inevitably upset the balance of power in the [[colony]] by reducing the in[[flu]]ence
of the [[French]] [[Canadian]]s, the result was political deadlock. Indeed, the

political crisis in the [[United]] Province of [[Canada]] led to the creation of the
[[Great]] Coalition in [[1864]], formed out of three of the four major parties in the
[[colony]], which was formed on the basis of making Confederation a priority.
For the [[Great]] Coalition to achieve Confederation, it had to persuade the
Maritime colonies and [[New]]foundland of the merits of joining what was
to become a transcontinental union. During three weeks of meetings at
[[Quebec]] City in [[October]] [[1864]], the delegates from the [[United]] Province of
[[Canada]] and the four [[Atlantic]] colonies hammered out seventy-two resolutions designed to form the basis of the constitution for a new federal union,
under which the existing colonies would retain some of their powers but
would also surrender substantial authority to a new central [[government]]
based in [[Ottawa]]. The [[Quebec]] Resolutions formed the basis of the [[British]]
[[North]] [[America]] Act, passed by the [[British]] Parliament in [[1867]], which created the Dominion of [[Canada]] on [[July]] 1, [[1867]]. Initially only the [[United]]
Province of [[Canada]] (divided into the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]])
and two of the Maritime colonies, [[New]] [[Brunswick]] and Nova Scotia,
entered Confederation, but by [[1873]] all of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] except
for [[New]]foundland had become part of the Dominion. The Dominion of
[[Canada]] was not an independent state but remained a [[colony]] of [[Great]]
[[Britain]], which continued to have control over the conduct of [[Canada]]’s
external relations and to accept a commitment for guaranteeing [[Canada]]’s
security. Between [[1864]] and [[1873]], in less than a decade, a new transcontinental nation had been created out of the fragments of the [[British]]
Empire on the northern half of the [[North]] [[America]]n continent, one strong
enough, with [[British]] support, to survive on a continent dominated by the
[[United]] [[States]].
In the first scholarly [[history]] of Confederation, [[Canadian]] Federation: Its
Origin and Achievement: A Study in Nation Building, R. G. Trotter mentions that the [[British]] [[America]]ns in the [[1860]]s were afraid that the [[United]]
[[States]] might “become a menace to the [[British]] provinces and territories
and absorb them one by one, if they remained separate and weak,” but he
deals only briefly with the impact of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], focusing on
“the growth of colonial self-consciousness and pride.”1 A committed internationalist, Trotter believed that [[Canadian]] relations with the [[United]] [[States]]
provided an example of international cooperation and peaceful coexistence, and he strongly supported the most ambitious scholarly project of
the [[1930]]s, the Carnegie Endowment’s series. The intellectual inspiration
for the Carnegie series came from two expatriate [[Canadian]]s teaching at
Columbia University, John Bartlet Brebner and James T. Shotwell.2
Perhaps the volume that best captures the spirit of the series is The
Mingling of the [[Canadian]] and [[America]]n Peoples, begun by Marcus L.

Hansen but completed by Brebner. The book traces the movement of populations back and forth across the border, which is seen as an artificial
and unnatural boundary dividing two peoples who share a common [[history]] and an almost identical culture. Several of the volumes in the series
dealt with the crises along the border from [[1815]] to [[1871]], but one comes
away with the impression that the end result—good relations between the
two countries and an undefended border—was inevitable, given that the
boundary between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]] is “one of the most artificial in the world.”3 In [[1945]], in the concluding volume, Brebner accepted
that the series had not sufficiently acknowledged the role played by [[Great]]
[[Britain]] in shaping the [[history]] of the [[North]] [[America]]n continent. Indeed,
he argued that the Anglo-[[America]]n partition of [[North]] [[America]] “had been
practically determined by [[1821]]. [[Spain]] in the southwest and [[Russia]] in the
northwest had still to be ousted, but the outlines of the future [[United]] [[States]]
and Dominion of [[Canada]] were in the main forecast.” As [[America]] increasingly dominated the continent, [[Canada]]’s salvation lay in the “improved
relations between [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the [[United]] [[States]],” symbolized by
the undefended border created by the Rush-Bagot Agreement of [[1817]]
and by “the Anglo-[[America]]n collaboration which produced the Monroe
Doctrine of [[1823]].” There would be friction after [[1823]], but gradually the
[[United]] [[States]] and the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies would grow closer
together, especially after the Reciprocity [[Treaty]] of [[1854]], even though some
[[Canadian]]s persuaded themselves “that they were more [[British]] than they
actually were.”4
That last comment aroused considerable resentment among those
[[Canadian]]s who, unlike Brebner, continued to see the [[British]] connection—
even an attenuated one—as a defining element in the [[Canadian]] identity.
One [[Canadian]] historian skeptical of the attempt to separate [[Canadian]] [[history]] from its imperial origins was C. P. Stacey. After graduating from the
University of [[Toronto]] and Oxford, Stacey followed a career path similar to
that of many other [[Canadian]] academics in the interwar years, completing
his PhD and then teaching in the [[United]] [[States]], in his case at Princeton.
Years later, in his autobiography he admitted that he went to Princeton
with “many [[mental]] reservations,” since like most [[Canadian]]s of his generation, he “had been nurtured on memories of the [[War]] of [[1812]] and the
Fenian Raids.”5 In [[1936]] in [[Canada]] and the [[British]] Army, [[1846]]–[[1871]], Stacey
insisted that [[British]] soldiers and [[British]] money had “preserved [[Canada]]”
from absorption into the [[United]] [[States]] and that the fear of a [[British]] withdrawal had been one of the key pressures which led to Confederation.6
Brebner invited Stacey to contribute a volume to the Carnegie series, and
Stacey began work on the project but in [[1940]] he became a major in the

[[Canadian]] army. By this time, he had completed a “pretty fair manuscript, if
I do say it myself,” and he submitted it to the Carnegie Endowment, authorizing the [[editorial]] board to publish it “if they saw fit.” To Stacey’s surprise,
they did not see fit. He blamed the decision on Arthur MacFarlane: “an
editor, and I think embittered [[Canadian]], who on the basis of his marks
on the manuscript disliked it intentionally. He, I think, thought it anti[[America]]n.” Stacey was encouraged to resubmit the manuscript after the
war, but by then the Carnegie series had run out of money.7 In [[1950]] Stacey
got his revenge with an article in the [[America]]n Historical Review, entitled
“The Myth of the Unguarded Frontier, [[1815]]–[[1871]].” Stacey declared that the
notion of the “undefended frontier” was “a popular legend,” that the RushBagot Agreement of [[1817]] represented not an “act of faith” in international
peace but “a measure of expediency” and that for the half century after
the agreement, war between [[Britain]] and the [[United]] [[States]] was “possible,
sometimes probable.”8 The creation of the Dominion of [[Canada]], Stacey
insisted in a later article, was a product not of increasingly friendly relations between [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]] but of the “atmosphere of
crisis” that emerged during the [[America]]n Civil [[War]].9
This was also the view of [[Donald]] Creighton, who had contributed a
volume to the Carnegie series, but one at odds with its general theme.
Creighton had emphasized that [[Canada]] existed not in defiance of geography but because of the existence of the St. Lawrence–[[Great]] Lakes system, which, with the support of [[Great]] [[Britain]], enabled [[Canadian]]s to
compete with rival systems to the [[South]] in the commercial penetration
of the interior of the continent. It was this rivalry, Creighton argued, that
led to the creation of two nations in the northern part of [[North]] [[America]].10
In a report produced in [[1938]] for a Royal Commission, Creighton argued
that although the Reciprocity [[Treaty]] of [[1854]] had “inaugurated a new era
of harmony” with the [[United]] [[States]], by [[1864]] “the [[United]] [[States]] appeared
in its old light, a vast and encroaching organization, politically truculent,
economically aggressive.” Confederation, Creighton asserted, “could be
regarded as a foot-note to the [[history]] of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]].”11 In [[1958]]
he argued in “The [[United]] [[States]] and [[Canadian]] Confederation” that the
critical turning point in [[Canadian]]–[[America]]n relations had been the period
from [[1858]] to [[1864]], when “the survival of the existing [[[British]]] colonies
in a continent dominated by the [[United]] [[States]] was still not entirely certain; but far more uncertain was [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]’s acquisition of the
north-west and its expansion to the [[Pacific]].” Creighton accepted that the
initiative for some kind of federal union of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] arose
out of “the chronic weakness and instability” of the politics of the [[United]]
Province of [[Canada]], but he insisted that it was “the steady and ominous

deterioration” of relations between the [[United]] [[States]] and the [[United]]
[[King]]dom that led to a growing consensus in favour of Confederation both
in the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n Colonies and in London.”12 The union of
the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies would not only create a much larger
[[colony]] better able to undertake greater responsibility for its own defense
and with the resources to acquire the vast territories in the West nominally
under the control of the Hudson’s [[Bay]] Company, but it would reinforce
the commitment of the [[British]] [[government]] to defend its [[North]] [[America]]n
colonies against an increasingly aggressive [[America]]n [[government]].
In [[1964]] Creighton would develop these themes in The Road to Confederation: The Emergence of [[Canada]], [[1863]]–[[1867]]. Once again, he placed great
emphasis on the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]’s catalytic role, particularly on the
impact of the Trent Affair in [[1861]], when the decision of an [[America]]n warship to board a [[British]] vessel and seize two Confederate envoys to the [[British]] [[government]] brought the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Britain]] closer to war than
the two nations had been at any point since the [[War]] of [[1812]]. “In those fearful weeks of [[December]], the [[[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n] provinces, in a sudden blaze of illumination, comprehended their real nature and their true
destiny. Roused by the dangers of the Trent crisis, they confirmed their
identification with [[Britain]] and declared their determination to fight for
their collective independence in [[North]] [[America]].” In a phrase W. L. Morton
also used, Creighton argued that [[North]] [[America]] in the [[1860]]s was a “continent in dissolution.” Not only did the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] push [[British]]
[[America]]ns toward the creation of a national [[government]] to defend themselves against an increasingly powerful and aggressive [[United]] [[States]], but
it reinforced their belief in the superiority of the [[British]] system of constitutional monarchy over the [[America]]n system of republican democracy. To
appease the [[French]] [[Canadian]] majority in Lower [[Canada]], the Fathers of
Confederation were forced to emulate the [[America]]n example and create
a federal rather than a legislative union. But partly because they believed
the [[South]]’s secession showed that the [[America]]n constitution had left too
much power in the hands of the states and partly because of the need to
build a transcontinental nation, they gave the new federal [[parliament]] all of
the most important and vital functions of a nineteenth-century state. Confederation, Creighton concluded, “grew out of the will to survive; survival
was threatened by the marked hostility of the [[America]]ns; and dislike and
distrust of the [[United]] [[States]] became a potent force in the growth of the
new [[British]] [[America]]n nationalism.”13
These views were shared by W. L. Morton, with whom Creighton joined
to produce the [[Canadian]] Centenary series, a [[history]] of [[Canada]] published
in nineteen volumes between [[1963]] and [[1986]]. In Morton’s words, the series
﻿b ritis h n orth a m e ric a a n d a con t i n e n t i n di s s o lu t i o n ﻿ 5 1 7

was designed “to re-emphasize the [[British]] connection and the [[Europe]]an
heritage of [[Canada]]” as against the [[North]] [[America]]n environ[[mental]]ism of
the Carnegie series.14 Like Creighton, Morton believed the critical period in
the evolution of the [[Canadian]] nation had been the [[1860]]s, as he made clear
in a [[1962]] article, “[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] and a Continent in Dissolution.”
Although the [[North]] fought the Civil [[War]] “to maintain democracy by maintaining the Union,” Morton believed the war was also fought “to maintain
[[America]]n supremacy in the [[America]]s” and that it had permanently and
irrevocably altered the balance of power on the [[North]] [[America]]n continent, leaving both [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] vulnerable to [[America]]n pressure
and in[[flu]]ence. Morton believed that “all of the elements of [[[British]] [[North]]
[[America]]n] union, all of the impulses which made for it” had been present
earlier, but it took the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] to convince the [[British]] [[government]] and the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies that Confederation was
essential. Again, like Creighton, Morton placed particular importance
on the Trent Crisis, which he described as the “[[Canadian]] Declaration of
Independence” but from the [[United]] [[States]] rather than from [[Britain]].15 In
the volume Morton wrote for the centenary series in [[1964]], The Critical
Years: The Union of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], [[1857]]–[[1873]], he was more sympathetic than Creighton to the ideal of federalism, much more sympathetic
to [[French]] [[Canadian]] nationalism, and much less doctrinaire about the role
anticipated for the provinces within Confederation. Like Creighton, however, he believed that if [[British]] [[America]] was to survive it had “to throw
off the [[America]]nism that had insensibly triumphed since [[1849]] with self[[government]] and to establish a nationality by means of federal union under
a constitutional monarchy.”16
Creighton and Morton were arguably the most important and in[[flu]]ential historians of their generation. Both wrote general histories of [[Canada]]
that went through several editions and were widely used as texts in
[[Canadian]] university courses. Creighton had numerous graduate students
at the University of [[Toronto]], one of whom, Peter B. Waite, contributed
a major study of the press and public opinion in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]
from [[1864]] to [[1867]].17 Creighton also published a two-volume study of Sir
John A. Macdonald, which argued that Macdonald had played the central
role in the creation of Confederation, while one of his colleagues at the
University of [[Toronto]], J. M. S. Careless, contributed a two-volume biography of Macdonald’s Liberal rival, George Brown, whom Careless described
as the true instigator of Confederation.18 All of these authors insisted
on the critical importance of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] in the creation of
[[Canada]], as did Robin Winks, an [[America]]n historian at Yale University. In
[[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]: The Civil [[War]] Years, Winks noted that “the

[[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n provinces felt themselves open to attack from an
[[America]] that many provincials considered to be emotional, untrustworthy,
and grasping.”19
There were important differences of emphasis between the [[Canadian]]
historians. Stacey, Creighton, and Morton were born in the decade before
the First World [[War]] (in [[1906]], [[1902]], and [[1908]]). Stacey and Creighton
grew up in [[Toronto]], a city so [[British]] in its loyalties and Protestant in its
culture that it was often called the Belfast of [[Canada]], while Morton was
born in Gladstone, [[Manitoba]], a town settled mainly by immigrants from
[[Ontario]]. All three studied at Oxford. All had family roots in [[Canadian]]
soil that went back generations, but all three believed in the importance
of [[British]] culture and [[British]] institutions in the shaping of the [[Canadian]]
national identity. Not surprisingly, all three were annoyed to be told by J.
B. Brebner that their parents and grandparents had not been as [[British]] as
they thought they were. [[British]] [[America]]ns, Creighton insisted, “thought of
themselves as [[British]] subjects, whose title was not in the slightest diminished by their distance from the centre of [[empire]].”20 Stacey, Morton, and
Creighton never denied that [[Canada]] was essentially a [[North]] [[America]]n
society, but they insisted that its [[North]] [[America]]n character had been tempered by the [[British]] institutions and traditions that [[Canada]] had adopted
as its own. The inhabitants of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], Morton wrote, might
be [[America]]n, but they were determined to “be [[America]]n in their own way,
[[British]] [[America]]n.” In a sense, all three men belonged to the last generation
of [[British]] [[America]]ns, as the [[British]] connection unraveled in the [[1960]]s and
English [[Canadian]]s began to reinvent their national identity with a new
flag, a new national anthem, and a commitment to biculturalism and then
[[multiculturalism]].21
As the [[British]] connection unraveled in the [[1960]]s, Creighton and
Morton became increasingly anti-[[America]]n in their politics. In their
works on Confederation, they had maintained a degree of objectivity, but
now they despaired of [[Canada]]’s survival as an independent country. In an
oft-quoted remark, Morton lamented “the present condition of [[Canada]], in
which the country is so irradiated by the [[America]]n presence that it sickens
and threatens to dissolve in cancerous slime,” while Creighton published
a survey of [[Canada]]’s First Century in [[1970]] notable for its anti-[[America]]n
tone.22 Not all the historians writing about Confederation in the [[1960]]s
shared these concerns. Careless and Waite were born after the First World
[[War]] (in [[1919]] and [[1922]]) and had come of age in a very different [[Canada]].
They approved of the movement toward a more clearly defined [[Canadian]]
national identity, and their fear of [[Canada]]’s eventual absorption into the
[[United]] [[States]] was more muted (though not entirely absent). Nonetheless,

whatever their differences over the direction [[Canada]] was taking in the
[[1960]]s, Careless and Waite shared with Stacey, Morton, and Creighton the
belief that the [[1860]]s marked a critical turning point in the founding of the
[[Canadian]] nation and that Confederation would not have taken place in that
decade—certainly not in the form that it did—without the fears aroused by
the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]. On this point, there was a clear consensus among
all of the historians writing about Confederation in the [[1960]]s, and it was
this interpretation that would shape the [[history]] of Confederation, at least
in English [[Canada]], for decades.23
One of the assumptions on which the Carnegie series was based was
that the growth of Anglo-[[America]]n friendship was inevitable in the nineteenth century. The [[1960]]s historians of Confederation challenged this:
in their view, the [[United]] [[States]]’ growing power on the [[North]] [[America]]n
continent, particularly after the [[North]]’s victory in the [[America]]n Civil [[War]],
posed a serious threat to the remaining [[British]] colonies on the northern
half of the continent. Most studies of Anglo-[[America]]n relations have come
to the same conclusion. As early as [[1967]], in his study on [[Britain]] and the
Balance of Power in [[North]] [[America]], Kenneth Bourne concentrated “on the
decline of hostility rather than the rise of friendship,” agreeing with Stacey
that only after the Civil [[War]] did “all thoughts” of another Anglo-[[America]]n
war begin to recede, and then only gradually.24 In Unfinished Revolution:
The Early [[America]]n Republic in a [[British]] World, Sam Haynes points out
that well into the nineteenth century [[America]] remained in some respects
“a cultural and economic satellite of the [[British]] Empire.” Many [[America]]ns
resented this dependency, and [[America]]n [[government]]s could therefore
draw “from a deep wellspring of anti-[[British]] sentiment” that tended to
frame [[British]] diplomatic activities in the western hemisphere in conspiratorial terms.25
Although [[Britain]] remained the “dominant power” in the [[Western]] hemisphere until the middle of the nineteenth century, it had no desire for war
with the [[United]] [[States]].26 This was not because the [[British]] ruling class felt
any great sympathy for the [[United]] [[States]] or a sense of kinship with the
[[America]]ns. [[British]] attitudes toward the [[United]] [[States]] remained ambivalent throughout the nineteenth century. Another war was avoided because
[[British]] policy in [[North]] [[America]] was primarily defensive; it sought to hold
on to what it had but it did not seek to expand its territorial possessions.27
During the later [[1840]]s and the [[1850]]s, the antagonism between [[Britain]]
and the [[United]] [[States]] did begin to weaken. Palmerston noted in [[1859]] that
“commercial interests with the [[United]] [[States]] are so strong that it would
require a very extraordinary state of things to bring an actual war.”28 But
the Anglo-[[America]]n relationship remained fragile and quickly broke down

during the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]. The [[British]] [[government]]’s primary concern
was to avoid getting dragged into the war, but the appointment of William
H. Seward as [[America]]n secretary of state reinforced the belief that the
[[North]] was “an irrational and aggressive power eager for a quarrel.”29
In his recent study, Philip E. Myers plays down the threat of war during this period. The only commotion along the frontier, he claims, was
“by desperate Confederates trying to sway the [[British]] against the [[North]].
Their antics backfired and produced triangular cooperation.” In Myers’s
view, “mutual self-interest driven by international finance” characterized
the Anglo-[[America]]n relationship after the Civil [[War]], and in the interests
of Anglo-[[America]]n cooperation the [[British]] [[government]] compelled its
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies to create a new federal union, which was
left “primarily to fend for itself.”30 Yet Myers’s argument sits uneasily with
the abundant evidence that during the Civil [[War]] [[Britain]] and the [[United]]
[[States]] still viewed each other with suspicion and distrust and that war was
a very real possibility, only narrowly averted during the Trent Crisis of [[1861]]
and certainly a possibility after the collapse of the Confederacy. He particularly underestimates the degree of anger [[Britain]]’s recognition of the [[South]]
as a belligerent power aroused in the [[North]]. One popular marching song
among the northern forces in [[1861]], sung to the tune of “Yankee Doodle,”
declared: “Secession first he would put down, / Wholly and forever, / And
afterwards from [[Britain]]’s crown, / He [[Canada]] would sever.”31
Myers also underestimates the continued commitment of the [[British]]
[[government]] to defend the 3.5 million subjects of [[Queen]] Victoria in [[British]]
[[North]] [[America]]. It is true that successive [[British]] [[government]]s wanted to
reduce their military expenditures and that they welcomed Confederation,
which was essentially a [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n initiative, partly because
they assumed that the [[Canadian]]s would now bear a larger share of the
expense of defending themselves. But in [[July]] [[1864]] during a debate in the
cabinet Lord Palmerston declared that the idea of abandoning [[British]]
[[North]] [[America]] might make abstract sense, “but that is not the opinion of
England, and it is not mine.” Palmerston’s position was that if the [[United]]
[[States]] wanted “revenge for the Alabama by attempting the annexation
of [[Britain]]’s [[Canadian]] colonies, they were welcome to try—the [[United]]
[[King]]dom was a far more powerful nation than the Confederate [[States]] had
ever been.”32
After the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], the [[British]] [[government]] began to refortify [[Quebec]], and, although it withdrew its garrison at [[Quebec]] in [[1871]], it
specifically declared that this decision was “in no way intended to alter or
diminish the obligations which exist on both sides in case of foreign war.”
[[Britain]] retained a naval base in [[Halifax]] and later established one in [[British]]

Columbia. When [[Canada]] had to send a force to the Red River in [[1869]] to
suppress a [[rebellion]] in [[Manitoba]], the force was composed of both [[British]]
regulars and [[Canadian]] militia, to show “that England and [[Canada]] are acting in complete accord and unity in the retention of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]
under [[British]] [[sovereignty]].” Indeed, after the cancellation of the Reciprocity
[[Treaty]] in [[1866]], [[Canada]] was sufficiently confident of [[British]] support to begin
arresting [[America]]n fishing vessels trespassing in [[Canadian]] inshore waters.
Much of the recent literature on Confederation focuses rather narrowly on
the inability of the [[British]] forces stationed in [[Canada]] and of the [[Canadian]]
militia after Confederation to defend the country in the event of another
Anglo-[[America]]n [[War]]. These forces, particularly the militia, might have
been useful in protecting against filibustering activities, but no one really
doubted that in the event of war they could only delay an [[America]]n victory
on land. Ultimately, the defense of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] depended, as it
always had, on the ability of the royal navy to act as a deterrent to [[America]]n
aggression. Given the value of [[trade]] with the [[United]] [[States]] and growing
political instability in [[Europe]], it made sense for the [[British]] to reach an
accommodation with the [[United]] [[States]], through negotiations that led to
the [[Treaty]] of [[Washington]] in [[1871]]. But the mutual antagonism between the
two countries did not dissipate overnight. Indeed, as Stacey noted, it is
doubtful whether any of the principal actors in [[1871]] truly appreciated how
important a landmark the [[Treaty]] of [[Washington]] would become.33
[[British]] [[America]]ns were not wrong in the [[1860]]s in fearing that the
[[America]]n [[government]] had designs on what was left of the [[British]] Empire
in [[North]] [[America]], even if they hoped to achieve their goal by nonviolent
means such as the cancellation of the [[1854]] Reciprocity [[Treaty]]. Nor were
the historians of Confederation in the [[1960]]s wrong in believing that this
fear was one of the major catalysts leading to Confederation. Indeed,
those fears grew steadily, as it gradually became apparent that the [[South]]
was going to lose. Probably the [[America]]n newspaper most quoted in the
[[Canadian]] press was the vehemently anti-[[British]] [[New]] York Herald and the
most quoted [[British]] newspaper the vehemently anti-northern Times of
London. From both sources, [[British]] [[America]]ns absorbed the dangers of a
northern victory.
[[British]] [[America]]n attitudes toward the northern victory were deeply
ambivalent. Very few [[British]] [[America]]ns supported the institution of [[slavery]], but the [[America]]n [[government]]’s failure to abolish [[slavery]] during the
first two years of the war and the fear of an Anglo-[[America]]n war aroused
by the Trent Affair led to growing antagonism toward the [[North]]. W. L.
Morton placed the blame for the development of anti-northern sentiment directly on “the anti-[[British]] tone of much of the northern press and

its brusque assumption that [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] would be easily [[conquer]]ed,” pointing out that [[British]] [[America]] had “no other reason for being
anti-[[North]]ern. It was anti-[[slavery]]; it was ‘[[North]]ern’ to a degree in its social
instincts and its political behaviour . . . and whatever the sophisticated
said, it did not welcome the rise of an independent [[South]] that would keep
the [[North]] in check.”34
Much of the recent literature on [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n attitudes during the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] does build on Robin Winks’s study and sees
a growing sympathy for the [[South]] during the [[America]]n Civil [[War]].35 The
problem is that much of the evidence for this sympathy is drawn from elite
public opinion in the larger cities, whereas most Maritimers and most
[[Canadian]]s did not live in cities. Even the urban elites were divided over
the issue of a southern victory. The [[Toronto]] Globe, the paper with the largest circulation in Upper [[Canada]], was consistently pro-northern. So too
was the whole of the English-language press in the [[Eastern]] Townships of
[[Quebec]].36 In [[Britain]] there was considerably more support for the [[North]]
than for the [[South]] among dissenting congregations and among Chartists,
and the same was probably true in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]].37 James Young,
an Upper [[Canadian]] journalist and later an important Liberal politician,
believed that “though a noisy jingo section in our towns and cities” favored
the [[South]], they did not represent the feelings of the “farmers, merchants,
artisans and masses of the [[Canadian]] people.”38 Yet even those [[British]]
[[America]]ns who continued to support the [[North]] were frightened by the
prospects of what a northern victory would mean for the [[British]] [[North]]
[[America]]n colonies. Those fears were expressed over and over in newspapers across [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], at the Charlottetown and [[Quebec]]
Conferences in [[September]] and [[October]] [[1864]], and in the debates that followed over the [[Quebec]] Resolutions in the various [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n
legislatures throughout [[1864]] and [[1865]]. Indeed, the last stages of the [[War]]
saw a series of incidents—including the St. Albans Raid—that raised tensions along the [[America]]n-[[Canadian]] border.
In the aftermath of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], anti-[[British]] sentiment
in the [[United]] [[States]] remained high. The most “explosive issue” was the
Alabama claims.39 The Alabama was one of a number of commerce raiders
built for the Confederacy in [[British]] shipyards, and after the Civil [[War]] the
[[America]]n [[government]] sought compensation for the damages caused by
the raiders. The first attempt at a compromise over the issue was rejected
in the U.S. Senate by 54 to 1, there was an upsurge in annexationist sentiment, and some [[America]]ns recommended dropping the Alabama claims
in return for [[Canada]]. In retrospect, the idea that [[Britain]] would agree to
hand over her colonies was an illusion, fueled by the mistaken belief that

the [[British]] had lost interest in their [[North]] [[America]]n possessions and by
the even more mistaken belief that many [[Canadian]]s were eager to cut their
ties with the [[British]] Empire.40
The latter assumption was an illusion widely held in the northern states,
as James Young found, to his horror, when, along with [[representative]]s
from all of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies, he attended “the largest commercial convention” ever to take place on [[North]] [[America]]n soil, in Detroit
on [[July]] 11, [[1865]]. Many of those present, like Young, had strongly supported
the [[North]], including Joseph Howe of Nova Scotia, who pointed out that
many young [[Canadian]]s “had shed their blood” for the northern cause and
noted that his own son had served under General Sheridan. Howe’s words
were met with “tumultuous applause,” but shortly afterward J. W. Potter,
the U.S. consul general for [[British]] [[North]] [[America]], rose to declare that
[[Canadian]]s favored annexation and that they would ask for admission to
the Union within two years after the end of the Reciprocity [[Treaty]]. Potter’s
speech was followed by “[[America]]n cheers and [[Canadian]] expressions of dissent.” Like many [[Canadian]]s, Young was a strong supporter of reciprocity,
even though he believed the [[America]]ns had benefitted more from the [[1854]]
[[Treaty]] than [[Canadian]]s, and he was horrified to see “Reciprocity Sacrificed
on the Annexation Alter.” Years later, in [[1902]], Young called the cancellation “a blessing in disguise,” for it “failed to produce the slightest annexation sentiment” and, in fact, helped promote Confederation.41
In the aftermath of the Civil [[War]], [[Canadian]]s continued to fear that the
[[America]]ns had designs on the vast but sparsely settled [[North]]west territories. It was never very likely in the later [[1860]]s that the [[America]]n [[government]] would precipitate a war with [[Britain]] to acquire those territories,
but individual [[America]]ns had engaged in filibustering in the past (most
notably along the [[Canadian]] border in the late [[1830]]s and [[1840]]s), and there
was considerable support in Minnesota for such activities in the West.42
Indeed, the Fenian Raids, which the [[America]]n [[government]] was slow to
suppress, showed there was no guarantee that filibustering raids could
not occur again. It is debatable how much impact the Fenian Raids had
upon the movement toward Confederation (even in [[New]] [[Brunswick]]), but,
as Stacey argued, they certainly helped to strengthen a sense of [[British]]
[[America]]n (soon to be described as [[Canadian]]) nationalism. The chorus
of one of the Anti-Fenian songs of the period proclaimed: “Shout, shout,
shout, ye Loyal Britons! / Cheer up, let the rabble come; / For beneath
the Union Jack / We will drive the Fenians back, / And we’ll fight for our
beloved [[Canadian]] homes.”43
Even in the [[Eastern]] Townships—perhaps the area in [[British]] [[North]]
[[America]] that most fits the classic definition of a borderland in this
524 jou rnal of t h e c iv i l wa r e ra , volum e 7 , i s s u e 4

period—attitudes and loyalties were hardening along the border. The
[[Eastern]] Townships had been settled in the [[1790]]s by post-Loyalists from
[[New]] Hampshire and Vermont in search of cheap land, and the cultural
and economic ties between the populations on both sides of the border
remained remarkably close. The editors of the newspapers in the [[Eastern]]
Townships had supported the [[North]] out of a sense of “kinship,” but they felt
betrayed by the cancellation of reciprocity, the Fenian raids, and the language of “manifest destiny” used by many [[America]]ns. The boundary line
became “more tangible for those people living on either side of it.”44 Even
after the Civil [[War]] was over, its legacy continued to play a part in the evolution of the [[Canadian]] sense of national identity, just as the Confederation
scholars of the [[1960]]s claimed.
The most significant challenge to those scholars has come from a [[British]]
imperial historian. Ged Martin’s stimulating and provocative book [[Britain]]
and the Origins of [[Canadian]] Confederation contains only a handful of
passing references to the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]. Indeed, Martin attempts to
show that the arguments in favor of Confederation advanced by the supporters of Confederation at the time and taken at face value by the historians of the [[1960]]s do not stand up to critical scrutiny. Dis[[missing]] the belief
that Confederation was the answer to continental defense as “implausible”
and the desire to create a transcontinental nation as unimportant because
“westward expansion was not envisaged as a major immediate task for
the [[New]] Dominion,” he concludes that “Confederation was not the most
obvious answer to the continental challenges of [[1864]]. Indeed, if the overwhelming priorities were the need to secure a larger market, better communications and to put an end to the threat of [[America]]n invasion, the
obvious solution—certainly by [[1865]]—would have been to seek annexation
to the [[United]] [[States]]. Even if the provinces had preferred union among
themselves, the logic of overwhelming [[America]]n economic and military
power pointed to Confederation on [[United]] [[States]] terms, under [[United]]
[[States]] protection.”45
But is it not somewhat bizarre to argue that the logical solution to the
continental challenges of the [[1860]]s was the one that [[British]] [[America]]ns
were determined to avoid above all? If one accepts that the primary
concern of most [[British]] [[America]]ns was to ensure [[Canada]]’s survival as a
[[British]] [[colony]] in the face of the threat of [[America]]n expansionism—what
Macdonald described in [[1865]] as “a unanimous feeling of willingness to run
all the hazards of war, if war must come, rather than lose the connection
between the Mother Country and these colonies”—then the commitment
to relieve [[Britain]] of some of the costs of colonial defense and to expand
West as soon as possible make the arguments for Confederation look both

plausible and necessary as a solution to the changing balance of power on
the [[North]] [[America]]n continent.46
Martin is particularly critical of the appeal to “nationality” made by the
Fathers of Confederation, dis[[missing]] it as “a useful rhetorical device in
presenting what might otherwise seem a ramshackle marriage of unequal
stranger provinces as part of the spirit of the age.”47 He is not alone in
his cynicism. Most [[Canadian]] historians have come to see nationalism as
a regressive and undesirable phenomenon that leads to xenophobia and
[[racism]]. They are not much interested in studying the formation and evolution of the [[Canadian]] nation-state, preferring to focus on [[Canadian]]s’
more limited identities or their transnational and borderland connections.
There is a now a huge and growing literature dealing with the impact of
the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] on the evolution of [[America]]n nationalism. Yet it
is a literature that has been almost totally ignored by [[Canadian]] historians.
Obviously, it is important to study the [[Canadian]] nation or any other nation
in a global context, but, as a growing number of scholars have argued,
we need to recognize, whether one likes nationalism or not, “that nations
have played a critical role in [[history]] and are essential in understanding the
past.”48 We also need to understand why nationalism has been so appealing
to so many people over such long periods of time.49
[[Canadian]] Confederation was not a typical [[experiment]] in nation-building. Most of the new nations that emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were created by people who sought to secede from some
larger [[empire]]. Clearly, this was not the case with [[Canada]]. The desire of the
Fathers of Confederation was to strengthen, not weaken, the ties to the
mother country. Partly this reflected the insecurity [[British]] [[America]]ns felt
in the aftermath of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]. If they were to be successful
in their ambition to compete with the [[America]]ns and create an [[empire]] of
their own, one that stretched from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]], they knew
they would need [[British]] support.50 But even after they had succeeded in
their immediate objectives and created a dominion that stretched from sea
to sea and they no longer had any real fear of [[America]]n annexationism,
indeed, even after [[Canada]] had become effectively independent in [[1931]],
English [[Canadian]]s remained proud of being a part of the [[British]] Empire
and were eager to hold on to their status as [[British]] subjects.51
Various factors explain this enthusiasm, but the most important is
demographic. One of the myths propagated by the Carnegie series is the
myth of the intermingling of the [[Canadian]] and [[America]]n peoples. If you
look at the whole period since the [[America]]n Revolution, then there has
indeed been a considerable flow of migration both ways across the border.
But in any given period, the flow of migrants tended to be one way, usually

from [[Canada]] to the [[United]] [[States]]. In fact, after [[1815]] the flow of emigration
for the rest of the nineteenth century was overwhelmingly from [[British]]
[[North]] [[America]] / [[Canada]] to the [[United]] [[States]]. In [[1860]], around half a million [[British]] [[America]]ns lived in the [[United]] [[States]] and the number would
continue to grow during the [[1860]]s. Between thirty-five and fifty thousand
[[British]] [[America]]ns fought in the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], mainly in the northern forces. Some were motivated by pure idealism, particularly by anti[[slavery]] sentiment. Some were young men seeking adventure. Some were
essentially mercenaries, although in many cases those who accepted the
bounties paid to volunteers or the payments given to substitutes may have
been motivated by loftier considerations but did not see why they should
not take advantage of the money on offer. A few were tricked or forced into
volunteering. About twenty-five hundred fighting for the Union were black
residents of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]].52 But the majority (perhaps as many as
70 percent) were men who had emigrated to the [[United]] [[States]] before the
war, most of whom had already become [[America]]n citizens and had voted
in an [[America]]n election. Many of them signed up in the early years of the
war for the same reasons as their [[America]]n neighbors and friends—to
show their commitment to their adopted community, state, and nation.53
“[[British]] [[America]]n” might have accurately described where they were born
but not necessarily their national allegiance or identification.
For most of those [[British]] [[America]]ns who served in the Union forces,
whatever their reasons for enlisting, the war accelerated the transformation of their national identity. One can see the change even during the
war as the language in letters from [[British]] [[America]]ns who had crossed
the border to enlist gradually began to change: letters written with the
pronoun “I” gradually changed to “We,” the [[United]] [[States]] became “my
country,” the [[government]] of the [[United]] [[States]] “our [[government]],” and the
Confederates were described as “rebels.” There was also growing tension
between those [[British]] [[America]]ns who volunteered to fight for the [[North]]
and those at home who became increasingly pro-southern in their sympathies. Norman Wade, who had enlisted in the [[America]]n navy, wrote to his
brother back in Nova Scotia: “I am not surprised to hear your sympathies
for the [[South]]. . . . You say that if three million of people want their freedom,
they ought to have it, but is it freedom they are fighting for, or are they the
dupes of designing politicians? All know that there can be no freer form
of Government than the [[United]] [[States]], and it is no wonder that [[Europe]], a
tyrant, should look upon her with an evil eye.”54
After the war, most [[British]] [[America]]n veterans remained in the [[United]]
[[States]]. There were only a handful of Civil [[War]] veterans’ organizations in
[[Canada]], the largest in Hamilton, [[Ontario]], which numbered more than a

hundred at its peak. And there is only one community in [[Canada]] where
a memorial was erected to a Civil [[War]] veteran—in Kincardine, [[Ontario]],
to Dr. Solomon Secord, a surgeon with the 20th Georgia Volunteers. In
the late nineteenth century, the story of the [[Canadian]]s who fought in the
[[America]]n Civil [[War]] was lost (until Winks and other more popular writers
resurrected it), but that is because the future of those who fought in the
Civil [[War]] lay in their country of adoption, not in the country they had abandoned. In [[Canada]], it was the militia who fought the Fenians who would
be honored and remembered, not those who had fought in a foreign war.
The Civil [[War]] veterans were only exceptional in the speed with which they
were integrated into [[America]]n society. Most English-speaking Protestant
[[British]] [[America]]ns / [[Canadian]]s who migrated to the [[United]] [[States]] in the
nineteenth century quickly became invisible immigrants.55 They did not
intermingle with the [[America]]ns; they became [[America]]ns.
From the [[1840]]s to the [[1860]]s, migration to the [[United]] [[States]] came from
a wide variety of sources, but migration to [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] came
overwhelmingly from one source, the [[United]] [[King]]dom. The exception is
the growth of the black population in Upper [[Canada]] in the late [[1840]]s and
[[1850]]s; some were refugee [[slaves]], but a substantial majority were free men
and women. At its peak in the early [[1860]]s the black population in [[British]]
[[North]] [[America]] may have been as high as thirty to forty thousand with the
largest number—about twenty-three thousand—living in [[Canada]] West.
But after the Civil [[War]] ended there was a substantial exodus to the [[United]]
[[States]]; the [[1871]] census lists 13,435 blacks in [[Canada]] West.56 The only substantial number of [[Europe]]an settlers in the Dominion of [[Canada]] in [[1871]]
were Germans, most of them settled in and around Berlin (later renamed
Kitchener), [[Ontario]], and many of them had roots in [[North]] [[America]] that
stretched back to the eighteenth century. Even including the blacks and
the Germans, the total number of people in [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] in [[1867]]
who traced their origins (even distant ones) to countries other than the
[[United]] [[King]]dom or [[France]] was around 8 percent, and for many of them
ties with their countries of origin were weak.
Particularly strong in the [[1860]]s were the ties of the [[British]] majority
with their ancestral homeland. Wave after wave of [[British]] migrants had
arrived from the [[1820]]s to the [[1860]]s, becoming the dominant group in all
of the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies, except in Lower [[Canada]], where
the [[French]] [[Canadian]]s retained their majority status.57 Whether they had
been born in the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies, migrated from the
[[United]] [[King]]dom, or migrated from somewhere else and been naturalized, all the permanent inhabitants of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] in the [[1860]]s
were [[British]] subjects. When they identified themselves as [[Canadian]]s or

Nova Scotians or Prince Edward Islanders or talked about the [[colony]] in
which they lived as “our country,” the English-speaking population was
using shorthand for “we are [[British]] subjects living in the [[United]] Province
of [[Canada]] or Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island”; they were not indicating a sense of national identity. Only the [[French]] [[Canadian]]s, who formed
(along with the much smaller community of Acadians in the Maritimes)
about a third of the population in [[1867]], had a clear sense of being part of a
distinct “nation.” The notion of forming part of a distinctive culture within
the [[British]] Empire was growing among the English-speaking population,
and the term “[[British]] [[America]]n,” which implied a broader, though still
embryonic, national identity, was becoming increasingly popular.
Nonetheless, the vast majority of the English-speaking inhabitants of
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] in the [[1860]]s would have defined themselves as
“[[British]],” indeed as racial language crept into use in the nineteenth century as members of the “[[British]] race.” Of course, all racial definitions are
by their very nature confused and arbitrary since they lack any scientific
basis. Most mid-nineteenth-century [[British]] [[America]]ns tended to conflate
race and ethnicity (itself a slippery term) and to use “race,” “nation,” and
“people” as if the terms were synonymous. And those who used “[[British]]”
or “[[British]] race” or, frequently, “English” and “English race” [[flu]]ctuated
between a circumscribed ethnic definition that focused on ancestry in the
[[United]] [[King]]dom (and that sometimes included and sometimes excluded
the [[Irish]]) and a broader civic nationalist definition that could be extended
to include those of non-[[British]] ancestry who had adopted “[[British]]” values.58
Whether they had an essentially ethnic or a softer civic definition of their
identity, the English-speaking majority in [[1867]] thought of the Dominion
of [[Canada]] as essentially a [[British]] nation with one large cultural minority—
the [[French]] [[Canadian]]s—that had been guaranteed specific linguistic and
religious rights in the federal [[parliament]] and courts and in the province of
[[Quebec]], where that minority formed a majority.59 Over time, the Englishspeaking population would begin to think of itself more clearly as part of
a distinct “national” group—[[Canadian]]s—within the [[British]] Empire, but as
George Wrong declared in [[1921]]: “It never occurred to the average [[Canadian]]
[by whom he meant English [[Canadian]]], even when his country reached
national status, that he could not remain both a [[Canadian]] and a Briton.”60
In one of his many articles, W. L. Morton wrote that “the great political
decision of [[Canadian]] politics in the Victorian Age was not to confederate
but to be [[British]] rather than [[America]]n. The decision was made at bottom in the crushing of the [[rebellion]]s of [[1837]], and in the Colonial Office’s
resolution to give [[Canada]], as Simcoe had not, a ‘very image and transcript’
of the [[British]] constitution, the most efficient, modern and prestigious of

the day.”61 In the [[1840]]s and [[1850]]s, not all [[British]] [[America]]ns viewed their
colonial constitutions as quite as perfect as Morton implies. Some reformers sought to give the people more control over the colonial assemblies
by pushing for the secret ballot (which was adopted in [[New]] [[Brunswick]]
in [[1855]]), an expanded electorate and elected upper houses. Even some
colonial conservatives supported the introduction of universal male suffrage in Nova Scotia in [[1854]] and an elected legislative council in the [[United]]
Province of [[Canada]] in [[1856]]. Prince Edward Island, with a small electorate composed overwhelmingly of small-scale farmers and tenants, was the
most radical of the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]n colonies, adopting universal
male suffrage in [[1853]] and an elected legislative council in [[1862]]. The [[British]]
[[North]] [[America]]n colonies were thus more willing to consider radical political changes that were associated with the republican system of [[government]] in the [[United]] [[States]] than is usually presumed.62
During the [[America]]n Civil [[War]], the enthusiasm for such reforms began
to decline. Nova Scotia abolished universal male suffrage and restored a
[[property]] qualification in [[1863]], and one of the last acts of the Assembly of
the [[United]] Province of [[Canada]] was to introduce higher [[property]] qualifications for voting (which automatically became the qualifications that applied in the elections to the new House of Commons in [[Ottawa]]). Moreover,
the Fathers of Confederation decided at the [[Quebec]] Conference that the
members of the second chamber in the new federal [[parliament]]—the
Senate—would be appointed, not elected. These decisions reflected a growing consensus within [[Britain]] and her colonies that an excess of democracy
was responsible both for the rise of Napoleon III in [[France]] and the Civil
[[War]] in [[America]]. This attitude reaffirmed a belief in the superiority of the
[[British]] system of [[government]] in protecting personal [[liberty]], individual
rights and the rule of law.63 “In all countries the rights of the majority take
care of themselves,” Macdonald proclaimed during the Confederation
Debates in the [[United]] Province of [[Canada]], “but it is only in countries like
England, enjoying constitutional [[liberty]], and safe from the tyranny of a
single despot or of an unbridled democracy, that the rights of minorities
are regarded.”64
By [[1864]], only Prince Edward Island retained universal male suffrage
and had an elected legislative council, and one of the arguments the antiConfederates on the Island used against the proposed union with the mainland colonies was that “we would be at the mercy of those who do not think
as we do on the issue of [[parliament]]ary representation. We have universal
manhood suffrage and an elective legislative council; but they have neither.”65 The Fathers of Confederation were not democrats. They believed
not in the [[sovereignty]] of the people but in the [[sovereignty]] of a [[parliament]]

that represented the diverse interests in the state, checked by an upper
house that, if not hereditary, was appointed with a higher [[property]] qualification than applied for members elected to the House of Commons, and
checked by a monarch who represented the nation, not merely the party
in power. Yet while they sought to protect individual [[liberty]] and enshrine
the rule of law, they also believed in the need for a strong executive [[government]]. In their view, the system of [[parliament]]ary [[government]] (or responsible [[government]], as they called it) was the best way of achieving this goal
through the fusion of the executive and the legislative branches of [[government]] rather than through the division of powers that lay at the heart of the
[[America]]n system.
The [[1960]]s historians of Confederation believed that the Fathers of
Confederation drew another lesson from the [[America]]n Civil [[War]]—the
dangers of a decentralized federal union. They argued that the delegates
at the [[Quebec]] Conference accepted the need for a federal union, partly
because the [[French]] [[Canadian]]s would never have agreed to join a legislative
union based upon the principle of representation on the basis of population and partly because many Maritimers wished to retain their provincial assemblies. Nonetheless, in various ways the Fathers of Confederation
sought to ensure the predominance of the new federal authority. In his
recent introduction to The Road to Confederation, [[Donald]] Wright contends that a new academic consensus has emerged in [[Canada]] which
maintains that the Fathers of Confederation “did not intend to create a
centralized federation.”66 But this new academic consensus rests on some
very shaky historical foundations. The historians and political scientists
writing about Confederation in the [[1980]]s and [[1990]]s were desperately trying to convince the people of [[Quebec]] that separatism was unnecessary
because the highly centralized federal system that had evolved in [[Canada]]
since [[1939]] could be altered to accommodate [[Quebec]]’s needs. They were
just as motivated by political objectives as—indeed, perhaps more motivated than—the [[1960]]s historians whom they criticized. This is particularly
true of Paul Romney, who attempts to show in Getting It Wrong: How
[[Canadian]]s Forgot Their Past and Imperilled Confederation that the great
failure of English-[[Canadian]] historians has been to treat Confederation “as
essentially an exercise in nation-building rather than a plan designed to
gratify the yearnings of [[French]] [[Canadian]]s and Upper [[Canadian]]s alike to
be masters in their own house.” The problem with Romney’s argument is
that he has to explain away both what the Fathers of Confederation said
and what they agreed to at the [[Quebec]] Conference. In neither endeavor is
he really successful, particularly in confronting the decisions enshrined in
the [[Quebec]] Resolutions and ultimately in the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act.67

Not only was the list of powers given to the national [[government]] in
[[1867]] extensive, but also the Fathers of Confederation were determined to
avoid what they saw as the major flaw in the [[America]]n federal system—
the decision to give the residual power to the states—by giving that power
to the federal [[government]]. The federal [[government]] was also given control over indirect taxation, the major source of [[government]] revenue in
the nineteenth century, the power to appoint the lieutenant-governors of
the provinces and the members of the Senate, and even the power to veto
provincial legislation with which for any reason it disagreed. In [[Canada]],
unlike the [[United]] [[States]], provincial judges would be appointed by the federal [[government]], criminal law would be the same across the country, and
only the federal [[government]] would have the power to enact militia laws
and call out troops to maintain order in an emergency. Romney admits
that it is “easy to understand why [[French]]-speaking critics in particular
condemned the [[Quebec]] scheme as a legislative union in all but name,” but
insists that the Upper [[Canadian]] Reformers at the [[Quebec]] Conference were
more far-sighted than the other Fathers of Confederation. They agreed to
give the new federal [[government]] the power to veto provincial legislation
because it would make “no difference”; it was bound to wither away just
like the imperial power of disallowance. They knew that in time “[[property]] and civil rights” would become the residual clause in the constitution,
leading to an expansion of provincial authority. Indeed, the goal at [[Quebec]]
was to create a constitution that combined “local autonomy with the minimum of political cohesion required to dissuade the member provinces
from thinking that they had joined a club that they could leave whenever
they liked.”68
Even if George Brown and Oliver Mowat did believe this—and Romney
presents no convincing evidence that they did—the other Fathers of
Confederation clearly did not. The power of disallowance would be used
repeatedly after Confederation until [[1942]], and the lieutenant governors
effectively remained federal agents until the Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council ([[Canada]]’s final court of appeal until [[1949]]) altered their status. Brown and Mowat must have been very farsighted indeed to know
that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would eventually support a provincial rights interpretation of the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act,
after the appointment of Lord Watson in [[1888]]. In the end, Watson and
his successor, Lord Haldane, probably did produce a more “workable” federal constitution—one more in line with the desires of most [[Canadian]]s
in the late nineteenth century after the framework for a transcontinental nation had been established and the fears of [[America]]n aggression had
receded. But, as John Saywell argues, Lord Watson manipulated the text

of the [[British]] [[North]] [[America]] Act and attempted to rewrite its [[history]],
while “Lord Haldane’s law was a sometimes bizarre amalgam of historical revisionism, Watsonian structuralism, twisted doctrine, and deliberate policy considerations.”69 The irony is that it was Macdonald, who had
strongly insisted that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should
be the ultimate arbiter in federal-provincial disputes—partly to strengthen
[[Canada]]’s imperial ties and partly (one presumes) because he believed the
Judicial Committee would share his centralist vision.70 As it turned out,
this was a mistaken assumption, but not one that anyone could have predicted in [[1864]].
Creighton undoubtedly overstated the centralist case when he declared
that the provinces had been designed in [[1864]] to function “in much the
same way as municipalities,” retaining only “some dim family resemblance to the vanished ‘provincial’ [[government]]s of the past.”71 Morton
and Waite both admitted that there was some ambiguity in the [[Quebec]]
Resolutions and a degree of tension between those favoring centralization
and those who wanted a looser federal union. But even they agreed that
the clear intention of the Fathers of Confederation was to avoid what they
saw as the defects of the [[America]]n federal system and to create a strong
national [[government]].72 Of course, there was a tradition of localism in
Upper [[Canada]], but as Elwood Jones points out, the timing and achievement of Confederation rested “more upon external pressures than upon
localism” and the most significant of those pressures was the [[America]]n
Civil [[War]].73
The Civil [[War]] did not create the desire for Confederation, certainly not
in Upper [[Canada]], the area with the highest proportion of [[British]] immigrants and their [[child]]ren and the area likely to benefit the most from the
consolidation of [[Canada]]’s position in the West. Even at the [[Great]] Reform
Convention of [[1859]], the idea of a Confederation of the [[British]] [[North]]
[[America]] colonies had widespread support among the delegates. “While
other nations are seeking unity; while the [[Italian]]s are fighting for it, and
the Germans sighing for it—why should we not seek the formation of a
national feeling in this part of [[British]] [[America]], which must eventually
take its place among the nations of the earth?” So asked George Wilkes,
who favored Confederation as a first step toward the creation of a nation
stretching “from the eastern to the western sea.” David Christie, a leading Clear Grit, declared that every “true patriot” must believe that one day
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] will be “a separate nation” and in his closing address
to the convention Brown declared, “I do hope there is not one [[Canadian]] in
this Assembly who does not look forward to the day when these northern countries shall stand out among the nations of the world as one great

confederation.”74 Brown made the same point in the [[Toronto]] Globe in [[1863]]:
“The Union of all [[British]] [[America]] is not a question of gain with us; it is
one of political prestige and nationality.” The time might not be right at
the moment, but “we look forward to it as our destiny.”75 What was needed
was some external pressure that could turn the idea of Confederation into
practical politics. It was not the political crisis in the [[United]] Province of
[[Canada]], for that could have been resolved by a federal union of the two
[[Canada]]s. It was, as the historians of the [[1960]]s suggested, the crisis caused
by the [[America]]n Civil [[War]].
The [[America]]n Civil [[War]], Thomas D’Arcy McGee declared in [[1864]], is “a
true continental crisis; it is a [[Canadian]] crisis as well as a Republican crisis,
and we can no more escape from its consequences than we can throw up
a [[Chinese]] wall of exclusion instead of the existing boundary lines.”76 In
an [[1864]] speech, Brown stressed that “the present situation of the great
nation alongside of us” had persuaded him to join with his political enemies in a coalition dedicated to bringing about Confederation.77 Indeed,
only a crisis of the magnitude of the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] could have compelled [[British]] [[America]]n politicians to make the compromises and take the
political risks necessary to reach an agreement at the [[Quebec]] Conference
in [[1864]]. Brown, a devout Protestant who had a well-earned reputation
for being anti–[[French]] [[Canadian]], had to surrender some of his principles
and work with George Etienne Cartier, the leader of the [[French]] [[Canadian]]
majority in [[Quebec]], who stood for everything Brown despised. Cartier had
to be prepared to make concessions on the issue of provincial autonomy
for which he would be criticized by more radical [[French]] [[Canadian]] nationalists.78 There was no more unlikely [[alliance]] than that between Thomas
D’Arcy McGee, one of the political spokesmen for the [[Irish]] Catholic minority in Lower [[Canada]], and Ogle Gowan, one of the leading Orangemen in
Upper [[Canada]], but they were able to overcome their differences and find
“common ground” in the goal of constructing, in McGee’s words, “a strong
and autonomous [[Canada]] within the [[British]] [[empire]], counterbalancing the
democratic tendencies of the [[New]] World.”79
The Maritime pro-Confederates also had to make substantial concessions and take great political risks. The terms offered to the Maritime
colonies by the [[Quebec]] Resolutions were not particularly generous. An
upper house appointed on the basis of sectional, not provincial, equality,
and consisting of members appointed for life by the federal [[government]]
was not likely to be very effective at protecting Maritime interests against
the [[Canadian]] majority in a House of Commons elected on the basis of
proportional representation, certainly not as effectively as the [[America]]n
Senate, a model that the Fathers of Confederation rejected at the [[Quebec]]

Conference. And however much autonomy the provinces were to be given,
the financial arrangements agreed on at [[Quebec]] were bound to leave the
Maritime provincial [[government]]s dependent on handouts from the federal [[government]]. What is surprising is not that there was opposition to
these terms but that there was so much support for them.80
But the reason the Maritime delegates at [[Quebec]] had agreed to these
terms and the reason why so many Maritimers were willing to accept them
was that they too were convinced that the [[America]]n Civil [[War]] had changed
the balance of power on the [[North]] [[America]]n continent. The [[1960]]s historians of Confederation did not get everything right. They downplayed the
darker side of the dream of a transcontinental nation, ignoring the impact
[[Canadian]] imperial expansion would have on the [[indigenous]] peoples of
the West. But they were surely correct in arguing that in the [[1860]]s [[North]]
[[America]] was a continent in dissolution and that the [[America]]n Civil war
played a critical role in pushing [[British]] [[America]]ns towards the creation of
a new transcontinental nation.

55. The experience of [[French]] [[Canadian]]s seems to have been different, since language and religion set them apart from the [[America]]n mainstream. They would be
gradually acculturated, but their sense of ethnic identity remained strong, and they
would define themselves as Franco-[[America]]ns, whereas English-speaking [[Canadian]]s
quickly became just [[America]]ns. Something over ten thousand [[French]] [[Canadian]]s,
mostly resident in the [[United]] [[States]] when the Civil [[War]] began, enlisted in the northern
army. There is a brief overview in Damien-Claude Bélanger, Franco-[[America]]ns in the
Civil [[War]] Era ([[1861]]–[[1865]]) (Montreal: n.p., [[2001]]).

are all pretty unreliable.

58. As Paul Quigley points out, “If the [[America]]n [[South]] did not possess a straightforward or pure nationalism, neither does anyone else.” Shifting Grounds: Nationalism
and the [[America]]n [[South]], [[1848]]–[[1865]] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, [[2010]]), 8.
Quigley also argues that “nationalism at this time can be described as evolving from
the liberal, inclusive ‘civic’ model embodied in the [[French]] and [[America]]n Revolutions
toward the conservative, exclusive ‘ethnic’ model that culminated in the fascism
of the mid-twentieth century” (8). This was also the case in [[Canada]]; see Timothy J.
Stanley, “‘The Aryan Character of the Future of [[British]] [[North]] [[America]]’: Macdonald,
[[Chinese]] Exclusion and the Invention of [[Canadian]] White Supremacy,” in Dutil and Hall,
Macdonald at 200, 115–40.
59. Eric Kaufman has argued that in every nation there is a dominant ethnic community that believes “the ‘nation’ to be ‘its’ nation and is politically hegemonic” and that
in English [[Canada]] that nation was composed of [[British]] Protestants, “an amalgam of
people of [[Scottish]], [[Irish]], English, and Welsh ancestry” who “identified their ethnicity
as irreducibly [[British]].” Eric Kaufman, “The Orange Order in [[Ontario]], [[New]]foundland,
[[Scotland]] and [[North]]ern [[Ireland]], a Macro-Social Analysis,” in The Orange Order in
[[Canada]], ed. David Wilson ([[Dublin]]: Four Courts, [[2007]]), 107. Most Orangemen certainly saw Protestantism and [[British]]ness as interrelated, but the concept of [[British]]ness
could also be stretched, and frequently was, even by moderate Orangemen, to include
“loyal” [[Irish]] Catholics.

71. Historians have paid almost no attention to the fiscal arrangements agreed on
at [[Quebec]] that effectively crippled the provinces—especially the smaller provinces—
after [[1867]]. E. A. Heaman notes, “When Macdonald anticipated that Confederation
would eventually reduce the provinces to the status of municipal [[government]]s, it is
not unlikely that he based his predictions on fiscal arrangements.” See “Macdonald
and Fiscal Realpolitik,” in Dutil and Hall, Macdonald at 200, 197, 199. Creighton, of
course, understood the implications of these fiscal arrangements since he had prepared a major report on the topic for the Royal Commission on Dominion–Provincial
Relations in [[1938]].
