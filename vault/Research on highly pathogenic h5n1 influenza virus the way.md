**ABSTRACT
The voluntary #moratorium on #gain-of-function [[research]] related to the #transmissibility of highly [[pathogenic]] [[[[H5N1]]]]
[[in[[flu]]enza]] [[[[virus]]]] should continue, pending the resolution of critical policy questions concerning the rationale for performing such
[[[[experiment]]s]] and how best to report their results. The potential #benefits and risks of these [[[[experiment]]s]] must be discussed and
understood by multiple stakeholders, including the general #public, and all decisions regarding such [[research]] must be made in a
#transparent manner.**

### The in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] [[research]] community is to be 
commended for implementing a voluntary moratorium on “[[gain-of-
function]]” [[[[experiment]]s]] related to the #transmissibility of highly
#pathogenic #[[H5N1]] #in[[flu]]enza #[[virus]] (1). As a key funder of #in[[flu]]enza
[[virus]] #[[research]], the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
[[Disease]]s, a component of the [[U.S. National Institutes of Health]],
strongly supports the continuation of this #moratorium pending
the resolution of critical #policy #issues related to the rationale for
performing and reporting such [[[[experiment]]s]]. We need to be cer-
tain that the fundamental purposes of this work, together with its
risks and benefits, are understood by multiple #stakeholders, in-
cluding the general #public, and that decisions are made in a trans-
parent manner.
It is clear that the scientists who conducted the [[[[experiment]]s]]
that triggered this debate (2, 3), and who are among those who
voluntarily signed onto the moratorium, have conducted their
[[research]] properly and under the safest and most secure condi-
tions. However, the issue that has been intensely debated is
whether knowledge obtained from these [[[[experiment]]s]] could inad-
vertently affect public health in an adverse way, even in nations
multiple [[time zones]] away. Putting aside the specter of bioterror-
ism for the moment, consider this hypothetical scenario: an im-
portant #gain-of-function [[experiment]] involving a [[virus]] with seri-
ous [[pandemic]] potential is performed in a well-regulated, world-
class laboratory by experienced investigators, but the information
from the [[experiment]] is then used by another scientist who does
not have the same training and facilities and is not subject to the
same regulations. In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events,
what if that #scientist becomes #infected with the #[[virus]], which leads
to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a [[pandemic]]? Many ask rea-
sonable questions: given the possibility of such a scenario—how-
ever #remote—should the initial #[[[[experiment]]s]] have been performed
and/or published in the first place, and what were the processes
involved in this decision?
### Scientists working in this field might say—as indeed I have said—that the benefits 
of such #[[[[experiment]]s]] and the resulting knowledge #outweigh the #risks.
It is more likely that a #[[pandemic]]
would occur in #nature, and the need to stay ahead of such a threat
is a primary reason for performing an [[experiment]] that might ap-
pear to be risky. However, we must respect that there are genuine
and legitimate #concerns about this type of [[research]], both domes-
tically and globally. We cannot expect those who have these con-
cerns to simply take us, the scientific community, at our word that
the benefits of this work outweigh the risks, nor can we ignore
their calls for greater #transparency, their concerns about conflicts
of interest, and their efforts to engage in a dialog about whether
these #[[[[experiment]]s]] should have been performed in the first place.
Those of us in the scientific community who believe in the merits
of this work have the #responsibility to address these concerns
thoughtfully and respectfully.
### Granted, the time it takes to engage in such a dialog could
potentially delay or even immobilize the conduct of certain im-
portant [[[[experiment]]s]] and the publication of valuable information
that could move the field forward for the good of public health.
Within the [[research]] community, many have expressed concern
that important [[research]] progress could come to a halt just because
of the fear that someone, somewhere, might attempt to replicate
these [[[[experiment]]s]] sloppily. This is a valid concern. However, al-
though #in[[flu]]enza [[[[virus]]]] scientists are the best-informed individuals
about in[[flu]]enza #[[virus]] [[science]], and possibly even about the true
level of risk to public health, the [[in[[flu]]enza [[virus]]]] [[research]] commu-
nity can no longer be the only player in the discussion of whether
certain [[[[experiment]]s]] should be done. #Public opinion (domestic
and global) and the judgments of independent biosafety and bio-
security experts are also critical. If we want to continue this im-
portant work, we collectively need to do a better job of articulating
the scientific rationale for such [[[[experiment]]s]] well before they are
performed and provide discussion about the potential risk to pub-
lic health, however remote. We must also not rule out the possi-
bility that in the course of these discussions, a broad #consensus
might be reached that certain #[[[[experiment]]s]] actually should not be
conducted or reported.
In this regard, as part of an interagency process, the [[U.S. Gov-
ernment]] is planning to augment current policy guidance related
to life [[science]]s dual-use [[research]] of concern (DURC) (4) by devel-
oping a framework for strengthening regular institutional review
and oversight of certain life [[science]]s [[research]] with high-
consequence pathogens and toxins in order to identify potential
DURC and mitigate risks where appropriate. This #policy imple-
mentation proposal will go well beyond [[[[H5N1]]]] [[in[[flu]]enza [[virus]]]] to

include 15 pathogens and likely will be modified to include addi-
tional examples of DURC. It will delineate the procedures for the
oversight of DURC and the responsibilities of investigators, re-
search institutions, and the U.S. Government. Ultimately, there
will also be a companion guide to help institutions identify, assess,
manage, and responsibly communicate to the public about
DURC.
With regard to the specific question of whether certain gain-
of-function [[[[experiment]]s]] related to the transmissibility of highly
pathogenic [[H5N1]] in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] should be conducted at all,
which addresses directly the issue of the moratorium, the U.S.
Government is planning to host an international workshop before
the end of [[2012]] with important input from the National [[Science]]
Advisory Board for Biosecurity and with global representation,
including those with biosafety and biosecurity expertise, in[[flu]]enza
[[virus]] and non-in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] scientists, and [[representative]]s of the
domestic and global public. The meeting participants will con-
sider general principles concerning the rationale for and risks and
benefits of such [[[[experiment]]s]] and what lines might be drawn in
their conduct and/or reporting.
The game has changed for in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] scientists and the
agencies that support them. As [[research]]ers, we must realize that
we are critical players in the process of policy and decision making
related to DURC, but we are not the only players. Before embark-
ing on certain types of [[research]], we must ask ourselves critical


questions about whether there are alternative ways to answer the
[[research]] questions at hand. When no reasonable alternatives exist,
we must take the scientific approach to making the argument for
conducting such [[[[experiment]]s]] before they are performed. The vol-
untary moratorium on the controversial issue of gain-of-function
[[research]] related to the transmissibility of highly pathogenic H5N
in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] is providing us the time and space we all need to
work together and get this right, and it should be continued until
we do so (5).
