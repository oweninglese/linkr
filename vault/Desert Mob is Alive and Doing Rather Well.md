Guest post by Glenn Manser
 
 [Note: Glenn first reached out to me in [[January]] [[2006]], about three months after 
I started this blog. Since then he has been a faithful correspondent, exchanging
perspectives on trends in [[Aboriginal]] art, the performance of the market, and the
characters encountered on our ways. He’s sent me probably hundreds of newspaper 
stories (of the internet kind) over the years. Oddly, we’ve never really met: as
I said a couple of weeks ago on Facebook, we’ve howdied but we haven’t shook. 
The closest we’ve come to a face-to-face meeting was a greeting shouted across 
the forecourt of MAGNT at the NATSIAAs in [[2008]] (I think that was the year) as I 
was getting in a car to catch a lift to the Botanical Gardens and he was lining 
up to enter the exhibition. So it gives me great pleasure to move our 
collaboration up another notch with this report from Desert Mob and Alice 
Springs. You can read more about Glenn’s passions in this recent QAGOMA blog 
post[1].]
 
As I left the plane at Alice Springs Airport over a fortnight ago for the Desert
Mob weekend, I was reminded of Duncan’s words in Macbeth:
 
  …the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses 
 
Fortunately my experience of Desert Mob was vastly more pleasing than Duncan’s 
visit to Glamis.
 
When Desert Mob is discussed, it should be in its widest context. Not only is it
the actual exhibition at the Araluen Centre, the symposium and Marketplace but 
also the ac[[company]]ing exhibitions at Papunya Tula Artists, Talapi Gallery and 
Raft Artspace. Collectively they provide a density of experience of [[Western]] 
Desert art that is not replicated anywhere.
 
After a four year hiatus, I wasn’t quite sure what to expect from this Desert 
Mob weekend. As usual, Araluen Cultural Precinct Director Tim Rollason had 
everything running ship shape and Curator Stephen Williamson again did an 
impressive job with the hang. (All entries in the exhibition can be found at 
Desert Mob 2[[014]] | Desart[2].)
 
The key to this Thursday afternoon is to purchase the catalogue, queue, wait for
the opening pleasantries to pass and then scamper into the galleries, do a quick
reconnoitre and pluck the appropriate ticket from the item or items you wish to 
purchase. There is no time to think, consider, evaluate. With over 31 art 
centres spread throughout three galleries, it is important to be tactical as to 
which gallery is chosen to sprint to first.
 
Gallery 1 seemed to offer an interesting combination of art centres. It was the 
ceramics rather than the paintings that immediately caught the eye. The 
juxtaposition of the Ernabella and Hermannsburg displays highlighted the 
divergent styles that have emerged at both centres. Alison Carroll’s beautifully
marked stoneware, Ngayuku Walka, reminiscent of her prize winning piece in the 
Shepparton 2[[014]] Ceramic Art Award (Alison Carroll – Shepparton Art Museum[3]) 
stood imperiously in all its jade coloured glory. Amusingly nearby, and acquired
by the Araluen, was Rona Rubuntja’s Artist Car, an earthenware, paper clay and 
underglazes rendition of the great Albert Namatjira’s ute, in a well-worn, 
outback green.

[image 2: dmgm2 (link #7)][6]
 
Again it was the Ernabella paintings that next took the eye with a beautifully 
executed hazy [[gold]]en piece by Yurpiya Lionel, a fine Rupert Jack and an 
elongated yet warmly textured Wanampi by Gordon Ingkatji, also acquired by the 
Araluen. Other pieces of note included a husband and wife collaboration by 
Tjungu Palya artists, Keith and Tjampawa Stevens and a superb representation of 
Punyunya by Spinifex artist, Fred Grant.
 
[image 3: dmgm3 (link #9)][8]Equally fascinating was up-and-coming Iwantja 
artist Vincent Namatjira’s insightful execution of The Idulkana Tigers, 
spotlighting the transformative role [[Australia]]n Rules Football (AFL) plays in 
the lives of young, outback [[Indigenous]] men.
 
The Papunya Tula Artists selection was again a collection of masterful smaller 
pieces that segued beautifully to its own gallery hang. The Morris Gibson 
Tjapaltjarri, Ray James Tjangala and Mantua Nangala, in particular, stood out. 
Across the aisle new Papunya Tjupi Arts’ coordinator Helen Puckey had also 
assembled a collection of praiseworthy pieces including a subtly complex piece 
in muted yellows by Isobel Gorey Nampitjinpa and a Doris [[Bush]] Nungarrayi 
kaleidoscopic rendition of women searching for bush food.
 
The Tjanpi Desert Weavers displays were a big hit with extravagant collections 
of emu, wedge-tailed eagles and an assortment of other birds executed in raffia,
feathers, acrylic yarn and wire dominating the floor space. A profusion of red 
dots was quick testimony to their popularity.
 
Unfortunately, and it pains me to say it, but the [[War]]layirti Artists’ exhibition
was just plain disappointing. While there were some old favourites, including 
Bai Bai Napangardi and Helicopter Tjungurrayi, it was the sameness of the 
selection, even after a four year absence, that really surprised. Hopefully with
new coordinators in place, this art centre can bring on some of the younger 
artists and regain some of Balgo’s former glory.
 
Gallery 3 and the smaller Sitzler Gallery proved to be less even in their 
offerings but there were some jewels to be found.
 
[image 4: dmgm4 (link #11)][10] Tjala Arts again dominated with a profusion of 
large canvasses including a memorable senior women’s collaboration titled 
Nganampa Ngura. It was with much sadness that during the exhibition news reached
Alice Springs that Kunmanara Williamson, one of the collaborating artists, had 
passed away.
 
It was a playfully collaborative work of acrylic on linen together with spinifex
fibre and raffia-like reptiles by [[May]] Pan and Iluwanti Ken that generated 
interest and good humoured banter.
 
Kayili Artists made a memorable return with a series of 80 x 60cm boards with 
Mrs [[War]]d and Nola Campbell, in particular, delivering very strong works in 
shimmering colours. Not to be outdone Tjarlirli Art provided two striking works;
an abstracted piece in muted browns and infused blues by Bob Gibson and a 
delicious mixture of swirling reds, oranges and greens in Nyarapayi Giles’s 
[[War]]murrungu.
 
[image 5: dmgm5 (link #13)][12]
 
A diverse collection by Martumili Artists provided two impressive pieces by 
Jakayu Biljabu and the evergreen Nora Wompi.
 
It was in the Sitzler Gallery that opening night, by then, drew to a conclusion.
Watercolours by Kevin Namatjira and Reinhold Inkamala stood out with the 
latter’s brooding atmospherics characteristic of his emerging style.

For an alternative perspective on opening day and the symposium that followed, 
Kieran Finnane always provides insightful commentary – Desert Mob: This is who 
we are – Alice Springs [[New]]s[16].
 
As previously mentioned the weekend was enriched with three quality exhibitions 
at Papunya Tula Artists, Kate Podger’s Talapi Gallery and Dallas Gold’s Raft 
Artspace, all nicely segued to sections of the Desert Mob exhibition.
 
Papunya Tula Artists has been Alice Springs’ epicentre for Central [[Australia]]n 
[[Indigenous]] art, recently celebrating 40 years of service to its shareholders, 
principally the Pintupi people. To coincide with Desert Mob, Manager Paul 
Sweeney and team rehung the gallery and what a fine, carefully nuanced 
exhibition it was.
 
The stylistic changes in Morris Gibson’s latest works were evident and a 
sequential development from his rectangular, richly hued piece in Desert Mob 
obvious.
 
[image 7: dmgm7 (link #18)][17]
 
Nearby was a mini exhibition of contemporary pieces, large and small, by 
Yinarupa Nangala finely juxtaposed to emphasise her command of space and minimal
use of colour to evoke country.
 
[image 8: dmgm8 (link #20)][19]
 
It was a real treat to meet Patrick Tjungurray again as he sat quietly in the 
gallery. Six or so years had passed since he had graced the gallery in a triumph
of the Tjungurrayis, surrounded by a gaggle of admiring relatives and 
collectors. Now the ravages of time and ill [[health]] were evident. A small but 
significant selection of his work, however, referenced his enduring strength as 
an artist and a chronicler of his country and its stories. Thoughtfully 
juxtaposed next to the colour and vibrancy of Tjungurrayi’s work were several by
Ray James Tjangala. The four or so works by Tjangala provided a compositional 
point of comparison between these two great exponents of [[Western]] Desert art. As 
Sweeney commented, “The work by Ray is undoubtedly typical of him. It’s tight 
with a quirky twist. I believe a good Ray has a bit of something left field in 
it which this one does.”
 
[image 9: dmgm9 (link #22)][21]
 
Of course there was much more to admire in the gallery including mini solos by 
Nunyuma Napangati, Josephine Nangala and Kawayi Nampitjinpa and a veritable 
feast of attractive smaller 61 x 31cm pieces that adorned the gallery’s main 
wall.
 
Entering Kate Podger’s Talapi Gallery, just up the mall, presented an immediate 
kaleidoscopic contrast to Papunya Tula with a hang of largely Tjungu Palya 
sourced work on the walls. A profusion of bright reds, greens, blues and 
everything in between greeted you in her “Desert Colour” exhibition. A 
gorgeously rich Iyawi Wikilyiri, a small but equally sumptuous Maringka Baker, a
Helen Curtis composition of color contrasts, Keturah Zimran’s bold colour fields
and a richly rendered Betty Kuntiwa Pumani from Mimili Maku Arts, among many 
others, gazed at you from the walls.
 
[image 10: dmgm10 (link #24)][23]
 
Kate, former curator at the Araluen Cultural Centre and manager of Ros Premont’s
Gallery Gondwana, always brings a depth of knowledge and commentary to any 
discussion about the qualities of paintings and artists. The set of paintings 
chosen for the exhibition beautifully complimented the larger collaborative 
Tjungu Palya and Mimili Maku pieces in Desert Mob.
 
[image 11: dmgm11 (link #26)][25]
 
The third exhibition to round out the Desert Mob weekend was at Dallas Gold’s 
Raft Artspace and what an experience it was. In the split gallery there was 
Carlene West’s first solo and also an Ernabella ceramics exhibition.
 
In the ac[[company]]ing glossy catalogue, Claire Eltringham said of West’s 
paintings;
 
  The simplistic compositions boast vast gaping spaces in high contrast colours,
  the curves are seductive and freeform, the artist’s marks resolute and 
  undaunted…To the naked eye, this is an expansive salt lake, without 
  vegetation, pale but mesmerising with only the tracks in the sand capturing 
  any movement…This is Spinifex country-raw, unforgiving and expansive… as a 
  stand -alone body of work, these paintings are avant-garde and mesmeric.
 
Given the number of red dots circling the gallery, collectors agreed with Gold’s
uncanny ability to unearth new talent, even if West has been painting since the 
Spinifex Project actually began. He was his self-effacing self when describing 
the virtues of both exhibitions to the assembled audience.
 
[image 12: dmgm12 (link #28)][27]
 
Indeed, the sensation was as if one was absorbed into those vast expanses that 
provide the inspiration for West’s paintings.
 
Just as amazing were the ceramics that made up the Ernabella Arts Tjulpirpa wiya
– clay! Not mud-clay exhibition in the smaller gallery. Composed entirely of 
works by male artists, this stunning exhibition presented works of quality and 
imagination. Following on from the highly successful key note exhibition Tjungu 
[[War]]karintja, Fifteen Years | sabbia gallery[29], the decision to concentrate on 
the male artists was inspired and well received.
 
[image 13: dmgm13 (link #31)][30]
 
The talented Ngunytjima Carroll throws most of the pots at Ernabella but rarely 
marks them. His two pieces in this exhibition reflected not only his ability to 
shape but also to mark strongly and creatively. Equally, Derek Jungarrayi 
Thompson, Pepai Carroll and Andy Paul Tjutjuna bring their own gifts to pot 
marking. Thompson has a beautifully refined, even delicate aesthetic to his 
interpretation of the Wanampi Tjukurpa, Pepai Carroll marks his Walungurru 
strongly yet conservatively and Andy Paul Tjutjuna, both in his Desert Mob and 
Raft pieces, boldly works in shades of black, occasionally infusing blues into 
his Kalaya Tjukurpa.

Is Desert Mob still the artistic counterpart to Telstra, the National [[Aboriginal]]
and Torres Strait Islander Art Award, it once was? Well, if the experiences 
above are any indication, it is not only alive but definitely doing very well 
indeed. When the [[Indigenous]] art community puts its mind to it, there is nothing 
better than Desert Mob in Alice Springs.
