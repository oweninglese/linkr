TOWARDS SHARED OWNERSHIP:

PROPERTY, GEOGRAPHY, AND TREATY
MAKING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA
by

Brian Egan

EGAN, B. ([[2013]]): 'Towards shared ownership: [[property]], geography, and [[treaty]] making in [[British]] Columbia', Ģeogrāfiskā Annaler:
Series B, Human Geography 95 ( 1 ): 33-50.

ABSTRACT. In [[British]] Columbia, [[Canada]]'s westernmost province, unresolved [[Aboriginal]] claims to land remain highly contentious. Since the early [[1990]]s, a unique [[treaty]] negotiation process
has sought to resolve questions about land ownership and establish a new relationship between [[Aboriginal]] peoples and the [[Crown]].
After almost two decades, the limitations of this [[treaty]] process are
increasingly evident and answers to the land question remain elusive. This article examines this [[treaty]]-making process through a
[[property]] lens, focusing on how particular models of [[property]] are
privileged by and produced through this approach to [[treaty]]. I argue
that the [[treaty]] process, as currently structured, works to entrench

most of the province. This uncertainty over land

ownership in [[Canada]]'s westernmost province,

heightened by an effective [[Aboriginal]] land claims
movement, led to the creation, in the early [[1990]]s,
of a unique [[treaty]]-making process. Under this process, three parties - [[Canada]], [[British]] Columbia and
[[Aboriginal]] groups - seek to negotiate modern comprehensive [[treaties]] to clearly define [[Aboriginal]] and
[[Crown]] rights to land and natural resources. By resolving the land question, and establishing a form of
[[Aboriginal]] self-governance, the [[treaty]] process was
to help create 'a new relationship based on mutual

dominant [[Western]] forms of [[property]] across [[Aboriginal]] territories
in a highly separate and unequal manner, and as such, serves to reinscribe asymmetrical relations of power between [[Aboriginal]] peoples and the [[Crown]]. To a considerable extent, this asymmetrical
approach to [[property]] making explains the lack of progress towards
[[treaties]]. The final part of the article explores alternative approaches to [[treaty]] proposed by [[Aboriginal]] groups. I argue that these proposals, which reflect [[Aboriginal]] understandings of [[property]], offer
a new and more promising direction for [[treaty]] making. In particular, the emphasis on sharing lands and resources, as well as the
wealth generated from these, provides a path to reconcile competing [[property]] interests and to build a new and more respectful relationship between the [[Crown]] and [[Aboriginal]] peoples. I suggest that
the difficulties of [[treaty]] making in [[British]] Columbia reflect broader challenges associated with land restitution and reconciliation in

are also significant differences between [[Crown]] and
[[Aboriginal]] negotiators over issues such as the nature of [[Aboriginal]] self-governance, the application
of federal and provincial laws, and inter[[government]]al fiscal relations - all key elements of modern
[[treaties]] (BC [[Treaty]] Commission [[2008]]). The framing of [[treaty]] making as a process focused on establishing a new relationship for the future, rather
than one concerned with addressing past injustices,
is problematic for many First Nations. The failure
to address the colonial past in any meaningful way
means that compensation for historic infringement
of [[Aboriginal]] title and rights, something of importance to many First Nations, is not on the table for
negotiation (Day and Sadik [[2002]]).

how this certainty is to be accomplished. From a
[[Crown]] perspective, [[treaty]] making is seen as a tool
to transform [[Aboriginal]] title - which it views as an
ill-defined and geographically amorphous [[property]]
claim - into a more certain and spatially delimited
set of [[property]] rights. Final [[treaty]] agreements clearly
set out the land and resource rights of the [[Aboriginal]]

signatories in exhaustive detail and in highly legal-

istic and technical language. Through these agreements, "[[treaty]] settlement lands" - which include
existing [[Indian]] reserves and any additional lands
identified in the [[treaty]] - are designated as properties
owned by the [[Aboriginal]] signatory in fee simple.

The [[treaty]] process is based on what is called a
land selection model, whereby the [[Crown]] identifies
parcels of land within a First Nation's traditional territory that may be included in a [[treaty]]. Through the
negotiation process, a subset of these lands is then selected for inclusion in the final [[treaty]] agreement. It is

[[2007]]).
While [[treaties]] transform [[Aboriginal]] title into a
kind of [[property]] that meshes more smoothly with
the [[Canadian]] legal system, the [[Crown]] also works to
shield some forms of [[property]] from the negotiation

process altogether. [[Canada]] and [[British]] Columbia
have both asserted that they will not expropriate private [[property]] in order to settle [[treaties]]. In addition,

[[British]] Columbia has committed itself to ensuring
that private interests in [[Crown]] lands, such as commercial tenures to extract natural resources (e.g. timber, water, minerals), will not be negatively affected
by [[treaties]]. Where such adverse effects are unavoidable, the provincial [[government]] has committed itself to fair and timely compensation of these rights

holders ([[British]] Columbia [[1996]]).

Although most First Nations have no desire to see private lands expropriated, a number
of [[Aboriginal]] groups argue that the issue of private [[property]] should be open for discussion at the
[[treaty]] table. This is particularly true for [[Aboriginal]]

groups in more intensively developed areas of the
province, whose territories have been subject to ex-

tensive land and resource privatization. For these
groups, the [[Crown]]'s historic sale or granting of land
in their traditional territories to private individuals
and corporations, without their prior consent, is understood as an illegal taking of their [[property]]. Like
any other [[property]] owner, they argue, they should
be compensated for the taking of their land. Indeed,
some argue that their [[Aboriginal]] title continues to
exist on private lands and that they should be con-

sulted when land use decisions are contemplated,
especially when it comes to managing important
cultural sites (e.g. burial grounds). The [[Crown]], however, has clearly stated that it will not compensate
©

The

package of land and other material benefits (e.g.
cash, resource access) offered to [[Aboriginal]] groups
in [[British]] Columbia through [[treaty]] varies from place

to place, depending on factors such as the price of
land, the local availability of natural resources, and
the size (population) of the [[Aboriginal]] group. At
each [[treaty]] table in the province, [[Crown]] negotia-

tors work within an overall "financial mandate" that

determines the size of this package in gross monetary terms. In negotiating [[treaties]] across the province, the [[Crown]] seeks to offer all [[Aboriginal]] groups
a roughly similar set of benefits, in terms of the gross

monetary value of the package on a per capita basis

(Proverbs [[2010]]).
This standardized approach to [[treaty]] making,
wherein all [[Aboriginal]] groups are offered [[treaty]]
benefits of the same gross financial value on a per
capita basis, means that the extent to which [[treaties]]
expand [[Aboriginal]] space varies from place to place.
Where market land values are very high, as in urban
or suburban areas, the amount of land offered will be

small, whereas in rural areas [[treaty]] agreements will
include a much larger allocation of land. The two final agreements completed under the [[treaty]] process
to date illustrate the extent to which real [[property]]
values shape the size of the land offer. In the case of
the Tsawwassen [[treaty]], covering an area just south
of [[Vancouver]], the [[treaty]] yielded 1.2 hectares of new
land (on a per capita basis) for the Tsawwassen First
Nation. For the Maa-nulth First Nations, located on
the remote west coast of [[Vancouver]] Island, the [[treaty]]

provided about 8 hectares of new land on a per cap-

ita basis.

This technical calculation of the amount of

land allocated to [[Aboriginal]] groups through [[treaty]]

is shaped by the [[Crown]]'s broader objective of
