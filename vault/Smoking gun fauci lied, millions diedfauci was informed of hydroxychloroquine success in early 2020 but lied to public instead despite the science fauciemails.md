It’s been over a year since the WHO declared the [[corona[[virus]]]] a [[pandemic]] after originally downplaying the threat.  It is no secret that both the disease and the response to combat it following this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in late [[2019]] have turned our world upside-down.  Mandates, [[lockdown]]s, and guidelines seem to change every time Dr. [[Fauci]] opens his mouth.   All of these unprecedented rules were put into place, we were told, to slow down the spread of a disease that today is linked to the [[death]] of over half a million [[American]]s and [3.7 million](https://www.worldometers.info/[[corona[[virus]]]]/) global citizens in the last year.

You would think that researchers would have concentrated on prophylactic and therapeutic solutions of this disease especially since this disease is a [[death]] sentence for the elderly, the obese, those with preexisting conditions.  The [[corona[[virus]]]] doctors have forced [[child]]ren to avoid school, mask up, and get vaccinated.  One would think that after all this time there would be a consensus in the hospitals, in the nursing homes, and in other [[treatment]] centers on how to treat a [[Covid]] positive patient or resident.  This is not the case.

**There still is no agreed-upon [[treatment]] plan for elderly patients who catch [[corona[[virus]]]] to assist in their _recovery._**

**The [[CDC]] and Dr. [[Fauci]] ignored [[treatment]] plans for [[corona[[virus]]]] patients unless the person was under severe distress.**

**TRENDING:** [EXCLUSIVE: Garland Favorito Says Georgia Officials Including Raffensperger Concealed Ballot Tampering from Judge - "We Are Discussing What to Do With It" (AUDIO)](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/06/exclusive-garland-favorito-says-georgia-officials-including-raffensperger-concealed-ballot-tampering-judge-discussing-audio/)

Cardiologist and Professor of Medicine Peter McCullough testified in Texas earlier this year. Dr. McCullough sees [[COVID]] patients and says 85% of [[COVID]] patients given multi-drug [[treatment]] plan recover from the disease with complete [[immunity]]. McCullough added, “The [[pandemic]] could have been over by now, he says, if those who tested positive for covid had been immediately treated before they fell ill enough to be hospitalized. He also says that thousands could have been, and still could be saved if the [[treatment]] protocol he and other physicians use were not suppressed.”

Dr. [[Fauci]] and the [[CDC]] and WHO suppressed this effective [[treatment]] plan and others.

**And hundreds of thousands of innocents [[died]].**

And now this…  
The [c19hcq.com](https://c19hcq.com/) website tracks all of the international studies on hydroxychloroquine and its effects on the [[corona[[virus]]]].

There is now a new study and the results are SHOCKING!  
— [HCQ for [[COVID]]-19: real-time meta analysis of 245 studies](https://c19hcq.com/)

HCQ is not effective when used very late with high dosages over a long period (RECOVERY/SOLIDARITY), effectiveness improves with earlier usage and improved dosing. **But early [[treatment]] consistently shows positive effects.  That’s the [[science]].**

**The numbers are astounding!**

**\*\* Hydroxychloroquine worked on [[COVID]]-19 last spring.  
\*\* Hydroxychloroquine worked on [[COVID]]-19 last fall.  
\*\* Hydroxychloroquine worked on [[COVID]]-19 last winter.  
\*\* Hydroxychloroquine works on [[COVID]]-19 today.**

**Dr. [[Fauci]] and the [[CDC]] banned HCQ as a [[treatment]] for [[corona[[virus]]]].**  
**They lied about its effects.**  
**They lied about its dangers.**

TGP contributor Larry Johnson [touched on this](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/06/fauci-fiddled-corona-spread-like-wildfire/) on Wednesday night and took excerpts from [Headline [[USA]]](https://headlineusa.com/fauci-schmooze-cbs-ignore-trump/?utm_source=H[[USA]]email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=H[[USA]]email)‘s reports on Dr. [[Fauci]]’s emails regarding hydroxychloroquine.

> But the e-mails also showed that [[Fauci]] was more in the loop than he let on concerning some of the [[Trump]] administration’s proposed [[treatment]] solutions.
> 
> He notoriously second-guessed then-[[President]] [[Donald]] [[Trump]] during a press conference statement about the benefits of using [hydroxychloroquine](https://headlineusa.com/tag/hydroxychloroquine).

> [[Fauci]] refuted [[President]] [[Trump]] in a White House press conference on March 25:

> **Although [[Fauci]] seemed taken aback and insisted that the “anecdotal” claims had yet to be conclusively stu[[died]], a month earlier he had been looped into [an email to Pence](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails#document/p153) on Feb. 29 in which a pair of Oklahoma physicians extensively discussed their research on it.**
> 
> [[Fauci]] also responded to a [Feb. 24 inquiry](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20793561-leopold-nih-foia-anthony-fauci-emails#document/p456) that noted that [[China]] had been reporting about its clinical studies with the drug.
> 
> “Is there any indication/data to substantiate this claim from [[China]] (attached publication) that chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine can decrease [[COVID]]-19 infections and lung disease?” wrote Maryland pharmacologist Philip Gatti.
> 
> [[Fauci]]’s passive reply echoed what he would later convey on the national stage.
> 
> “There are no data in this brief report and so I have no way of evaluating their claim,” he wrote dismissively.
> 
> “There are a lot of these types of claims going around,” he continued. “I would love to see their data.”

**Then in [[May]] Dr. [[Fauci]] told CNN that hydroxychloroquine was actually “dangerous” and ineffective.**

**Dr. [[Fauci]]  told CNN hydroxychloroquine was actually dangerous when used as a prophylactic against [[corona[[virus]]]].** Hydroxychloroquine had been used safely for 65 years in millions of patients. And so the message was crafted that the drug is safe for its other uses, [but dangerous when used for [[Covid]]-19](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/who-temporarily-halts-trial-hydroxychloroquine-over-safety-concerns-n1214341).

**This statement made headlines throughout the fake new media and it was a complete lie.**

**After [[Fauci]]’s statements on hydroxychloroquine, the tech giants began censoring any mention of the drug. The media mocked [[President]] [[Trump]] and anyone who suggested the drug was safe and effective. [[Doctors]] treating [[corona[[virus]]]] patients were suspended from their social media accounts.**

**And hundreds of thousands of people [[died]].**

**It was all based on a lie perpetrated by Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]].**

What is strange is that Dr. [[Fauci]] [cheered HCQ use](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/[[2020]]/04/wow-dr-fauci-cheered-hydroxychloroquine-success-treating-mers-[[corona[[virus]]]]-[[2013]]-today-skeptical-weird/) for treating the MERS [[corona[[virus]]]] back in [[2013]].  What changed?

**When the [[history]] books are written Dr. Tony [[Fauci]] will go down as one of the greatest mass murderers of our day.**

**He funded the research on [[corona[[virus]]]] in the US. Then he funded it in [[China]] after it was banned here. Then he downplayed the severity of the disease. Then he lied about a successful [[treatment]] for the dangerous man-made pathogen.**

**[[Fauci]] is a [[kill]]er. Arrest [[Fauci]].**

Here are two of the dozens of previous TGP reports on HCQ and its effectiveness.
