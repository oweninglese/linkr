Migration and the

?/wmaking of America
PHIL BELLFY
ANY DISCUSSION of the "Making of North America" must include
some discussion of how the existing "North America" was unmade?it
must be explained how "free land" became available to new immigrants

from [[Europe]]. In [[1492]], the [[Native]] people of the [[Western]] Hemisphere
had a multitude of thriving civilizations, and in the north, a trading

network that stretched from at least central [[Mexico]] to the Great Lakes.

Thousands of autonomous, distinct political nations were extant, and
people spoke hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages. Tzvetlan
Todorov, in his book, The Conquest of America, relates the story of the
Unmaking of Meso-America quite eloquently, most often in the words
of Columbus, [[Cortez]], and others, so that story need not be retold here.1
Also, the depredations of the early New Englanders and the shameful
removal of the southeast tribes are histories that are also relatively easy
to reconstruct.

THE ANISHNABEG
A much less well known [[history]] is the subject of this paper?the
unsuccessful unmaking of the [[indigenous]] civilizations of the Great Lakes

region, specifically, those people we usually refer to as the Chippewa
(or Ojibway), the [[Ottawa]]^ and the Potawatomi. Less often, these three
tribes are collectively referred to as The Three Fires Confederacy. In
their language, they refer to themselves as the Anishnabeg (with variant

spellings and dialect differences) which is the term I will use in this
essay. While meanings in English vary, most definitions of the word
encompass the concepts of "Original Man" or simply "The People," as
is true of great numbers of self-named [[indigenous]] tribes.2

As is the case with most [[Indigenous]] peoples, the land was not sepa
rable from who they were, in both the cultural and the physical sense.

True to this imperative, the Anishnabeg viewed the land as part of
them?and they as part of it. The Biblical precepts of "Be fruitful, and

multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it," were, and are, as

foreign to them as were the concepts of monotheism and a vengeful
deity. This is not to say that the [[Native]] people of the region had no
concepts of what we might now call private ownership; but certainly the
concept of ownership did not extend to the natural resources of the area.

The Anishnabeg did authorize families to access the resources of
certain delimited winter hunting grounds, and there certainly were inter

tribal wars fought over overlapping claims to territory. But in these
cases, the key was access, not ownership, and the decisions governing
mira-tribal access were arrived at through consensus. It was very much
a part of the ethos to grant access to others based on their need and the
bounty of the area. We will see how this philosophy is later applied to

the [[Europe]]ans.
At the time of post-[[1492]] contact, the Anishnabeg occupied much of
the northern Great Lakes from what is now eastern [[Ontario]] to Lake

[[Winnipeg]] and south into Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.3 By
[[1776]], they had expanded their territory south into what is now northern
Ohio, [[Indian]]a, and Illinois, occupying land which completely surrounded

all of the Great Lakes with the exception of the areas south of Lake
[[Ontario]] (occupied by the Iroquois Confederacy). Many contact-era tribes
of the region were as decimated by disease and warfare as their tradi
tional ways of life were threatened by the arrival of [[Europe]]ans and the
fur [[trade]] regime's erosion of their self-sufficiency. While they too suf
fered, the Anishnabeg managed to expand into territories abandoned by
others or gained through warfare (notably pushing the Iroquois back to
the shores of Lake [[Ontario]] and taking control of those areas the Iroquois
[[conquer]]ed during their campaigns to control the area's fur [[trade]]).

PONTIAC'S "WAR"
As the waning Iroquois in[[flu]]ence in the western Great Lakes was
taken up by the Anishnabeg, and the French trading regime gave way to
[[British]] interests in [[1760]], the Anishnabeg were faced with another threat
to their homelands and [[sovereignty]]. The trading regime of the French

was much more generous than that of the [[British]], and soon after the
[[British]] took over the Great Lakes [[trade]], the [[Ottawa]] chief Pontiac and his

allies set out to confront [[British]] power and [[trade]] practices in the Spring

of [[1763]]. Often mislabeled as a [[rebellion]] or a conspiracy, Pontiac's
action should be more honestly referred to as "a vigorous defense of the

homeland." While the [[history]] books refer to Pontiac's "[[War]]" as a fail
ure, from the perspective of the Anishnabeg, the campaign was a success.

Pontiac built on an earlier "Pan-[[Indian]]" [[alliance]] formed under the
Iroquois, which was active from the early [[1700]]s to mid-century. It was

successful in bringing together an impressive array of tribes which?
despite the failure to continue the siege of Detroit?forced the [[British]] to
reestablish the more liberal [[trade]] policies of the French. Pontiac and his
allies essentially forced the [[British]] to recognize that the area's [[Native]]
people were very much in control of their homelands and had the power
to pretty much dictate the terms of [[trade]].

While the French were quite liberal in their [[trade]] policy and rather
inclined to integrate themselves into the [[aboriginal]] way of life, the Brit
ish saw the [[Native]] people as only as the source of the fur [[trade]] wealth
that the area still held in the late eighteenth century. The [[British]] recog
nized that maintaining the [[indigenous]] people in their homelands meant
that the fur [[trade]] regime would continue, at least until the fur-bearing

animals were trapped to scarcity. (The policy of the French seemed to
be more toward sustainability and integration.) The [[British]] attempts to
maintain the fur [[trade]] by keeping the expansionist Colonial settlers on

the [[Atlantic]] side of the Appalachian range?one of the "long train of
abuses and usurpations"?led to the [[American]] Revolution.4
Despite Pontiac's success and [[British]] recognition of the area's Indig
enous power base, the threat of settler expansion soon focused the
Anishnabeg's attention once again on the defense of their homelands.
While not really trusting the [[British]] to defend their interests, they saw
the "[[American]]s" as the much greater threat. "Pontiac's Rebellion" had
eliminated the worst of the [[British]] threat and at the onset of the Revolu

tionary [[War]], the area's [[Native]] people joined with their former [[British]]
enemies to counter what they perceived as a much greater threat?the
[[American]]s and their lust for land. The French integrated; the [[British]]
accommodated; but the [[American]]s seemed determined to take their land,

[[kill]]ing any who stood in their way. The Anishnabeg readily understood
that [[American]] colonial expansion meant a loss of their homelands and a
way of life that had become inexorably tied to the fur [[trade]].

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION
At the onset of the Revolutionary [[War]], [[Native]] people once again
launched a vigorous defense of their homeland. While it is true that
many tribes decided that this was a "fight among brothers" and re
mained neutral, the overwhelming majority of [[Native]] people who chose

to fight did so on the side of the [[British]]. Many Anishnabeg, former

allies of Pontiac, fought the [[American]] colonists in [[battle]]s far to the east
of their homelands. And while the [[British]] did surrender to the colonists,

the Anishnabeg were never defeated. In fact, in a tacit recognition of
[[United]] [[States]] weakness after the war, the [[British]] continued to occupy
their posts in the western Great Lakes, although ostensibly on land
"ceded" to the [[United]] [[States]]. This "cession" was not recognized by the
area's [[Native]] people. In fact, some have claimed that the [[British]] were
forced to maintain their posts as a hedge against an "[[Indian]] uprising,"
threatened in retaliation for the [[British]] capitulation and abandonment of

their [[Native]] allies in the [[1783]] [[Treaty]] of Paris.5 Although the [[British]]
proposal to establish the Northwest [[Territories]] as an "[[Indian]] Buffer
State" between the [[American]]s in the east and the [[British]]-claimed terri

tory west of the Mississippi was soundly rejected by the [[American]]s, the

[[Native]] people of the area viewed the proposal as a treacherous sell-out
of their interests.6

From the perspective of the [[American]]s, the [[Native]] people of the
western Great Lakes were still loyal [[British]] subjects. Of course, they
were nothing of the sort?at the end of the Revolutionary [[War]], they still
held the balance of power in the region and both the [[United]] [[States]] and
Great [[Britain]] fought over their loyalty. The disastrous defeats by [[Native]]
defenders of Harmar in [[1790]] and Saint Clair in [[1791]], showed the fierce
resistance which met the [[American]] military forays into the Great Lakes.
And, as the [[British]] gave only minimal and grudging military aid to their

former allies during this period, the Anishnabeg can be seen as essen
tially autonomous actors, living in, and defending their homeland.
The [[1795]] [[Treaty]] of Amity, Commerce and Navigation was an attempt
by the [[British]] and [[American]] [[government]]s to resolve their differences in

the western Great Lakes region. (The [[Treaty]] is usually referred to as
Jay's [[Treaty]], or the Jay [[Treaty]], named after its chief [[United]] [[States]]
negotiator, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, John Jay.) For the pur

poses of this essay, Article III of the Jay [[Treaty]] is significant. The
Article sets out the terms whereby "His Majesty's subjects ... citizens
of the [[United]] [[States]], and . . . [[Indian]]s dwelling on either side of the said
boundary" can freely carry out "cross-border" [[trade]] without the imposi
tion of import duties (the [[British]], while agreeing to abandon their posts
in territory claimed by the [[United]] [[States]], still hoped to profit from the
area's fur [[trade]] activity). By delineating the three major actors of the

area?the [[British]], the [[American]]s, and the "[[Indian]]s"?Jay's [[Treaty]] rec
ognized the power and distinct character of the area's [[Native]] people
without a regard for the border separating the two [[Europe]]an powers.

Bellfy
Also embedded in the wording is a tacit recognition of the control over
the territory that [[Native]] people exercised, putting them on a par with the

other ([[British]] and [[American]]) interests in the area?[[Native]] people still
held the balance of power. It is also significant that the [[United]] [[States]]
dealt with [[Native]] people by signing [[treaties]] with them?an international
diplomatic necessity when the signatories are sovereign nations, not
fellow citizens.
Jay's [[Treaty]], while at least temporarily keeping the peace between the
[[United]] [[States]] and Great [[Britain]], did little to alleviate the [[Native]] people's
fear of [[American]] aggression. In fact, Jay's [[Treaty]] was being negotiated
as the [[United]] [[States]] Army, under "Mad" Anthony Wayne, was engaging

[[Native]] warriors at the Battle of the Fallen Timbers. This minor [[battle]]
served as the impetus to the controversial [[1795]] [[Treaty]] of Greenville,
which (at least in the eyes of the [[United]] [[States]] [[government]]) ceded a
small portion of "[[Indian]] Country" in Ohio and opened the door to fur
ther expansion and land cessions. Of course, the majority of [[Native]]
people rejected the authority of the Greenville chiefs to sign any land
cession, holding to the prevailing agreement that any land cession re
quired a consensus from all area tribes, a condition well nigh impossible
to meet, which was, of course, its intent.
One of those who did not accept the cessions of the [[Treaty]] of Greenville

was the Shawnee chief Tecumseh who steadfastly maintained that any
decision to cede land must be arrived at by consensus. The [[War]] of [[1812]]

was in large part "Tecumseh's [[War]]" and the [[Native]] people of the area
vigorously supported Tecumseh's efforts and his efforts to re-forge a
Pan-[[Indian]] [[alliance]] to resist the encroachments of the [[American]] colo
nists moving into the Ohio River Valley, traditional Shawnee territory.
[[Native]] people from the entire Northwest [[Territories]] were with Tecumseh's
brother Tenskwatawa at Prophetstown, including a considerable number

of [[Ottawa]], Chippewa, and Potawatomi.7

THE WAR OF [[1812]]
The [[Native]] people were engaged in the [[War]] of [[1812]] for the express
purpose of defending their homeland from a settler invasion which would
obviously alter their way of life and overrun their territories. A [[British]]

military official put it this way: "The Great Spirit smiles on our just
cause, but frowns on that of the deceitful [[American]]s because they have

cruelly oppressed you [and if they win] you will be gradually driven
beyond the setting sun.8

When Tecumseh was [[kill]]ed at the Battle of the Thames in 1814,
several Anishnabeg warriors from as far away as Sault Ste Marie fell
with him, and with his [[death]], the [[War]] was essentially over. Again, the
[[British]] and the [[American]]s forged a peace, and despite assurances by the
[[British]] to the contrary, the [[Native]] people of the area were pretty much
abandoned by them. Instead of supporting their resistance, the [[British]]
told the [[Native]] people to "be on good terms with our neighbors, the Big
Knives" and treat the [[American]] [[trade]]rs with respect.9
As was the case after the [[American]] Revolution, and despite the Brit
ish capitulation, the [[Native]] people of the upper Great Lakes were not

defeated by [[United]] [[States]] forces and indeed both [[United]] [[States]] and
[[British]] forces recognized that [[Native]] people still held the balance of
power in the region. Consequently, both sides established a regime of
giving "presents" to the [[Native]] people of the region in efforts to wrest
the [[Native]]'s loyalty from one side to cement it firmly to the other. The

efforts were not to the advantage of either side. The [[Native]] people
simply took advantage of the rivalry of the [[United]] [[States]] and [[Britain]] by
collecting presents from both sides while continuing to complain to the
[[British]] that the [[American]]s were all?as they feared?overrunning their

homelands.10

REMOVAL AND THE [[1836]] TREATY OF DETROIT
After the [[War]] of [[1812]], the [[Native]] people of the entire eastern Ameri
can territory faced another serious threat?that of Removal. Although
ruled to be illegal by the [[United]] [[States]] Supreme Court, [[President]] Jack
son defied the Court and began the removal of the [[Native]] people from

the Southeast in [[1836]], an event forever remembered as the Trail of
Tears. Other removals took place throughout the territory east of the
Mississippi and the peoples of the Old Northwest were not exempted
form this brutal process. The [[United]] [[States]] did not gain control over the
upper Great Lakes until well after the [[War]] of [[1812]], a process begun in
Sault Ste Marie in [[1820]]. It should be noted that although the [[1820]] Sault

[[Treaty]] was with the [[United]] [[States]] [[government]], [[Native]] people who re

sided on the [[British]] side of the international border were instrumental in

the [[treaty]] process, notably the "[[British]] Chief, Shinwauk," who signed
the [[United]] [[States]] [[treaty]] with his English pseudonym, "[[August]]in Bart."
This [[1820]] [[Treaty]] did not put an end to the [[Native]] people's animosity
toward the [[American]]s, however, and they continued to harass [[American]]

surveyors until at least [[1825]].11 And, it should be noted, the [[British]]

continued to give presents to all [[Native]] people whose tribes supported
the [[British]] during the Revolutionary war and the [[War]] of [[1812]], an action
condemned by the [[American]]s as they too gave presents to all area
[[Native]] people without ascertaining whether they lived on purported Ca
nadian or [[American]] soil.12 In fact, residency in the Upper Saint Mary's
River area (near Sault Ste Marie) was made even more problematic by
the inability of the [[United]] [[States]] and Great [[Britain]] to agree on the
border through the area.13

During this entire period the [[Native]] people of the area continued to
adhere to the pre-war precept of ceding land only through consensus, as
scrutiny of the signatories to the land cession [[treaties]] confirms. Major
land cession [[treaties]] were signed by a very large number of representa
tives from virtually all area tribes. And [[treaties]] of importance to the
Anishnabeg of the Lake [[Huron]] borderlands were also signed by at least
fifty [[Native]] leaders from both sides of the international border.14 This
supra-national approach to [[treaty]] signing only bolsters the argument that

the area's [[Native]] people were acting in a manner befitting sovereign

people.

Yet despite the obvious solidarity, the power of the [[American]] govern

ment was growing and the support (and presents) given to the area's
[[Native]] people by the [[British]] diminished in proportion. By the early
[[1830]]s it was evident to both [[United]] [[States]] and [[British]] authorities that

the military power of the Anishnabeg was no longer a threat. In other

words, the [[British]] recognized that [[American]] power in the region had
grown to such a point that even a combined [[Native]]/[[British]] force was no
longer a match for the [[American]]s. It is at this point that the [[British]]
began a slow retreat from policies that were objectionable to the Ameri

cans, and the [[American]]s began to impose on the Anishnabeg the re
moval policies that were enacted in [[1830]].
As settlers from the east continued rushing into the upper Great Lakes,
the lives of the [[Native]] people?based on hunting, fishing, trapping, and
gathering?became severely disrupted. The pressure to cede land rose in
the same proportion. It was [[President]] Monroe (in [[1825]]) who suggested

that the [[Native]] people of the upper Great Lakes be removed to lands
west of the Mississippi to "shield them from impending doom [and]
promote their [[welfare]] and happiness."15 The first part of this statement
was certainly quite evident to the area's [[indigenous]] population, although
the second part was, no doubt, met with increasing skepticism.

Due to geography and [[history]], the Anishnabeg were not faced with
the choice of starvation or removal?they had a third option; moving to

the "[[British]]" side of the border. As we have already seen in the pattern
of [[treaty]] signings, the [[Native]] people of the area viewed the border as an
issue between the [[American]]s and the [[British]]; the border itself was of no
concern to them. Mass movement of [[Native]] peoples to areas north of the

border was scarcely new. Even before the Revolution, [[Native]] people
from the Northeast fled to the protection of the authorities north of what
were the original thirteen colonies.16 Following the Revolutionary [[War]],

the [[Mohawk]] leader Joseph Brant led a sizable portion of his Iroquois
people to a large reserve on both sides of the Grand River in southern
[[Ontario]]. Many other tribal groups left for [[Canada]] as well, including
some Ojibway, [[Ottawa]], Potawatomi, Munsee, Delaware (Lenni Lenap?),
and Wyandot peoples from the Great Lakes area.17
Part of the impetus for moving to [[Canada]] was the changing [[British]]
policy of presents distribution after the [[American]] Revolution. The Brit
ish recognized two separate categories of "[[Indian]]s": those "resident" in
[[Canada]] and those who were "visiting" from the [[United]] [[States]]. As the
cost of supplying the "visiting [[Indian]]s" rose, the [[British]] began to en
courage these [[Native]] people to establish themselves in [[Canada]] perma
nently in order to continue receiving their "presents."18 It should be
noted that the distribution of presents was not one-sided; [[Native]] people
continued to supply the [[British]] with food and with furs. Still it is true
that [[Native]] people had become more and more dependent upon Euro
pean goods long before the Revolution.
By the [[1830]]s complex pushes and pulls affected the movement of
[[Native]] people throughout the Great Lakes?the push of [[United]] [[States]]
Removal policies and the pull of [[British]] "presents." As the [[United]] [[States]]
pressed its removal policy, the [[British]] in [[Canada]] adopted a less severe
policy of establishing model villages in areas where the [[Native]] people
lived, with the cost of establishing these villages paid for through sale of
lands ceded to the Crown.19 The result in [[Canada]] was not the wholesale

removal of [[Native]] people as was seen in the [[United]] [[States]], but the
[[Native]] people of [[Canada]] were nonetheless dispossessed of their land as

well.

So while in the [[United]] [[States]] we see a rather small number of large
reservations, [[Canada]] established a very large number of generally much
smaller reservations. Taking [[Ontario]] and Michigan as examples, we see
that [[Ontario]] has 134 small reserves while Michigan has 11 reservations.

There was one notable exception to this general policy in the Upper
Great Lakes. In [[1836]], the [[British]] authorities proposed movement to
Manitoulin Island in the north Georgian Bay as a kind of "[[Canadian]]

Oklahoma."20 The plan was abandoned as [[white]] settlers continued to
press for the farmlands of Manitoulin Island to be turned over to them.
The language of the 1862 land cession [[treaty]] tells the tale: "it has been
deemed expedient... to assign to the [[Indian]]s now upon the island cer
tain specified portions ... and to sell the other portions thereof fit for
cultivation to settlers."21

Back on the [[American]] side of the border, the settlers continued to
press for the removal of the Great Lakes Anishnabeg. One example
from Michigan is instructive in this regard. Before the Michigan Terri
tory could be considered for statehood, it understandably had to secure a

large cession of land from the [[Native]] people. The result of this land
grab was the [[1836]] [[Treaty]] of [[Washington]], through which area Anishnabeg
ceded what came to be the northwestern two-thirds of the Lower Penin

sula and the eastern third of the Upper Peninsula?a sizable portion of
the resulting State. This [[1836]] [[Treaty]] was not negotiated as a "removal"
[[treaty]] even though the [[1830]] Removal Act was still the law of the land
(quite literally).

As is the case of all [[treaties]], after they are negotiated, the [[United]]
[[States]] Senate must ratify them. The Senate strongly supported removal,
so they amended the [[treaty]] to allow for occupancy of the reservations
set aside by the [[treaty]] to be only for a period of five years "unless the
[[United]] [[States]] shall grant them permission to remain on said lands for a
longer period."22 The amended [[treaty]] further stipulated that at any time

during that five-year period "as soon as the said [[Indian]]s desire it, a
deputation shall be sent to the southwest of the Missouri River, there to
select a suitable place for the final settlement of said [[Indian]]s.. .. When
the [[Indian]]s wish it, the [[United]] [[States]] shall remove them."23

The Anishnabeg of this [[1836]] [[treaty]] area were outraged that their
[[treaty]] had been so amended without their consultation or agreement, but
it passed the Senate with the amendments intact, and thus became (as is
true of all [[treaties]]) the Supreme Law of the Land. But the Anishnabeg

recognized several ways to resist removal within the context of the
amended [[Treaty]] language. The first was the provision that allowed the

[[government]] to grant the [[Native]] people "permission to remain on said
lands for a longer period," permission which they immediately sought.

Other resistance centered around the two phrases "as soon as the said
[[Indian]]s desire it" and "when the [[Indian]]s wish it." Simply said, the
"[[Indian]]s" vowed to never "desire" to travel to Kansas to select their
"new homelands" nor did they ever "wish" to remove.

THE END OF REMOVAL AND THE [[1855]] TREATY

OF WASHINGTON

This is not to say that all [[Native]] people from Michigan successfully
resisted removal, but of the approximate 8,000 people who were "en
couraged" to move, only about 650 were actually removed to lands west
of the Mississippi (most of these were Potawatomi from southern Michi
gan).24 And so, due to Anishnabeg resistance, the [[government]] was con
tinually obliged to grant them permission to remain in Michigan for a
series of five-year periods. This resistance lasted until [[1855]], when a new
[[treaty]] with the area Anishnabeg was signed. This [[1855]] [[Treaty]] finally,
and formally, reversed the [[government]]'s removal policy. Instead, the
[[1855]] [[Treaty]] provided for "allotments," presaging the [[government]]'s [[1887]]
Dawes Act provisions which required individual [[Native]] people to select
a portion of reserve lands to be held as "private [[property]]" after a twenty

five year period. (The [[1855]] [[Treaty]] "gave" 80 acres to each head of
household, with smaller acreage for other tribal members, and the time
period was only ten years.25) As was true of removal, the Anishnabeg of

Michigan found yet another way to resist this land-grab?they simply
refused to select their parcels, or, when the [[government]] assigned them
to parcels, they refused to take possession.
Anishnabeg resistance to [[white]] attempts to dispossess them of their
land thus took several forms. The successful military resistance of Pontiac,
Little Turtle, Tecumseh, and others saw to it that the [[government]] could
not force the Anishnabeg from their lands; the illegal Removal policy

was also largely unsuccessful, as was the shameful allotment process.
Simple geography also played an important role in the Anishnabeg's
refusal to be dispossessed. [[Canada]] was (and is) a potent lure?many
[[Native]] people, resisting removal or military threat, simply went across
the border to live until the threat abated, then returned. The value of
their northern lands to settlers also played a role in their resistance. The

lands set aside for them west of the Mississippi were generally more
desirable than the lands they occupied in the Upper Midwest, so as time

passed, the [[government]] found that many of the lands to which they
hoped to remove [[Native]] people were already occupied by [[white]] set
tlers?hence the [[1855]] [[treaty]]. And so, the [[Native]] people remained.

MODERN TREATY RIGHTS
There is one last thing to be explored and that is a brief discussion of
[[treaties]] generally, and two Upper Great Lakes [[treaties]] specifically. The

[[United]] [[States]] Constitution recognized [[treaties]] as the Supreme Law of
the Land, and, in this context it is not often remembered that [[treaties]] are

international agreements signed between two sovereign nations. Thus,
the [[treaties]] signed by [[Native]] people and the [[United]] [[States]] or [[Canadian]]
[[government]]s cannot be viewed as simply how the more powerful settler
[[government]]s imposed their will on the hapless natives. The [[treaties]]
must?as both [[United]] [[States]] and [[Canadian]] courts have affirmed?be
viewed as documents that bind both parties to the provisions as they are
set out in the [[treaty]]. Put another way, while most everyone would agree
that these [[treaties]] set out the [[Native]] people's relationship to the land and
resources of the land, few recognize that these [[treaties]] also delineate the
settler [[government]]'s relationship to the land and restrictions to settler's
access to the resources now shared with the [[indigenous]] people.
Jay's [[Treaty]] thus recognized three distinct political actors in North

America?[[Canada]], the [[United]] [[States]], and the "[[Indian]]" [[Nations]]. As Na
tive people signed hundreds of other [[treaties]], international law recog
nizes each signer nation as a sovereign power. "Land cession" [[treaties]]
are agreements whereby both parties agree on how the land and its
resources are to be shared. This is, of course, the traditional way that
[[Native]] people viewed the land and its resources. Both [[United]] [[States]] and
[[Canadian]] Courts have ruled that as the politically weaker and numeri
cally smaller parties to the [[treaties]], the intent and understanding of the
[[Native]] signatories must take precedence over the often self-serving in
terpretation by the dominant settler [[government]]s. Over the years the

[[United]] [[States]] Supreme Court upheld virtually all [[United]] [[States]]/[[Native]]
[[treaties]] and have indeed recognized the rights of [[Native]] people to the
land and/or resources as set out in the [[treaties]]?and as [[Native]] people
themselves have demonstrated how their long-dead signatories viewed
them. The alternative, of course, is that the [[treaties]] are not valid legal
documents and the rights granted to the settler [[government]]s are there

fore equally invalid. That is, in the case of so-called land cession trea
ties, the land (and its resources) is still legally "[[Indian]] land" and the
settlers have no rights to be there?they are essentially squatters. The
new [[Canadian]] Constitution and Charter of Rights (as seen by [[Canadian]]
Supreme Court rulings) recognizes the equality of rights enshrined by

both [[aboriginal]] people and by the settler [[government]]s in [[treaties]] and
other agreements.
Many [[treaties]] in the Upper Great Lakes were signed by [[Native]] people
who represented all affected [[Native]] people, whether the [[treaty]] was ne
gotiated with the [[United]] [[States]] or [[Canadian]] [[government]], and whether
[[representative]]s lived on one side or the other of [[Canada]]'s border with

the [[United]] [[States]]. Three [[treaties]]?the [[1836]] [[Canadian]] and [[United]] [[States]]

[[treaties]] mentioned above, and the [[Canadian]] [[1850]] [[Huron]]-[[Robin]]son
[[Treaty]]?serve as illustrations. The [[1836]] [[Canadian]] [[Treaty]] created a terri
tory much like Oklahoma on Manitoulin Island; the [[1836]] [[United]] [[States]]
[[treaty]] was the land cession [[treaty]] which essentially allowed Michigan to

be admitted to the Union; and the [[Canadian]] [[1850]] [[treaty]] ceded a vast
tract of land in northern [[Ontario]]. The [[Native]] people who negotiated and
signed these [[treaties]] were chosen by the [[Native]] community with little
regard to whether or not these [[representative]]s were "[[Canadian]]" or "Ameri
can" [[Indian]]s?they simply chose the best people from their Nation.

One last comparison is instructive. The [[1836]] [[United]] [[States]]/[[Native]]
[[treaty]] established that "The [[Indian]]s stipulate for the right of hunting on

the lands ceded, with the other usual privileges of occupancy, until the
time the land is required for settlement."26 The [[1850]] [[Huron]]-[[Robin]]son
[[Treaty]] likewise established that the [[government]] "agrees ... to allow the

said chiefs and their tribes the full and free privilege to hunt over

the territory now ceded by them, and to fish in the waters

thereof... excepting such portions of the said territory as may from
time to time be sold or leased to individuals or [[companies]] of individuals
and occupied by them."27
The consequences are unmistakable. In both cases, vast tracts of the

ceded territories have never been "settled" by [[white]]s; they are now
designated as State or Federal forests (in the [[United]] [[States]]) or Crown
lands (in [[Canada]]). (It is true, however that timber and other resources

have been stripped from these lands, and in many cases the land re
verted back to the settler [[government]]s for failure to pay the [[property]]
taxes). Still, in both the [[United]] [[States]] and in [[Canada]], area [[Native]] people
have had their rights to the natural recourses of the land recognized by
the Courts, notably as they relate to fishing rights. While originally a
"fishing rights" case, a recent agreement between the [[United]] [[States]], the

State of Michigan, and five tribes organized in the [[1836]] [[Treaty]] area
recognizes not only their right to a share of the fish resources of the
[[Treaty]] waters, but a recognition of the Anishnabeg right to "hunt, fish,
and gather" in the ceded territory.28 A recent ([[September]] 2000) confer

ence held in Sault Ste Marie, [[Ontario]], organized by those tribes in the
[[Huron]]-[[Robin]]son [[Treaty]] area of northern [[Ontario]], was held to formulate
plans to and solidify support for using [[treaty]] rights to access the exten
sive natural resources of northern [[Ontario]].

The Anishnabeg people of the Upper Great Lakes were never de
feated militarily, nor were they passive victims of settler depredations.

They have engaged in active resistance to the usurpations of lawless
immigrant groups (and their "law-abiding" [[government]]s) for hundreds

of years. Their survival?and occupancy and use of their traditional
homelands?is a testament to their success. Their continued struggle to
retain their diminished land-base and to exercise their rights to the area's

natural resources is a celebration of their vitality and will to survive.
They may be divided by a border?a line on a map?and they may live
in relatively isolated communities throughout what was once their vast
homeland, but the Anishnabeg were never vanquished, never dispersed.
While it is true that it is a struggle to assert a sense of national unity in
the face of two stronger hegemonic powers, they survive with a strong
sense of unity and a persistent sense of being Anishnabeg despite centu
ries of assault by settler peoples. They refuse to be unmade.
