This text speaks of a change in strategy in this moment of resistance, calling 
to widen the scope of revolt. While the main audience is other native people, 
the author urges settlers to read it and take away the main lessons as well.[1]

this in the hands of as many native folks as possible.
 
RECONCILIATION IS DEAD
 
Reconciliation is dead. It’s been dead for some time.
 
If only one thing has brought me joy in the last few weeks, it began when the 
matriarchs at Unist’ot’en burned the [[Canadian]] flag and declared reconciliation 
dead. Like wildfire, it swept through the hearts of youth across the 
territories. Out of their mouths, with teeth bared, they echoed back: 
reconciliation is dead! reconciliation is dead! Their eyes are more keen to the 
truth so many of our older generation have been too timid to name. The [[[[Trudeau]]]] 
era of reconciliation has been a farce from the beginning. It has been more for 
settler [[Canadian]]s than natives all along.
 
“Reconciliation is dead” is a [[battle]] cry.
 
It means the pressure to live up to our side of the bargain is over. The younger
generation have dropped the shackles to the ground. Perhaps we are moving into a
new time, one where militancy takes the place of negotiation and legal 
challenge. A time where we start caring less about what the colonizer’s legal 
and moral judgement and more about our responsibilities.
 
Criticizing reconciliation is not about shaming those elders and people who 
participated in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, it’s about attacking a 
[[government]] that used that moment of vulnerability to bolster it’s global image. 
I have said it before and I’ll say it again, I do not blame our older generation
for being hopeful about a more peaceful future. Those who lived through the 
horror of residential schools and the 60s scoop and the road allowance days and 
the sled dog slaughters could only have wanted a better life for the coming 
generations. It is the responsibility of those younger generations to stand up 
and say that what is being offered is not good enough. It is up to us to say 
that we would rather another hundred years of struggle than to accept the gentle
assimilation being offered. It is up to us to give thanks to our elders for 
their service and then to turn to the frontlines with our feathers and drums and
fists.
 
Because ideas on their own don’t make change. That is a liberal lie. It takes 
action behind words to make a difference. That action needs to be undertaken 
together. Neither ideas or practice are created by individuals. Everything 
written here is the result of discussion and interaction with other land 
defenders, lovers, anarchists, mothers, [[child]]ren, and resistors. We need to be 
accountable to the things we say while also recognizing that knowledge is 
created by communities. It has to always be seen that way in order to subvert 
hierarchy, to never allow one person to be elevated over any other.
 
So what is written here is all of yours. Take it and do with it as you please.
Argue it. Defend it. Decry it. Make it your own.
 
Forget the rules.
 
[[Canada]] is a colonial state. It exists to govern territory and manage the 
resources of that territory. It is nothing less and nothing more. It has done an
excellent job convincing its citizens that it stands for something, something 
good. This is the way it maintains its legitimacy. The national myth of 
politeness and civility wins the support of its constituents. This has been 
carefully constructed over time and it can be deconstructed. In fact, the rules 
of [[Canada]] change all the time. I would write more about this but the truth is I 
could not do a better job than something I recently came across online. 
@Pow_pow_pow_power recently wrote the following:
 
  Settler [[government]]s have been making up the rules as they go from the 
  beginning of their invasions. While each generation of us struggles to educate
  ourselves to the rulebook, they disregard it and do what they want when they 
  want. This should not be a surprise. It has always been this way because they 
  prioritize themselves about all – above other people, above animal relatives, 
  above the balance of Nature, and certainly above “what is right”. Laws have 
  always been passed to legitimize their whims and interests as the intentions 
  of seemingly rational rulers, and to keep us in compliance with their needs.
 
  We currently live in a time where our Imperialist structures have been deeply 
  concerned with appearing ordered and civilized to fellow regimes of power to 
  cultivate a sense of superiority. This is why the [[violence]] we have become 
  accustomed to is no longer mass slaughters and public torture and exiles but 
  night raids and disappearances, criminalizations and being locked into systems
  of neglect. It has become more reliant on structural [[violence]] & erasure than 
  direct [[violence]], and therefore more insidious. Insidiousness is more tidily 
  effective and harder to pinpoint as a source of injustice.
 
  This is why when we approach them, lawful and peaceful and rational and fair 
  minded and smooth toned, as gracious and calm as can be, we are easily 
  dismissed with polite [[white]] smiles of “best intentions” “deepest regrets” and 
  “we’re doing our best”, in fact “we’re doing better than most”. And when we 
  insist, more firmly, more impassioned, more justified, the response from 
  Settler Governments is as clear as we see now: “Why can’t you people just 
  obey?”
 
[[Canadian]]s want to believe that colonial [[violence]] is a thing of the past, so the 
[[government]] hides it for them. That is why the RCMP doesn’t allow journalists to 
film them as they sick dogs on women defending their land. That is why they will
get away with it.
 
The time has come to stop looking for justice in settler law.
 
For [[Indigenous]] people in [[Canada]], it is impossible to avoid the [[violence]] 
inflicted on us by the state. When we raise our fist and strike back, it is 
always an act of self-defense. Always. Committing to non-[[violence]] or pacifism in
the face of a violent enemy is a dangerous thing to do. Yet, attempting to avoid
using [[violence]] until absolutely necessary is a noble principle. One which 
carries the most hope for a new future. But what does [[violence]] mean to the 
settler state?
 
They don’t consider it violent to storm into a territory with guns drawn and 
remove its rightful occupants. They don’t consider it violent to level 
mountaintops, or clearcut forests, or to suck oil out of the ground only to burn
it into the air. They don’t consider it violent to keep chickens and pigs and 
cows in tiny crates, never allowing them to see sunlight, using them like food 
machines.
 
But smash a window of a [[government]] office..
Well, that goes too far.
 
It is time we see their laws for what they are: imaginary and hypocritical. 
Settler laws exist to protect settlers. We are not settlers. We are Michif. We 
are Anishinaabek. We are Onkwehón:we. We are Nêhiyawak. We are Omàmiwininì. We 
are Inuit. We are Wet’suwet’en. So why are we still appealing to their laws for 
our legitimacy?
 
Time after time, communities spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on legal 
challenges to land rights. Chippewa of the Thames First Nation used money won in
a land claim to launch a legal challenge against [[Canada]] to say they were never 
properly consulted, nor did they consent to, the Line 9 pipeline through their 
territory. The Supreme Court ruled against them, saying that [[Indigenous]] peoples 
do not have the right to say no to industrial projects in their territories. 
Line 9 is still operational. The Wet’suwet’en won probably the most significant 
legal challenge in [[Canadian]] [[history]]. The Delgamuukw verdict saw the courts 
acknowledge that the We’suwet’en territory is unceded, that they hold title and 
legal jurisdiction, and yet look at how [[Canada]] honours that. Legal victories are
not the way we win our land and dignity. [[Canada]] cares as little about [[Canadian]] 
law as they do [[Indigenous]] law.
 
The same goes for the United Nations and their precious UNDRIP. We have seen 
that the state will adopt United Nations Declaration on [[Indigenous]] Peoples 
(UNDRIP) principles and interpret them to suit their needs. That document says 
that [[government]]s and [[companies]] need free, prior, and informed consent to engage 
in projects in their territories. BC adopted it and, yet, says that it does not 
mean they have to gain consent from the Wet’suwet’en. Consent will never 
actually mean the right to say no. And the UN has no way to enforce it.
 
The time has passed for legal challenge in their courts that does nothing but 
drain our resources and slow us down. I honour those relatives and ancestors who
attempted the peaceful resolution, who trusted in the good intentions of other 
humans. But the settlers have proven that the peaceful options they offered us 
are lies. Fool us once, shame on you.
 
This is not only about Unist’ot’en anymore.
 
This is about all of us. Any day now the RCMP could attempt to move in and evict
the rail blockade at Tyendinaga. I stand in solidarity with them as much as I do
with the Wet’suwet’en. This moment is not just about getting the [[government]] and 
their militarized goons to back down at Unist’ot’en and Gitdum’ten, it’s about 
getting them to loosen their grip around all of our necks. This moment is about 
proclaiming reconciliation dead and taking back our power.
 
This is not to say that we should forget about Unist’ot’en and abandon them when
they need us most. It is a proposal to widen our scope so that we don’t lose our
forward momentum if what happens out west doesn’t meet our wildest dreams. This 
is about crafting a stronger narrative.
 
This means that we should think before claiming that the Wet’suwet’en have the 
right to their land because it is unceded. Do we not all have a right to the 
land stolen from our ancestors? For land to be unceded it means that it has 
never been sold, surrendered, or lost through conquest. The Royal Proclamation 
of [[1763]] urged [[Canada]] and the dominion to only take land through the making of 
[[treaty]]. And so agents of [[Canada]] set out to do so. They continued to make 
[[treaties]] across the continent, sometimes lying about the content of the [[treaties]]
to ancestors who didn’t speak english, sometimes finding whoever the hell would 
sign the [[treaty]] without much concern for if that person was acting with the 
support of the community. After the signing of the last [[treaty]], [[Canada]] made it 
illegal for [[Indian]]s to hire lawyers to challenge land claims. And then they 
stole the rest of what they wanted. They continued to flood the land with 
settlers until native peoples had only 0.2% of the land they once protected and 
lived on.
 
I don’t care about appealing to the legitimacy of unceded territory. All land is
stolen land. [[Canada]] has no jurisdiction on any of it because they have broken 
any agreements they ever made in the process of taking it.
 
The same critique rings true for holding up hereditary governance as the only 
true leadership of [[Indigenous]] peoples. I am not advocating for band council. But
it is important to understand that many of our relations have lost the 
hereditary systems that once helped them live good lives. We are going to have 
to rekindle our governance. Some we can pull from the past, some we will have to
make anew. All freely chosen forms of [[Indigenous]] governance are legitimate. Our 
legitimacy does not flow from the mouths of our leaders, but from our connection
to the land and water and our commitment to our responsibilities to all life 
today and generations to come.
 
This is a good thing if we let it be. It is foolish to think we would not have 
changed and grown in 300 years. Our systems would look different today no matter
what. This is an opportunity to combine new and beautiful ideas with the 
time-honoured traditions and ceremonies of our ancestors, spiritual communities 
where hierarchy is subverted and gender is liberated!
 
It is time to shut everything the fuck down.
 
[[Canada]] has always been afraid of us standing in our power. Reconciliation was a 
distraction, a way for them to dangle a carrot infront of us and trick us into 
behaving. Now is the time to show them how clear our vision is. Being determined
and sure is not the same as being unafraid. There are many dangerous days ahead 
of us. It is dangerous to say, “I will not obey.”
 
The first thing we need to do is stop stabbing each other in the back. Take a 
seat on band council if you want, but stop letting it go to your head. Don’t 
ever see yourself as more than a servant, a cash distributor, a rule enforcer. 
Being elected is not the same as earning a place of respect in your community. 
It does not make you an elder. Let me take this time to say a giant “fuck you” 
to the Métis nations who sign pipeline agreements because they are so excited 
the [[government]] considered them [[Indigenous]]. The Métis have no land rights in 
[[Ontario]] and yet they continue to sign agreements as if they do, throwing the 
[[Indigenous]] nations with actual territory under the train. Let me extend that 
“fuck you” to the [[Indigenous]] nations who signed pipeline agreements and stand by
in silence as their relations are attacked for protecting the water. Or even 
worse when they do interviews with pro-oil lobby groups and conservative media 
decrying the land defenders in their midst. Can’t they see the way [[Canadian]]s eat
up their words, drooling over the division amongst us, using it to devalue our 
way of life? I do not condone attacking our relatives who have lost the red 
path, but we need to find a way to bring them back home. Not everybody has to 
take up a frontline in their community, but at the bare minimum they should 
refuse to cooperate with the colonial [[government]] and their corporate minions.
 
The second thing we need to do is act. But we do not have to limit ourselves to 
actions that demand the withdrawal of forces from Wet’suwet’en territory. The 
federal [[government]] is the one calling the shots, not just at Unist’ot’en but at 
every point of native oppression across all the territories. Any attack on the 
state of [[Canada]] is in solidarity. Any assertion of native [[sovereignty]] is in 
solidarity.
 
It’s time to start that occupation you’ve been dreaming up.
 
Is there a piece of land that has been annexed from your territory? Take it 
back. Is there a new pipeline being slated through your backyard? Blockade the 
path. Are their cottagers desecrating the lake near your community? Serve them 
an eviction notice and set up camp. Sabotage the fish farms [[kill]]ing the salmon. 
Tear down the dam interrupting the river. Play with fire.
 
When we put all of our hopes and dreams into one struggle in one spot, we set 
ourselves up for heartbreak and burnout. Let’s fight for the Wet’suwet’en 
people, yes! But let’s honour their courage and their actions by letting them 
inspire us to do the same. Let’s fight for them by fighting for the manoomin and
the wetlands and the grizzlies.
 
Choose your accomplices wisely. Liberals who read land acknowledgments often 
have too much invested in this system to actually see it change. Communists 
envision a system without a capitalist [[Canada]], but they still want a communist 
state. One that will inevitably need to control land and exploit it. Find common
heart with those who want to see the state destroyed, to have autonomous 
communities take its place, and to restore balance between humans and all our 
relations. Choose those who listen more than they talk, but not those who will 
do whatever you say and not think for themselves. They are motivated by guilt. 
Find those who have a fire burning in them for a more wild and just world. Most 
of them will be anarchists, but not all, and not all anarchists will come with a
good mind.
 
Creating a [[battle]]field with multiple fronts will divide their energies. The rail
blockades are working! If the night time rail sabotage and the copper wire and 
the blockades keep coming, it will shut down all rail traffic across this awful 
economy. More is better. But do it not just for the Wet’suwet’en, do it for the 
rivers and streams that weave themselves under the rails. Do it for the 
ancestors who saw the encroaching railroad as their coming demise.
 
And as a critique out of Montreal wrote: don’t settle for symbolic and 
intentional arrest.
 
When they come to enforce an injunction, move to another part of the rail.
 
When they come with a second injunction, block the biggest highway nearby.
 
When they come with a third injunction, move to the nearest port.
 
Stay free and fierce. The folks at Unist’ot’en and Gitdum’ten didn’t have the 
option to, but you do. Anticipate their next move and stay ahead of them.
 
This is a moment among many moments. Our ancestors have been clever, sometimes 
biding their time quietly, sometimes striking, always secretly passing on our 
ceremonies and stories. I honour them as I honour you now. We are still here 
because of them and our [[child]]ren and our [[child]]ren’s [[child]]ren will still be here 
because of us. Never forget who we are. Fight in ceremony.
 
I suppose this is a proposal for adopting a strategy of [[indigenous]] anarchism 
here on Turtle Island. A rejection of tactics that demand things from powerful 
people and a return to building for ourselves a multitude of local, diverse 
solutions. This is a rejection of Idle No More style organizing, let’s not 
repeat the mistakes of the past (for a detailed critique of INM, see https://war
riorpublications.wordpress.com/[[2012]]/12/12/idle-no-more-speak-for-yourself/[3] 
and while you’re there read everything else). It is a plea for us to choose our 
own leaders and create governance that refuses hierarchy. An ask for us to 
reject reconciliation and move towards a militant reclamation. The idea of 
[[indigenous]] anarchism is still in its infancy. Write me about it.
 
This is one of our moments. Let’s make it not about demanding for them to leave 
Unist’ot’en alone, but about demanding that they leave the land alone. Don’t 
make it about stopping CGL from making money, make it about denouncing the idea 
of money. This is about colonization everywhere. This is about all of us.
 
To the settlers inevitably reading this zine.
 
What is written here is meant for you too. Not in the “rise up and take back 
your land” kind of way. Been there, done that.
 
But I have been reading the messaging on the reportbacks and in the media and I 
see you falling into all sorts of tired traps. You are not just cogs in the 
solidarity machine, you too can take up struggles in the cities you live. 
Remember the Two Row: you can fight parallel [[battle]]s towards the same goals.
 
I have heard many an elder say that we will not win this fight on our own, and 
that is most certainly true. Thank you for the ways you have attacked the 
economy and the state. Thank you for answering the call. Now take this and run 
with it.
 
You too should look for ways to defend the land and water in the places you 
live. You too should look for ways to undermine and weaken the power of the 
[[government]] over these lands. Don’t let yourself be disheartened if the RCMP 
don’t leave Unist’ot’en. That is only one fight of many. That is only the 
beginning. Don’t fall into the traps of appealing to [[Canadian]] or international 
law.
 
See yourself for what you are, for who your community is. Act in ways that bring
about a world where reconciliation is possible, a world in which your people 
give back land and dismantle the centralized state of [[Canada]]. Don’t romanticize 
the native peoples you work with. Don’t feel that you can’t ever question their 
judgment or choose to work with some over others. Find those that have kept the 
fire alive in their hearts, those who would rather keep fighting than accept the
reconciliation carrot. Don’t ever act from guilt and shame.
 
And don’t let yourself believe that you can transcend your settlerism by doing 
solidarity work. Understand that you can, and should, find your own ways to 
connect to this land. From your own tradition, inherited or created.
 
Print this zine and distribute it to your [[Indigenous]] comrades.[2]
 
Take risk. Dream big. Pursue anarchy. Stay humble.
