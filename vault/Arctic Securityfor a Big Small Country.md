[[Arctic]] Security for a Big Small Country
Tony Penikett

11.1. Introduction
What does ‘[[Arctic]] security’ mean for a nation state with lots of geography,
but not many people? To be sure, superpowers still rule the world or
dream of doing so. Throughout the Cold [[War]], the ‘old’ superpowers,
[[Russia]] and the [[United]] [[States]], scoped the great [[white]] spaces of [[Arctic]]
lands and waters as potential [[battle]]grounds. Near the end of the Cold
[[War]], on 1 [[October]] [[1987]] at Murmansk, Mikhail Gorbachev proposed that
the [[Arctic]] become a ‘zone of peace’ and a new theatre of cooperation, but
we are not there yet.1 The old superpowers still aim enough [[nuclear]]
weapons at each other to incinerate the planet at the press of a button.
And the 21st century now catches the ascendant powers: [[China]], India and
others casting covetous eyes over the [[Arctic]]’s lands, resources and waters.
So, how might an [[Arctic]] nation with bountiful natural wealth but
limited human resources respond not just to the challenges of [[climate]]
change, cyber [[warfare]] and globalisation but also considerable threats
to its economic, social and environ[[mental]] security from distant powers?
One answer might be a ‘bottom up’, ‘[[North]] First’ or communitarian
approach to security.

11.2. Old Crow
In Hunting the [[North]]ern Character, I wrote about a memorable [[2006]] conversation I had with a [[Canadian]] Senator. The Senator had travelled from
[[Ottawa]] to visit Old Crow, the home of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation
(People of the Lakes), the northernmost First Nation in [[Canada]]’s [[Yukon]]

Territory. In a word, the Senator was astonished by what he saw. Rather
than the [[poverty]], poor housing and dysfunction evident on many ‘[[Indian]]
reserves’ in southern [[Canada]], he witnessed in Old Crow a bustling,
prospering community, with new houses under construction and new
jobs in the regional airline in which the Vuntut Gwitchin were now
part owners.
The source of the economic and social [[health]] in this community
resulted from its land claims [[treaty]] negotiated with the federal and
territorial [[government]]s and signed in [[1993]], which returned 7,744 square
kilometres of land to Vuntut Gwitchin ownership and CA$19.2 million
‘compensation’, much of it held in trust for future generations.2
Gazing upon the community’s new houses and airline jobs, the
Senator wondered aloud how [[Canada]] could justify that expenditure.
Think of it as an investment, I responded. Look west to [[Alaska]]. The US
has something like 20,000 armed forces in the state. At that time, [[Canada]]
had but two soldiers based in the territory. The Vuntut Gwitchin [[Treaty]]
and the viable community it [[foster]]ed, I argued, represented a substantial
investment in [[Canada]]’s [[Arctic]] [[sovereignty]] and security. At that point,
I had not heard public policy articulated exactly that way, but validation
of my view came in a [[2015]] EKOS [[Research]] Associates survey finding that
78 per cent of respondents in the [[Canadian]] [[North]] and 69 per cent of
respondents in the [[Canadian]] [[South]] – 81 per cent and 71 per cent respectively in [[2010]] – thought that the ‘best way to protect [[[Canada]]’s] national
interests in the [[Arctic]] is to have [[[Canadian]]s] living there’.3

11.3. Difficult Choices
As every politician knows, governing means making choices between:
[[sovereignty]] and security; economic and social security; also, arms acquisitions and environ[[mental]] protection. Has [[Canada]] sometimes [[trade]]d away
some of its [[sovereignty]]? Historian Desmond Morton has written that,
by joining various [[alliance]]s, the country did exactly that.4 [[Canadian]]s
quickly air their anxieties about the country’s ‘[[sovereignty]]’, such as when,
in [[1969]], the oil tanker SS [[Manhattan]] sailed through the [[North]]west
Passage, which [[Canada]] sees as its ‘internal waters’, and the US regards as
‘international strait’. Although [[Canadian]] nationalists saw this as an act of
[[America]]n ‘imperialism’, [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]] did not go to war
over the issue. Rather, [[Ottawa]] and [[Washington]] simply agreed to disagree.
Regardless, in [[1970]], the federal [[government]] asserted [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]]
with the [[Arctic]] Waters Pollution Prevention Act.

After US Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea navigated the Passage
once more in [[1985]], [[Canada]] drew straight baselines around the [[Arctic]]
Archipelago, effectively redefining its [[Arctic]] boundaries. For all that, an
EKOS poll showed that one in four [[Canadian]]s imagined that the country
had military bases all along the [[North]]west Passage.5 During the Cold
[[War]], only [[America]]n and [[Russia]]n submarines actually cruised through
[[Canada]]’s ‘internal waters’.
More so, can any ‘middle power’ afford both a mighty military
machine and a [[government]]-funded [[health]] care system? The [[United]]
[[States]] remains the most heavily armed nation in the world. By contrast,
[[Canada]]’s single-payer [[health]] care system is its most expensive and
popular social programme. [[Canada]]’s [[health]]care system was estimated
to cost CA$253.5 billion in [[2018]]; the country spends one tenth of that
on defence.6
In truth, the eight [[Arctic]] states all face tough choices about security
expenditures. [[Canadian]]s and [[America]]ns agree on the urgent need for
[[Arctic]] Ocean ports and new icebreakers, but neither Parliament nor
[[Congress]] have proved ready to appropriate the necessary sums. A single
icebreaker may cost over US$1 billion, and southern politicians will
always have other priorities.

11.4. Different Perspectives on Security
[[North]]erners have long been aware that ‘security’ may mean different things
to different folk. At a US and [[Canada]] Military Law Training session at a
Seattle Coast Guard base, in [[September]] [[2015]], I suggested that, for the
[[Canadian]] [[Arctic]], three broadly different perspectives colour security debates
among [[parliament]]arians, political scientists and [[North]]ern thinkers.

For conservatives, security must be bought with armaments and
military infrastructure. Armed might increases a nation’s command
and control of its territory. Rob Huebert, an articulate exponent
of this view, writes: ‘Within [[Canada]], [[Arctic]] [[sovereignty]] can be
understood in the context of the [[Canadian]] [[government]]’s ability
to control what happens in the area that it defines as its [[Arctic]]
region.’7 However, as every caribou hunter and [[Arctic]] mariner
knows, control is an illusion. No matter how massive a country’s
military spending, that cannot stop [[climate]] change or prevent
extreme weather events. Besides, [[Arctic]] security means much more
than [[Arctic]] [[sovereignty]].8

To protect against external threats, about half of [[Canadian]]s
do agree that their country must build a more muscular military
presence in the [[Arctic]].9 At the same time, everybody knows that
fighter jets screaming over the tundra or warships calling at all the
world’s ports, but never to the non-existent ports of [[Arctic]] [[North]]
[[America]], do not make northerners feel secure. Another uncomfortable truth for [[Canada]] is that, for decades, both conservative
and liberal [[government]]s loudly announced military procurement
decisions, then followed with missed deadlines, endless delays and
quiet cancellations.
Former Liberal foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy promoted a concept
called ‘human security’. For liberals, ‘human security’ means, among
other things, food, housing and individual human rights. Indeed,
[[Canadian]] public opinion [[research]] showed that citizens saw threats
to [[Arctic]] security coming not from [[missile]]s or [[bomb]]ers, but [[climate]]
change, environ[[mental]] degradation and extreme [[poverty]].10 In an
address to the [[United]] Nations, Axworthy argued: ‘… security should
be measured in terms of ultimate outcome for individuals and
peoples…’11
One problem with the liberal idea is that it focuses on the
individual, who may not be a good reference point for [[Arctic]]
security. For Hollywood, the lone man with a gun represents the
iconic figure of the [[Western]] frontier, but in Jack London’s ‘To Build
a Fire’, the Cheechako walking down the [[Yukon]] River at fifty
degrees below zero – without a companion – freezes to [[death]].
Perhaps neither the state nor the individual stand as a referent point
for [[Arctic]] security.
As Franklyn Griffiths, [[Canada]]’s pre-eminent [[Arctic]] scholar,
explains:
‘I suggest we take the referent object for life and quality of
life in the [[Arctic]] to be neither the state, nor the individual, nor
civil society, but the community, typically the remote small
[[indigenous]] community which is embedded in the natural
environment. Characterising the referent object, the term
“community” also sums up the many and varied purposes of
collective action for the good in [[Arctic]] conditions. It connotes
order without law. This is order that’s based on shared norms
or standards of behaviour that govern human relations and,
especially in an [[Arctic]] setting, human relations with the world
of nature.’12

From this kind of ‘social democrat’ perspective, security starts with
viable cooperative communities as the [[corn]]erstone. As Gorbachev
declared on 1 [[October]] [[1987]]: ‘The community and interrelationship
of the interests of our entire world is felt in the northern part of
the globe, in the [[Arctic]], perhaps more than anywhere else.’13
A former conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, used to
say of the [[Arctic]] that [[Canada]] must ‘use it or lose it’, but in the
Far [[North]], there exist enduring human communities that have
been ‘using it’ since time immemorial. Indeed, the greatest threat
of [[Canada]] ‘losing’ its [[Arctic]] might arise not from hostile [[nuclear]]
submarines or long-range [[bomb]]ers, but from the social, climatic
and economic challenges that keep those living there from fully
benefiting from [[Canadian]] citizenship.14
Securing the world’s emerging [[Arctic]] ‘community of
communities’ might sound like an idealist’s dream, but survey
[[research]] suggests that building towards such a goal would appeal
not only to [[Canadian]]s, but to other [[Arctic]] residents as well.15
By itself, the [[Canadian]] military could not defeat the army of any
major power. Taking a multidimensional approach to securing the
[[Canadian]] [[Arctic]] and the wider [[Arctic]] community is more realistic
than making empty promises of military expansion, which offer
only fantasies of command and control.

Harking back to the conversation with the Senator in Old Crow,
[[treaty]] negotiations have contributed mightily to [[Arctic]] [[sovereignty]]
and security in both [[Canada]] and the [[United]] [[States]]. Following the
[[Alaska]] [[Native]] Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of [[1971]], [[indigenous]]
[[Alaska]] communities collectively recaptured 180,000 square kilometres
of [[Alaska]] lands, making them the largest private landowners in the
state, and almost US$1 billion in compensation. Following ANCSA,
[[Canada]] chose to negotiate 20 [[treaties]] with northern [[indigenous]]
peoples. For [[indigenous]] people, these [[treaty]] lands and self-[[government]]
agreements represented redress for a century of colonisation. For
[[Canada]], these [[treaties]] stand as enduring expressions of the nation
state’s [[sovereignty]] and security. Of necessity, given the political complexities of our time, a successful [[Arctic]] security strategy would combine
elements of all three perspectives described above.

11.5. Securing the [[Arctic]] Community
At the [[North]] [[America]]n [[Arctic]] Maritime and Environ[[mental]] Security
Workshop in Anchorage in [[September]] [[2018]], I suggested that a strategic
security architecture for a big country with a small population then might
need four dimensions: a deep conception of security; wide cooperation
around the [[Arctic]] region; longitudinal, two-way collaboration between
[[Arctic]] villages, regional and national [[government]]s, and international
entities such as the [[Arctic]] Council, International Maritime Organization
(IMO Polar Code), [[NATO]], NORAD, SAR [[treaty]] and the [[United]] Nation
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS); plus investment over time
in civilian and military infrastructure.
a.

b.

Deep Conception of Security: A deep conception of ‘security’ would
encompass everything from military to individual to community
security, including, of course, economic, social and environ[[mental]]
aspects. Without potable water, individuals suffer. Without food
security, a community suffers. Without habitable dwellings, [[Arctic]]
residents shiver in the dark. Without income security, [[homeless]]
northerners bed down beneath ATMs. Absent [[climate]] change
mitigation, the whole world suffers. Food, water, housing, environ[[mental]], economic and social security all matter, especially in the
[[Arctic]]. In their survey sample drawn from the [[Canadian]] [[North]],
EKOS found that, when asked to rate five different aspects of [[Arctic]]
security, nine in 10 respondents identified environ[[mental]] and
social security as being the most important; two thirds regarded
economic security and cultural and language security as such;
while 45 per cent placed importance on national security.16 This
illustrated that to many [[Canadian]]s, particularly those in the [[North]],
the conception of security includes domestic factors (cultural,
social and environ[[mental]] security) in addition to national security.17
Wide Cooperation: On-the-ground cooperation among villages, cities
and regions, also nation-states, is also a funda[[mental]] requirement
for [[Arctic]] security. Norwegian scholar Andreas Østhagen notes that
the [[Europe]]an Union has responded to [[Washington]]’s demands for
increased [[EU]] defence spending by improving regional cooperation,
pooling of resources and the sharing of talent. Østhagen thinks that
collaboration and cooperation may be a financial necessity, even for
superpowers.18 Even now, long after the Cold [[War]], Swedish diplomat
and security expert Rolf Ekéus thinks we cannot achieve security
in the [[Arctic]] without the cooperation of both [[Russia]] and the

[[United]] [[States]], which at the Bering Strait are separated by very few
kilometres.19 In any case, today’s threats to [[Arctic]] security are
economic and environ[[mental]], and more civilian than military.
Longitudinal Coordination: Longitudinal coordination between
communities, regions and nations counts as a vital third dimension.
Achieving [[Arctic]] scale security depends on effective, longitudinal
coordination between chiefs or [[government]]s of communities,
legislators of sub-national entities, federal [[government]]s or nationstates, and international bodies like the [[Arctic]] Council, the IMO
and UNCLOS. Such coordination can be achieved only through
two-way communication, not top-down, south-to-north diktats
from national capitals. It will also require functioning relationships
at every level, including with the private and not-for-profit sectors.
Securing the [[Arctic]] will also require multi-party coordination
at all levels, from community to region to nation, as well as long-term
infrastructure investment plans, such as the most successful private
operators make. In the polar regions, coordination and communication between the public and the private sectors is critical. Sometimes,
as in the following example, it can be a matter of life and [[death]].

50 [[research]]ers working at the Amundsen Scott–[[South]] Pole

[[Research]] Station, suffered a potentially life-threatening gall bladder
attack. To retrieve the 59-year-old doctor, an eight-seat Twin Otter
plane fitted with skis for landing gear flew from the Rothera
[[Research]] Station on the Ant[[arctic]] Peninsula, the first successful
evacuation at the [[South]] Pole during the cold and dark polar
winter. Kenn Borek Air, a [[Canadian]] [[company]] led the mid-winter
rescue flight.
Investment over time: Beyond isolation, many [[Arctic]] communities
suffer both economic distress and environ[[mental]] damage, as well as
food, [[health]] and housing deficits. Security for such communities
may only be achieved with long-term investments in airports,
ports, roads, schools and other such multiple-use infrastructure.
The sustainability of any such investment plan will need firm
commitments from chiefs, mayors, legislators, governors and
federal officials towards building the necessary consensus on
infrastructure investments. Given [[Canada]]’s sorry [[history]] of military
procurements, common sense might suggest forging all-party,
long-term plans for multi-use (civilian, corporate and military)
infrastructure in the [[Arctic]] for the nation.

The best demonstration of [[Canadian]] [[sovereignty]] would be to ensure that
residents of our [[North]] are able to continue living in their communities.
As the EKOS study showed, some respondents, noting the high costs and
lack of access to services in the [[North]], argued that ‘the remoteness of
northern communities should not result in inferior services and quality
of life compared to that enjoyed by other [[Canadian]]s. In the words of one
focus group participant, “We pay taxes just like everybody else”.’20 By
fighting housing shortages, low educational attainment and drug and
alcohol abuse, [[Canada]]’s [[Arctic]] [[sovereignty]] can be greatly strengthened.
We can reinforce our national relationships with the [[Arctic]] by investing
in the region’s economic and social foundations, by fully implementing
nation-building land-claim settlements with [[indigenous]] peoples and
by investing in military hardware and multi-use infrastructure. The
[[Canadian]] Department of National Defence (DND)’s Defence [[Science]]
Advisory Board (DSAB) Report 1001 actually recommended a ‘northern
first’ policy for procurement for [[Arctic]] operations (building multipurpose infrastructure for military operations, resource developers and
communities).21
The ‘[[North]] First’ approach of the Defence [[Science]] Advisory Board
makes a lot of sense, especially if, together, the federal parties in
Parliament, after consulting with [[indigenous]] communities and territorial

[[government]]s, could be persuaded to adopt a long-term plan to build
multi-purpose infrastructure, ports and runways, and to base icebreakers
and rescue aircraft in the [[North]]. On the [[corn]]erstone of community,
[[Canada]] could build [[Arctic]] security using the tools of cooperation,
coordination and long-term investment.

11.6. Conclusion: A Security Framework
To sum up, a security framework for a big country with a small population
would be founded on a deep definition of security; wide cooperation
between villages, towns and regions; longitudinal (two-way) coordination
between villages, cities, states and territories, nations and international
entities; and long-term investments in multi-use infrastructure.
To be clear, [[Canada]]’s [[Arctic]] [[sovereignty]] and security could be
compromised by our [[Arctic]] citizens not having access to clean drinking
water, second-rate schools, low or melting ice cover and permafrost that
upset communities and disrupt the migratory patterns of the fish and
game on which northerners rely. And it can be undermined by high
unemployment rates that force many young northerners to move south
to find work. Poverty is an obvious source of insecurity.
During his last [[Arctic]] tour, Conservative Prime Minister Stephen
Harper described his [[Arctic]] mission as nation-building. ‘This is the
frontier. This is the place that defines our country’, he said.22 ‘Our country

is widely recognised as one that broadly defines its security by seeking to
promote environ[[mental]], cultural and food security at home in [[Canada]]
and throughout the world. This commitment should hold true in every
part of the country – from sea to sea to sea.’23 The latter commitment
most [[Canadian]]s might well embrace. But as Thomas Berger famously
pointed out in [[North]]ern Frontier, [[North]]ern Homeland, the report of his
Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry, ‘The [[North]] is a frontier, but it is a
homeland too.’24
