[image 1: streets-of-papunya (link #1)]Having thoroughly enjoyed Vivien 
Johnson’s previous book, Once Upon a Time in Papunya[2], her attempt to 
chronicle the rise of Papunya Tula Artists, I didn’t really think twice when 
Rosina Di Marzo of New South Books reached out to ask if I would be interested 
in reviewing Johnson’s newest publication, Streets of Papunya: the re-invention 
of Papunya painting. A few weeks late the handsome volume appeared in my 
mailbox, and I settled in to read.
 
Johnson’s allegiance to the town of Papunya itself has not wavered over four 
decades since she and her husband at the time, the artist Tim Johnson, trekked 
out to the settlement to investigate the new art movement that was taking shape 
there. And although the town donated its name to the longest-lived and most 
prosperous [[Aboriginal]] art company to date, the force of the movement went west, 
“Kintorelakatu,” as the [[War]]umpi Band sang it, in the great exodus of the Pintupi
to their homelands, first at Kintore, or Walungurru, and later even farther west
at Kiwirrkura, where the movement and the company continue to flourish to this 
day.
 
In recent years, with the flourishing of the desert art movement again in the 
central and southern reaches, Papunya’s name has come into common parlance in a 
new way, associated now with Papunya Tjupi, a new company that remains firmly 
rooted in the Honey Ant, or Tjupi, Dreaming. In her new book, Johnson sets out 
to chronicle art in the town of Papunya from the early day soy the [[1950]]s up to 
the present, and in doing so she has woven a story that fills in many blanks and
provides much-needed continuity. She has also, for me, told a tale that evoked 
many partly forgotten memories of my own earliest explorations of the art of the
desert.
 
The literal streets of Papunya have long held a fascination for me, ever since I
first saw an aerial view of the town that displayed an uncanny resemblance to a 
traditional sand drawing of four people seated around a campsite. It took a 
while to track down the origin of this striking design[3] as documented in the 
Rev. J. H. Downing’s [[Aboriginal]] ‘Dreamings’ and Town Plans: a report on 
traditional [[Aboriginal]] camp layout in relation to town planning (Institute for 
[[Aboriginal]] Development, [[1979]]).

The conscious decision to pattern the settlement’s growth on the honey-ant 
designs has found new expression in recent times. The legacy of the founders of 
the Papunya art movement (as distinct, in some cases, from the founders of 
Papunya Tula) now lives on in the streets of Papunya, which bear names like 
[[War]]ungkula Court and Possum Crescent. In a new access of pride in their [[history]],
the residents of Papunya, many of whom are direct descendants of the old men who
initiated the painting movement and became it earliest household names, have 
rememorialized the families that are the backbone of tradition in the community.
 
Johnson’s [[history]] begins in the [[1950]]s, an early chapter being the story of 
Albert Namatjira’s six months of court-ordered house arrest after his conviction
for supplying alcohol to a “ward of the state.” The presence of the most famous 
[[Aboriginal]] artist of all time in the town seems to have ignited a keener 
interest in the production of art, although the majority of the earliest 
attempts were either watercolors in the style of the master, or wood carvings 
that, despite their complexity and beauty, could easily be hawked to the tourist
[[trade]].
 
By the time of Geoffrey Bardon’s storied arrival, then, several of the names 
that now adorn the streets of Papunya were already in circulation as artists, 
names that became the first rank of superstars: Kaapa Mbitjana, Johnny 
[[War]]ungkula, Clifford Possum, Michael Nelson Jagamara. These men, along with 
others like Long Jack Phillipus, Limpi Putungka Tjanpangati, Don Tjungurrayi, 
and Two Bob Tjungurrayi, were to become the Papunya artists: they painted early 
on for Papunya Tula, but they also remained behind when the Pintupi left to 
invent new pictorial traditions and sustain the Dreamings of Papunya.
 
[image 3: strets-of-papunya-limpi (link #5)]The story of Papunya painting in the
80s and 90s as Johnson tells it is for me the emotional center of Streets of 
Papunya, although I must say up front that that is a most personal judgment, 
reflective of my own [[history]] far more than Johnson’s. The first Papunya painting
that I owned was a brilliant Water Dreaming by Long Jack Phillipus. The most 
startling early Papunya board I’ve ever fallen in love with is a Crow and Yam 
Dreaming by Limpi (at right), an artist I had never heard of until I saw the 
work reproduced in an auction catalog. For some reason I could never recapture, 
I was fascinated by the work of Two Bob Tjungurrayi; now having read Johnson’s 
book I understand that the brilliance of [[Turkey]] Tolson’s Straightening Spears 
paintings owes a great deal to stylistic innovations that Limpi and Two Bob 
undertook in the late 80s, before [[Turkey]] and his fellow innovator, Mick 
Namarari, themselves left the streets of Papunya behind. Reading about the 
heyday of [[War]]umpi Arts, then located on Gregory Terrace around the corner from 
the old Papunya Tula shop, made me remember how thrilling it was in those days 
to be discovering the genius of the art of the central desert.
 
Many of the artists who catapulted Papunya Tula to fame remained in Papunya 
after the Pintupi exodus, and considerable artistic innovation was happening 
there. Limpi Putungka and Two Bob Tjnugurrayi introduced a tile of dotting 
backgrounds in stripes of alternating and contrasting colors, adumbrating the 
Straightening Spears motif that would make [[Turkey]] Tolson internationally 
renowned. [[Turkey]] and Mick Namarari themselves stayed close to Papunya for years 
after the settlement of Kintore. [[War]]umpi Arts was providing a successful 
commercial outlet in Alice Springs for the likes of Long Jack Phillipus, Dinny 
Nolan, and Dini Campbell. But art making in Papunya remained a precarious 
business without the support of a local art centre.
 
As many of the old men [[died]] or grew too frail to paint extensively without 
support (Johnny [[War]]ungkula was nearly blind), wives and daughters became more 
central to the continuing painting tradition in the tiny settlement town. 
Appeals for [[government]] support stalled in Canberra’s bureaucracy or went unheard
at all. But the artists (and Johnson) persisted in their efforts to pass on the 
stories in the new format of acrylic paint.
 
Finally in the mid-noughts, the developing talents of the women painters and the
persistence of friends and supporters began to bear fruit. A disused mechanic’s 
garage and an empty schoolteacher’s apartment were turned over to the use of a 
fledgling art centre and its coordinators. But even then, obstacles remained: 
for example, although the garage was fitted up with utilities and plumbing that 
allowed work to take place there and be stored safely, it proved impractical to 
subdivide the building in order to provide culturally appropriate separate 
spaces for men and women to work in. This simple fact helps to explain why even 
today the output of Papunya Tjupi, as the new centre came to be known, features 
primarily the work of women artists: the men have had a hard time finding the 
proper support to develop their talents.
 
The women, however, have become a force to be reckoned with in the 21st century 
wave of desert painting, developing a style that recognizably belongs to Papunya
Tjupi, but at the same time constantly developing new idioms and [[experiment]]ing 
with new compositional strategies. Doris [[Bush]] Nungurrayi, Candy Nelson 
Nakamarrra, Isobel Gorey Nambajimba, Narlie Nelson Nakamarra, and Martha 
Mc[[Donald]] Nampitjinpa are among the artists who feature regularly in survey shows
of desert painting, and even some of the old-timers, like Emily Andy 
Napaltjarri, who painted for [[War]]umpi Arts in the 90s, have been re-invigorated 
in their practice.

Johnson’s new book documents this living tradition with warmth, affection, and 
fervor. Beautifully illustrated with artworks that capture the [[history]] of 
painting at Papunya for nearly sixty years and with affecting family portraits 
(and in an appendix, extensive family trees), it captures this vital but long 
overlooked chapter in the [[history]] of desert art. It cannot fault to generate 
even more enthusiasm for the constantly evolving sensibilities that have 
sustained Papunya through all its trials. It is a lovely, and loving, testament.
