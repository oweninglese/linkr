tee investigations. Previously, the IAA executive
circulated a questionnaire on agriculture and hous

lated for the committee into a comprehensive
survey of contemporary conditions in those com
munities. A short discussion of reserve [[health]] care
needs was later added to the survey findings. In
this way IAA locals and members across the prov
ince were able to submit short statements outlin

ing their views on housing and agricultural
problems. These statements were probably the most
direct evidence the committee received from a

grassroots level, and they revealed firsthand many
practical issues confronting reserve communities.

The IAA strategically chose agriculture and hous
ing as issues for discussion not only because of
practical reality, but also because these were two

Branch. The surveys appealed to issues already
considered important to the branch, and thereby

contributed to the credibility of the IAA's presen

the minister was more likely responding to outside
pressures from various sources including the 1AA,

rather than acting in an innovative manner.
