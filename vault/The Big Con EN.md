Introduction
In [[2020]], natural disasters were occurring three times
more often than half a century ago.1 2 Already, 2021 is
on track to have some of the most extreme [[climate]]related disasters yet.3 In just the first four months of
the year, record-breaking typhoons,4 5 deadly low
temperatures,6 devastating swarms of locusts,7 and
unprecedented flooding8 have all plagued different
[[corn]]ers of the globe. The common denominator in all
these extreme events is [[climate]] change.

The rate at which the [[climate]] is now changing
is spurring a crisis that risks billions of lives. The
impacts of this crisis are nothing new to [[Indigenous]]
and frontline communities. These communities and
countries have contributed least to the crisis but bear
its consequences first and worst, heaped on top of
centuries of colonialist, racist systems. But as the
impacts on lives and the planet worsen around the
globe, people in the Global [[North]] are becoming more
aware of the realities of the [[climate]] crisis—as well as
other crises, such as hunger, [[health]], and [[poverty]] that
it exacerbates. In recent years more and more people
are joining with young people, [[Indigenous]] Peoples,
frontline communities, women and youth, and people
of colour who have been leading the way to demand
[[climate]] justice.

This surge in activism around the globe—from school
strikes9 to sit-ins at U.N. [[climate]] talks10—has forced
the multiple existential crises we face to the top of
the priority list for [[government]]s, with corporations
and financiers also proclaiming [[climate]] action. These
actors are now scrambling to respond, before this
demand for action grows even louder. But Big Polluters
are responding with the same tricks they have used
as part of a decades-long campaign that involves
greenwashing themselves as the solution on one hand
and deceiving the public while delaying real action on
the other. Instead of offering meaningful real solutions
to justly address the crisis they knowingly created and
owning up to their responsibility to act beginning with
drastically reducing emissions at source, polluting
8

corporations and [[government]]s are advancing “net
zero” plans that require little or nothing in the way
of real solutions or real effective emissions cuts.
Furthermore, and as this report helps illustrate, they
see the potential for a “net zero” global pathway to
provide new business opportunities for them, rather
than curtailing production and consumption of their
polluting products.

After decades of inaction, corporations are suddenly
racing to pledge to achieve “net zero” emissions.
These include fossil fuel giants like BP, Shell, and
Total; tech giants like Microsoft and [[Apple]]; retailers
like Amazon and Walmart; financers like HSBC, Bank
of [[America]], and BlackRock; airlines like [[United]] and
Delta; and food, livestock, and meat producing and
agriculture corporations like JBS, Nestlé, and Cargill.
Polluting corporations are in a race to be the loudest
and proudest to pledge “net zero” emissions by [[2050]]
or some other date in the distant future. Over recent
years, more than 1,500 corporations have made “net
zero” commitments, an accomplishment applauded by
the [[United]] Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC)11 and the U.N. Secretary General.12

But is “net zero” something to be celebrated? Can
these corporations with dismal records of blocking
progress and failing to take meaningful action be
trusted? Are their pledges backed by plans for real
action, and are their plans strengthening democracy
and supporting the priorities of frontline and
[[Indigenous]] communities?

In investigating the answers to these questions, this
report presents clear evidence that “net zero” [[climate]]
plans are simply the latest attempt by polluting
industries, and the neoliberal [[government]]s doing their
bidding, to escape responsibility to act to address
[[climate]] change or to repair the damage they’ve
imposed on ecosystems and frontline communities.
Their proposed plans could even worsen the [[climate]]
crisis.

In the first section, this report summarizes existing
analysis of the ways that “net zero” plans, rather than
representing a credible approach to [[climate]] policy,
are a vehicle for corporate greenwashing by Big
Polluters. Then, in analysing the “net zero” plans of
an array of polluting corporations across sectors, the
report documents in section 2 how these plans are
dangerously masking further pollution and distracting
from real action. And in section 3, through a series of
illustrative examples, the report sheds light on why the
focus on “net zero” by polluters is by design: It is the
culmination of corporate capture of [[climate]] policy by
Big Polluters, secured in part through vast corporate
in[[flu]]ence via lobbying, financial contributions,
in[[flu]]ence in academia, and public relations campaigns.

Finally, this report serves as an urgent call to action for
all involved in global policymaking to change course
now. “Net zero” schemes risk supplanting proven and
meaningful action and instead locking in a polluting
and destructive economy for decades to come. The
planet and its people depend on world [[government]]s
doing everything they can now to cut emissions to
real—not net—zero. Anything else will have deadly
consequences for billions of people’s lives and
livelihoods.

“Net Zero”: The Big Con
WHAT IS “NET ZERO”?
Increasingly, the concept of “net zero” is being
misconstrued in political spaces as well as by individual
actors to evade action and avoid responsibility. The
idea behind Big Polluters’ use of “net zero” is that
an entity can continue to pollute as usual—or even
increase its emissions—and seek to compensate for
those emissions in a number of ways. Emissions are
nothing more than a math equation in these plans;
they can be added one place and subtracted from
another place. This equation is simple in theory
but deeply flawed in reality: These schemes are
being used to mask inaction, foist the burden of
emissions cuts and pollution avoidance on historically

exploited communities, and bet our collective future
through ensuring long-term, destructive impact on
land and forests, oceans, and through advancing
geoengineering technologies, like those listed in the
box on Dangerous Distractions. These technologies
are hugely risky, do not exist at the scale supposedly
needed, and are likely to cause enormous, and likely
irreversible, damage.13 14

CARBON COLONIALISM (CO2LONIALISM)
Historically exploited communities have rightly been
warning that many of these polluters’ schemes, like
offsets and REDD+, entail a new carbon [[colonialism]]. By
labelling them with claims of “net zero,” Big Polluters
are following similar patterns of historic domination,
attempting to paper over neo-[[colonialism]] by using the
language of environ[[mental]] sustainability. They also
shift the burden of [[climate]] action from the countries
and corporations responsible for producing and
consuming emissions, to frontline communities.15 But
the polluting actors that paid for the projects retain
the credit for cutting emissions. This can create a
dynamic where the countries doing the offsets removal
projects disproportionately shoulder the burden
of [[climate]] action while getting little to none of the
credit toward their own Paris Agreement goals. In
the geopolitical context, it also [[corn]]ers countries in
the [[South]] into turning to carbon markets for finance,
since the [[climate]] finance that is owed to them from
countries historically responsible for emissions is
being repeatedly denied. They also risk displacing
people from their land, giving way to land grabs, and
robbing people, particularly [[Indigenous]] Peoples,
smallholder farming communities and women that
steward the land, of their right to food, their cultures
and livelihoods.16 For communities already suffering
the multi-faceted effects of the [[COVID]]-19 [[pandemic]], a
rush of offsets would likely spur compounded disaster.

WHAT ARE BIG POLLUTERS?
Big Polluters are the industries, made up
of corporations and business or [[trade]]
associations that represent them, whose
operations are predominately responsible
for the emissions that have caused and
continue to drive the [[climate]] crisis.17 Just 100
corporations are responsible for 70 percent
of historical emissions.18 While the fossil fuel
industry is a lead actor in this group, the
term also includes other high-emissions and
polluting industries, such as industrial food
and agribusiness (responsible for one-third of
global emissions),19 aviation (a top ten global
emitter),20 logging,21 retail,22 and technology,23
as well as the groups that advance those
industries’ agenda. This also includes financial
institutions and insurers that invest trillions
into polluting and extractive business models.

campaign to muddy the debate, mislead
policymakers, and ultimately stave off action
for generations.30 In the years to come, the
fossil fuel industry was joined by automobile
manufacturers,31 the freight industry,32
the aviation industry,33 utilities,34 industrial
food and agribusiness,35 and many more in
funding and lobbying against common-sense
environ[[mental]] policy in order to maintain
business as usual.

The cynical efforts of these industries have
proven successful: for decades, attempt
after attempt to advance just and meaningful
[[climate]] policy has failed to deliver. This is why
hundreds of thousands of people around the
world have called on [[government]] officials to
address Big Polluters’ conflicting interests and
protect [[climate]] policymaking from the undue
in[[flu]]ence of Big Polluters.

Not only are these industries responsible for
the majority of global emissions to-date, they
are also central to the machine of denial, delay,
and deceit that has led to a global failure to
act to equitably address the [[climate]] crisis.
For decades, Big Polluters have spent untold
sums denying [[climate]] [[[[science]]]], spurring doubt,
and blocking almost every single meaningful
[[climate]] policy put on the table.24 25 26 27 They
have a proven track record of delaying,
deceiving, and denying, and a financial interest
in continuing to pollute, no matter the costs to
people or the planet.

One of the most rigorously documented
examples is the fossil fuel industry’s [[climate]]
denial. As far back as the [[1960]]s, ExxonMobil
and the fossil fuel industry knew the impact
of its operations on the [[climate]].28 29 It buried
the truth, embarking on a decades-long

BIG POLLUTERS’ DANGEROUS DISTRACTIONS
Big Polluters use “net zero” [[climate]] plans to unite a
variety of risky technologies, including geoengineering
technologies, and deeply flawed schemes. Some of
the most common dangerous distractions are below.
The bottom line is that each of them is a smokescreen
that allows for continued emissions, and, if deployed
at large scale, will have significant detri[[mental]]
social, equity, and environ[[mental]] consequences.
Equally funda[[mental]]ly, they distract from the rapid
implementation of real solutions that are needed.

Burning Trees or Biomass (dubbed Bioenergy):
Spinning the burning of trees to produce bioenergy
as a carbon neutral form of renewable energy and
therefore a “net zero” solution. Evidence suggests that
burning trees emits more greenhouse gas emissions
than coal or natural gas, when taking into account
the lifecycle of the emissions and when implemented
at commercial scale.36 37 38 If carried out at the scale
suggested by Big Polluters, burning trees for energy is
also likely to give way to land grabs, biodiversity loss,
and rights violations for [[Indigenous]] Peoples, local
communities, women, and frontline communities.39
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): One of the two
technological proposalses that makes up BECCS (see
below), CCS—also called Carbon Capture and Storage
(CCS) or Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage
(CCUS) is the proposition by Big Polluters that it’s
ok to continue to pollute, if they can somehow suck
up that carbon dioxide, and store it in the ground or
use it in other production to postpone emissions.
However, nearly all existing CCS is used in service of
Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), a process developed by
the oil industry to reach deep oil reserves that would
otherwise be inaccessible and non-viable. 40 “Because
of this, the rebranding of ‘Carbon Capture and Storage’
is misleading and because it portrays CCS as a net
benefit to the [[climate]] when it is mostly used to exploit
more oil and because the process itself requires fossil
fuels to carry out and to power CCS, the consumption
of fossil fuels could increase by up to 40 percent.”41

12

Bioenergy and Carbon Capture and Storage
(BECCS): A combination of two large scale theoretical
technologies that involve growing and burning
biomass, such as trees, to produce energy and then
simultaneously sucking the emissions back out of
the air and somehow storing it underground with
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Not only is it
unproven to be energetically and ecologically viable
and therefore essentially guaranteed to fail, it is also
a threat to human rights, environ[[mental]] justice, and
food security given the amount of land that would be
needed to grow enough biomass to burn, as well as
the particulate matter and harmful pollution that arises
from the combustion of biomass to produce energy.42
43
As with CCS, Big Polluters intend to use this process
not only to continue polluting but for Enhanced Oil
Recovery (EOR) to reach and extract oil in hard-toreach places, leading to even more emissions.
Carbon markets: These allow Big Polluters to continue
polluting and supposedly achieve their emissions
reductions by purchasing “carbon credits” from
other countries or actors that have contributed less
to [[climate]] change. They are proven to lead to fraud

projects as an “offset” for continued fossil fuel use. It is
used by Big Polluters to commodify nature, by allowing
a corporation or [[government]] to compensate for their
emissions by funding projects meant to absorb carbon
emissions (by creating carbon sinks through, for
instance, monoculture [[plantation]]s and other forms of
afforestation and agricultural practices) and claim that
the carbon removal via these projects can balance out
their continued high levels of emissions. Many of these
schemes have been widely discredited and shown to
not only fail to offset the emissions in question or only
do so temporarily,50 but also often drive human rights
abuses.51 52 For more info, see more on REDD+ below.
Carbon offsets: The idea that a polluting actor can
“cancel out” its emissions by investing in projects that
store or reduce carbon, such as forest “conservation”
schemes, that often displace communities, claiming
to reduce deforestation that is usually insignificant,
not permanent or verifiable, as well as monoculture
[[plantation]]s that once cut down for logging, re-emit the
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These have been

proven to not provide real benefit,53 and risk the same
abuses on people and the environment as the other
Dangerous Distractions above.
Hydrogen: This is the latest [[silver]] bullet promoted by
Big Polluters, which they claim will decarbonise the
economy. But in reality, industries’ ‘hydrogen hype’
is about ensuring they can carry on with business
as usual. Big Polluters insist that hydrogen is ‘green’
and will be produced using renewable electricity, but
globally less than 0.1 percent of hydrogen production
is ‘green’,54 with the rest coming mainly from fossil gas.
Big Polluters claim that CCUS technology will make
hydrogen ‘clean’ and ‘low carbon’, while maintaining
their destructive business models—and even receiving
massive public subsidies to do so.55 So-called ‘green’
hydrogen is also highly problematic: [[North]]ern
countries and their corporations are planning to exploit
[[South]]ern communities and their resources to produce
it for their own ‘green’ consumption. Hydrogen is now
a main stay within the “net zero” plans of all Big Oil and
Gas majors.56

and speculation, and haven’t substantially reduced
emissions.44 45 Not only do they attempt to compensate
for emissions after the fact and fail to hold Big Polluters
accountable, they often provide a further moneymaking opportunity for corporations. For example,
Cargill is seeking to become a carbon offset developer
itself, selling these dangerous schemes to others.46 47
Direct Air Capture (DAC): The notion that Big Polluters
can keep polluting and develop technology down the
line that sucks the carbon dioxide from back out of the
air. Like BECCS, this technology is untested at large
scale, is very risky and extremely energy-intensive,48
and is unlikely to ever work at the scale required on
the timeline needed in a fair manner.49 In order to store
the carbon dioxide once it has been extracted from
the atmosphere, DAC technology will likely need to
work in combination with CCS or CCUS. It is therefore
additionally dependent on yet more technologies that
may never be effective at scale.
Nature-Based Solutions (NBS): When used by Big
Polluters, this is a new name for the old idea of
promoting large scale [[plantation]]s and conservation

CASE STUDY- WHY REDD+ IS JUST ANOTHER
DANGEROUS DISTRACTION
Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest
degradation (or REDD+, with the “+” representing
“forest conservation and enhancing forest carbon
stocks”), is a program launched under the UNFCCC
more than 15 years ago.57 The idea was that it would
reduce emissions by financially incentivising actors
to avoid deforestation and forest degradation. But
in the one and a half decades since it began being
implemented, it has proved hugely controversial and
anything but a success.58 59 60 61 62 Through seeking to
financialize nature and put a [[trade]]able price on it, it has
also failed to deliver its vision of reducing emissions to
the scale suggested.63

Since its launch, more than 350 REDD+ projects
across 53 countries have been established with a price
tag of more than 24 billion euros in public finance.64
Collectively, these projects cover a land area the size of
Morocco.

REDD+ has been described as “one of the most
controversial environ[[mental]] policies that has ever
existed. It has divided [[government]]s, civil society and
[[Indigenous]] Peoples’ organizations, and proved to
be highly controversial within the [[United]] Nations
itself”.65 Though polluters and some conservation
NGOs continue to promote REDD+ as a [[climate]]
solution, human rights groups and [[Indigenous]] Peoples’
organizations have consistently reiterated its role as a
“facilitator of dispossession and resource extraction,
and a false solution to the [[climate]] crisis,”66 and as a
“scheme that consolidates corporate control over
territory and expands profits”.67

in the greatest number possible, regardless of
whether this approach works in the context of
natural ecosystems.
2 Violates the rights and disrespects the cultures
of [[Indigenous]] forest communities. They can be
displaced from their traditional land and left out
of decision-making processes that directly impact
their livelihoods.
3 Lacks mechanisms that consistently address
systemic weaknesses, such as how to ensure that
protecting forest in one place doesn’t simply shift
the deforestation to another, as well as questions
of accurately quantifying and accounting for
emissions.
4 Can lead to or promote a variety of devastating
impacts, including land grabs, forced displacement,
militarization, and loss of livelihoods and
biodiversity. These varying impacts have been
documented through published reports and media
coverage.

Despite these shortcomings and its consistent
controversy, REDD+ has continued to be propped up
as a solution to the [[climate]] crisis by polluting countries
and corporations.

REDD+’s shortcomings include that it:

THE FOUR CONCEPTUAL FLAWS OF “NET ZERO”
CLIMATE PLANS
The problems with Big Polluters’ “net zero” emissions
plans are numerous, but there are four profound flaws
worth highlighting here.

First, the vast majority of these plans are centred on
a “net zero” by [[2050]] timeline with little action taken
to reduce emissions at source for decades—far too
long a timeline for a credible emissions reduction
plan that ensures we keep global temperature rise
to below 1.5 degrees Celsius.68 Many of these plans
lack real benchmarks between now and [[2050]], which
allows business as usual for decades before any
action is required69 and ignore basic principles of
global equity, which demand that wealthier entities
act fastest to reduce emissions and provide support
for others to follow. And yet, when these plans are
announced, those behind them receive the brand
benefit or credibility without ever having to do the
work of cutting emissions. In both cases, that’s far too
little, far too late,70 given we need to undertake the
transformative work necessary to drastically decrease
emission by [[2030]] at the latest.71

Second, these plans rely on highly improbable schemes
to make the emissions disappear, as if by magic. (See
the Dangerous Distractions box.) In some instances,
this looks like technofixes that don’t yet exist, or don’t
exist at scale, like carbon capture and storage.72 These
technologies have numerous challenges, not the least
of which is that they are likely to sustain or increase
emissions and consumption of emissions-intensive
products like fossil gas, and spur tremendous harm
to communities that risk being displaced or adversely
affected. They would also ensure the continuation of
a host of other ecological and human rights abuses
associated with fossil fuels, such as methane emissions
and water contamination from fracking and oil drilling,
as well as pipeline leaks and explosions. Furthermore,
they may not work—in some cases capturing only 10
percent of actual emissions rather than the unfounded
claims of 85 – 90 percent.73

In other instances, suggesting these emission can
disappear looks like so-called “Nature Based Solutions”.
These schemes overlook the reality that the world’s
natural carbon sinks such as forests cannot be forced
to absorb more carbon, or absorb it faster, just because
Big Polluters are burning fossil fuels at a reckless rate.74
75
There’s also the reality that Earth’s nature does
not have enough capacity to absorb the amount of
carbon that all these “net zero” commitments imply. In
addition, some of the programs Big Polluters invest in
have been found to invest in projects that would have
happened regardless, and in others are found to cause
an overall increase in emissions. A recent investigation
by the Guardian and Unearthed found that carbon
offsets in the form of forest preservation being used
by major airlines to claim “carbon-neutral flying” were
“based on a flawed and much-criticised system” —a
situation justifiably described as “scandalous”.76

Thirdly, the concept of “net zero” as enshrined in the
Paris Agreement assumes one tonne of carbon emitted
from any source has the same value as one tonne
of carbon sequestered. But this ignores profound
differences between the longevity and stability of
geological and terrestrial carbon stocks (from burning
fossil fuels).77 “Net” targets based on this assumption
are, therefore, inherently flawed and perpetuate the
myth that business as usual emissions can continue in
one sector and be removed somewhere else.78

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, “net zero”
schemes ignore the simple truth that the [[climate]]
crisis is not a problem of technology but a problem
of political will and entrenched power relations. We
have the just solutions we need to address the [[climate]]
crisis.79 80 81 82 Communities on the front lines of the
crisis have been demanding these solutions for years.
What we lack are the policies that would require drastic
emissions reductions and fast track the implementation
of these solutions. And we lack them because the same
polluters now pushing “net zero” have spent decades
interfering in [[climate]] policy and muddying the public
discourse.83 84 85 86 87

Total projects an increase of 50 percent in groupwide production of oil and gas between [[2015]] and [[2025]].235
Total plans to decrease Scope three emissions (meaning the indirect emissions associated with its entire value chain) only in [[Europe]]
(specifically the [[EU]], [[UK]], and Norway).236 These are countries that already have existing “net zero” national policies. In other words, it
is pledging to do the minimum presumably required to keep operating in those countries— and only those countries.
Rather than decrease emissions at source, Shell plans to increase its liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations by 20 percent through
[[2025]].237 238
Shell is still planning to spend US$8 billion annually on oil and gas production, and US$4 billion a year in fossil gas.239
Shell’s plan relies on offsetting 120 million tonnes of CO2 a year by [[2030]]. That’s more for this one corporation than the entire global
voluntary carbon offset market capacity in [[2019]]: 104 million tonnes of CO2.240

A large part (one-third) of its oil and gas production comes from its 20 percent stake in [[Russia]]n oil [[company]] Rosneft.241 This

BP is the largest shareholder in the U.S.’ largest forest carbon offsets developer, a major financial conflict of interest.243

Chevron’s bar for [[climate]] action is among the lowest of them all. It hasn’t even officially pledged to achieve “net zero”, only recently
announcing that it sees a “pathway toward net zero”.246
Chevron’s business plans could hardly spell business as usual more clearly. It is still intending on being a fossil fuel-based [[company]]
for the next 10 or even 20 years.247
The [[UK]]’s biggest polluter and world’s biggest tree burner claimed to be the first [[company]] in the world to announce an ambition to
become carbon negative by [[2030]] in [[December]] [[2019]].248 To do so, Drax is relying on unproven Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and
Storage (BECCS) technology from tree burning, leading to even more forest destruction and monoculture tree [[plantation]]s.249
These false solutions fail to avoid emissions and are also a further money-making opportunity for Drax- Drax Power Station currently
receives over £2 million in [[UK]] [[government]] subsidies daily.250

Finance

In [[February]] 2021, the world’s largest producer of wood pellets pledged to achieve “net zero” emissions by [[2030]].251 In its
announcement, the corporation did not specify how much it would directly reduce emissions, but Enviva said it planned to
purchase forest offsets to compensate for all emissions it doesn’t avoid, with a focus on forest offsets programs in the US [[South]]east

Enviva has a keen business interest in the U.S. [[South]]east and stands to profit more than the [[climate]] from these forest offset

Enviva’s mills rather than left to absorb carbon.

In order to account for the emissions Eni is intending to offset, it will need nearly 8 million hectares of land every year by [[2030]].244
Not only is this amount of land unsustainable, but Eni has not addressed where this land will be, or the potential implications to local
communities that may be depending on that land.
Eni still plans to increase its oil and gas production until [[2025]].245

Delta announced its intention to invest US$1 billion over next 10 years to help compensate for its emissions.262 This amount
(notably, only a fraction of its profits) is in many ways a catch-all fund that encompasses much of the spending it was already
intending to make to support its business growth, such as new planes.
Delta is offering Deloitte and corporate customers “sustainable” air travel packages for these corporate customers to offset their
own emissions.263 It counts these flights as part of its own reduction even if supposedly more sustainable biofuels aren’t being used
for that flight.
One of the programs in Zimbabwe Delta buys credits from to offset its emissions is “undermin[ing] livelihoods” and is
“strongly opposed” by local communities,264 despite Delta insisting it “protects forests…while supporting the wellbeing of local

EasyJet is opting to buy offsets to compensate for its emissions, at a price so low it has no incentive to reduce emissions anytime
soon: US$4.3/tCO2.266 This is a fraction of the price currently used under the [[EU]]-ETS, an emissions trading scheme that has resulted
in massive profits for Big Polluters and not reduced emissions as promised.267
EasyJet is using political interference to stop [[climate]] action: It lobbied against environ[[mental]] taxes on flights—until it was offered

[[United]]’s plan does not detail any specific action it will take to reduce its emissions time before [[2030]].259 Instead, its plan assumes the vast

[[United]]’s investment in DAC could even lead to greater fossil fuel extraction—and greater profit for it and other corporations.260 The

fossil fuels in hard-to-reach places.

JBS pledged to invest US$1 billion over the next decade in its “net zero” program (without detailing what this program entails) and
to allocate US$100 million by [[2030]] in “[[research]] and development projects” for carbon capture and “on-farm emissions mitigation
technologies” — in other words, carbon offsets. 275
JBS’ commitment to eliminate deforestation in its supply chain by [[[[2035]]]] in effect means it will continue contributing to
deforestation for the next 14 years (until [[[[2035]]]]), instead of immediately ending the deforestation associated with its supply chain—
arguably one of the most effective and quickest ways for JBS to decrease its emissions.
Rather than decreasing the production of its most emission-intensive products such as industrial meat and dairy, analysis by Grain
found that Nestlé is planning on increasing production of dairy, livestock, and commodity products by 68 percent by [[2030]].276 It’s
intending to rely primarily on offset credits to make up for this drastic increase in emissions.
The US$1.2 billion Nestlé has pledged to invest in “regenerative agricultural practices”, which can include destructive practices and
is questionable in terms of carbon sequestration, is a miniscule 1.5 percent of the sum it transferred to shareholders in [[2020]].277
One of the programs Nestlé has invested in to improve agriculture practices, 4R Nutrient Stewardship Programme, led to more

CORPORATE “NET ZERO” FRENZY: THE GREAT
GREENWASH
In [[2020]], analysis by Oil Change International
evidenced the total failure of [[climate]] plans of eight Big
Oil and Gas majors to meet even the basic pillars of
real [[climate]] action in line with the Paris Agreement’s
commitment of keeping global temperature rise to 1.5
degrees Celsius.88 But this failure goes way beyond Big
Oil and Gas, as analysis by contributors of this report
and others of the “net zero” [[climate]] action plans of
major polluters across sectors reveals.

Table 1 summarizes just some of the facts that illustrate
why 17 corporate “net zero” [[climate]] commitments
spanning the fossil fuel, energy, food, agriculture,
technology, finance, aviation, and retail industries are
anything but real action. Across the board, while these
corporations are proclaiming [[climate]] championship in
the form of “net zero” promises, the fine print of their
plans tells a very different story—that they will stop at
nothing to continue to pocket a profit, and that they
have little to no intention of decreasing emissions.
In addition to Table 1, additional case studies provide
a deeper dive into the specific loopholes of the “net

For example, [[United]] Airlines is counting on building
carbon direct air capture plants to be able to use
Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology that doesn’t exist
yet to literally hope to suck carbon out of the air and
pump it into the ground (a process, by the way, that
is intended to be used for Enhanced Oil Recovery
to extract even more oil in hard-to-reach places).
Walmart’s [[climate]] plan entirely overlooks Scope three
emissions (meaning the emissions associated with the
products it sells), a type of emissions that counts for an
estimated 95 percent of its carbon footprint. Fossil gas
will continue to represent 90 percent of oil major Eni’s
production and it is still planning to increase oil and
gas production over the coming years, a feat that the
corporation proposes will be compensated for through
reforestation schemes that have been criticised as
fake forests.92 93 BlackRock, the world’s largest asset
manager, has pledged to reach “net zero” emissions
in its portfolio by [[2050]]. But despite pledging in [[2020]]
to sell off most of its fossil fuel shares “in the near
future”, it still owns US$85 billion in coal assets due to
a “loophole” in its policy. The list of failings goes on
and on and on.

Initially, this report was intended to analyse the
quantifiable aspects of Big Polluters’ “net zero”
[[climate]] action plans collectively. The authors set out
to examine the details of these plans as a whole and
quantify the amount of land that would be needed to
offset the intended emissions, to determine whether
such plans were possible within planetary constraints.
(Others such as ActionAid International89, Grain90
and [[Greenpeace]]91 have tried to do some of this
quantification with individual corporate “net zero”
plans). But collectively, the plans of these Big Polluters
are so vague that it was impossible to understand
how the corporations are planning on achieving “net
zero”. Therefore, this calculation was impossible
without making too many assumptions. The lack of
detail further drives home the reality that these plans
represent corporate lip service with no clear pathway—
not real action.

EIGHT FUNDAMENTAL FAILINGS
As Table 1 and these deeper dives help illustrate, the
flaws of these Big Polluter “net zero” plans are vast. But
central to most of them are eight funda[[mental]] failings:

??

Disguise the intent to ramp up emissionsintensive production: Their business plans
show that in most cases, these corporations are
continuing to project for major growth of highemissions or polluting products.

Rely on Dangerous Distractions, not
real solutions: The plans rely primarily on
mechanisms that don’t reduce emissions, such
as carbon offsetting, as well as on futuristic,
unproven, and dangerous geoengineering
technologies such as Bioenergy with Carbon
Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air
Capture (DAC) that are unlikely to ever work at
scale and guaranteed to cause great harm to
communities, ecosystems, and biodiversity.

Ignorant of [[[[science]]]] and logic: The lack of
credible [[[[science]]]] and data suggests the authors
of these plans know and choose to ignore
the fact that these “net zero” plans, combined
with continued growth projections and lack
of decreasing emissions at source, are not
possible at the scale suggested.

$

20

Impossible arithmetic: There is literally not
enough available land for all the proposals
to remove by various means (tree planting,
ecosystem reforestation, etc.) all of the
corporate and [[government]] emissions that they
propose to maintain or increase.

Too vague to mean anything: Their systematic
failure to detail concrete plans to decrease
emissions at source. This vagueness is likely
designed to deflect deeper scrutiny.

Investment in the status quo: The plans
channel corporate finance into funding
organizations and initiatives that are focused
on dangerous schemes, rather than proven
real solutions and real emissions reductions
controlled and led by frontline communities.

$

Profit over people and the planet: The plans
blatantly disregard the needs and priorities of
[[Indigenous]] Peoples, frontline, peasant, and
historically exploited communities whose
lands, livelihoods, cultures, and lives will be
directly impacted and undermined as a result
of these plans.

Rejection of systemic change: Globally,
people recognize that corporate power,
structural [[racism]], [[colonialism]], and other
systemic issues are driving [[climate]] change
and other crises—and are demanding systems
change. But through these “net zero” plans, the
exploiters, abusers, and extractors that built a
broken system that destroys the planet for their
profit are attempting to position themselves
as the “fixers”. In doing so, they plan to lock in,
rather than transform, these broken systems.

Across sectors, Big Polluters have no intention of
real [[climate]] action now, or anytime soon. And as this
analysis makes clear, their “net zero” promises are as
empty as all the countless others they have made over
the past decades and are being used to attempt to trick
the public into believing that they can still supposedly
be the solution to the very crisis they caused.

CASE STUDY- JBS’ “NET ZERO” PLAN: A
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE DEFORESTATION BY
THE WORLD’S LARGEST MEAT PRODUCER
In [[March]] 2021, and the day after it announced record
profits,94 JBS, the world’s biggest meat producer,
committed to eliminate deforestation across its
global supply chain by [[[[2035]]]], and to address emissions
throughout its supply chain (Scope 1-3) to reach “net
zero” emissions by [[2040]].95

JBS pledged to invest US$ 1 billion over the next
decade in its “net zero” program (without detailing
what this program entails) and to allocate US$
100 million by [[2030]] in “[[research]] and development
projects”. The two kinds of projects it highlighted as a
priority include carbon capture and “on-farm emissions
mitigation technologies” - in other words, carbon
offsets. 96 (For more information about why these
schemes are not real solutions that avoid emissions,
see the Dangerous Distractions box). Beyond this, the
details are fuzzy as JBS has yet to provide a roadmap
to detail exactly how it will fulfil the components of its
“net zero” pledge.

JBS’ commitment to eliminate deforestation in its
supply chain by [[[[2035]]]] is both worrying and overdue. It’s
overdue because JBS is already linked to over 100,000
hectares of deforestation in Brazil (more than any other
meat producer in the Brazilian Amazon), an estimated
3/4 of which might be illegal.97 It’s worrying because
in effect the timeline for this essentially means it will
continue contributing to deforestation for the next 14
years (until [[[[2035]]]]), instead of immediately ending the
deforestation associated with its supply chain, arguably
one of the most effective and quickest ways for JBS to
decrease its emissions.

The corporation’s worrying track record goes well
beyond its alleged illegal deforestation. In [[2017]], its
parent [[company]] agreed to pay US$3.2 billion to settle a
case that claimed it bribed 1,900 politicians in Brazil.98
This is one of the biggest fines in corporate [[history]].

CASE STUDY- SHELL’S “NET ZERO” COMMITMENTS:
A ROADMAP FOR BUSINESS AS USUAL
Shell has committed to becoming a “net zero
emissions energy business by [[2050]]” and claims that
its total carbon emissions peaked in [[2018]].99 It has
also committed to reduce emissions from consumers
burning the fossil fuels that it extracts and refines. But
an analysis of the details of its plans belies its claims
and exposes chinks in its armour. As do the words of
its own chief executive Ben van Beurden, who was
quoted as recently as [[2019]] saying, “Despite what a lot
of activists say, it is entirely legitimate to invest in oil
and gas because the world demands it”.100

Shell has committed to gradually reduce oil production
by around 1-2 percent each year through divestments
and natural decline. Yet Shell’s communication to its
shareholders indicate that the corporation’s oil and gas
production will continue to make up a large share of its
budget at US$8 billion.101 In addition, it will still spend
US$4 billion on its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business
and up to US$5 billion on chemicals and refining. Shell
plans to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes
and markets to deliver more than 7 million tonnes per
annum of new capacity by [[2025]].

To achieve its “net zero” by [[2050]] commitment, Shell
aims to rely on the use of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS)
to compensate for its emissions. By [[[[2035]]]], Shell will also
need to capture and store 25 million tonnes of carbon
a year. Shell also proposes to compensate for a total
emissions of around 120 million tonnes a year by [[2030]],
and wants to establish a global NBS market.102 This is
unrealistic, given the entire voluntary carbon offset
market (meaning the offsets available to purchase by
all global actors) in [[2019]] was only 104 million tonnes.
The sheer magnitude of Dangerous Distractions Shell
is relying on to achieve “net zero” clearly points to its
intention to continue to pollute rather than decrease
emissions at source.

According to Carbon Brief, Shell’s global energy vision
“Sky 1.5” lays out a vision for the world that plans for
the continued use of oil, gas, and coal until the end

of the century, which is also indicative of its own
intention.103 This global scenario also proposes a major

its offsetting projects will spur jobs and have “a positive
impact on several thousand people”.110 It also pledged

reforestation programme that will require 700 million
hectares of land over the century, an area close to the
size of Brazil.104

to start a fund to support [[health]] and education in
neighbouring villages. But it has disclosed no details
about these plans, nor whether any of this has even
been discussed with these communities, or if they are
even aware of the potential that they may be evicted
from this land.

Shell is hiding its business as usual scenario behind a
façade of “net zero”. In the words of Professor Wim
Carton of Lund University: “If we start normalising
the use of these planetary scale negative emissions, it
allows a [[company]] like Shell to basically claim they are
in line with apparently whatever [[climate]] target you
come up with, just by assuming large-scale negative
emissions and at the same time saying we need to
invest in oil and gas development”.105

CASE STUDY- TOTAL SA: GRABBING LAND IN
THE CONGO TO REACH “NET ZERO” AND AVOID
REDUCING EM[[[[ISS]]I]]ONS
Total SA has pledged to achieve “net zero” emissions
by [[2050]].106 Part of its plans involves eyeing up more
than 10 million hectares of land reserve in [[Africa]] to
plant trees.107 But where will this land come from,
and is it Total’s to take? And can any number of trees
scientifically or morally accommodate for Total’s
intention to continue to pollute?

The type of trees Total plants are also problematic. In
their projects in the Congo, they have reportedly used
foreign trees from [[Australia]] or Asia, that undermine
local biodiversity and risk destroying the natural
ecosystem.111 Moreover, Total intends to cut down the
trees and process them for wood or energy. So there
is little, if any, environ[[mental]] benefits. In reality, Total
is likely creating a wood farm using invasive species of
trees under the guise of [[climate]] action.

Total’s eagerness to demonstrate its commitment to
[[climate]] action in the Congo is likely not coincidental.
In [[2019]], it acquired a permit for further oil exploration,
a deal that has been described as a “[[death]]-knell for this
globally important habitat for people and wildlife”.112

On 16 [[March]] 2021, Total SA and [[French]] consultancy
firm Forêt Ressources Management (FRM) signed an
agreement with the Republic of Congo to plant a
40,000-hectare forest on the Batéké Plateaux.108 Total’s
intention was that the planted trees would serve as a
carbon sink that will sequester more than 10 million
tons of carbon dioxide over 20 years. This is just one of
many deals Total will need to strike in order to claim it
is “compensating” for its continued emissions.

But much of this land in this area of the Congo is
home to Aka [[Indigenous]] Pygmies and Bantu farmers.
Mapping of this land suggests that it is used to sustain
the lives and cultures of these communities and is
looked after by them.109 It is likely that they would be
evicted from these lands by Total or the [[government]].
Total has not publicly addressed this, claiming only that

Securing a “net-zero” tax credit in the U.S.

How Big Polluters are
orchestrating their way out
of their [[climate]] crimes with
“net zero”

Strategy 1:
The buy off: Buy political
goodwill to help secure “net
zero” policies

How did we get here? In a matter of years, “net zero”
has gone from a concept in scientific discussion
to increasingly forming the foundation for weak
“net zero” plans have taken hold of mainstream
discourse—and become the predominant approach
for corporations and [[government]]s alike. Beyond
exa[[mining]] corporate “net zero” plans and their
loopholes, this report aims to shed light on how “net
zero” came to be the [[climate]] buzzword of the day.
The findings indicate that, more than simply using “net
zero” pledges to greenwash their plans to continue
to pollute, Big Polluters play a key role in shaping “net
zero” as a distraction—working behind the scenes to
displace real solutions. “Net zero” is the final play in
their great escape from responsibility for the [[climate]]
crisis.

Though there’s absolutely no excuse for this
manipulation and neglect, the multitude of loopholes
of these so-called corporate [[climate]] action plans
shouldn’t come as a surprise, given who these actors
are and what their track record is. Big Polluters
have a decades-long, evidenced [[history]] of delaying,
deceiving, and denying. Some of them knew more than
half a century ago about the dangerous implications of
their products and business practices.

Big Polluters have deployed a variety of tactics to keep
polluting and profiting. Our analysis illustrates that
“net zero” is simply the latest, nefarious evolution of
Big Polluters’ campaign of obstruction and delay. The
strategies outlined here will be familiar to anyone who
has studied Big Polluters’—or Big Tobacco’s—playbook.
What’s new is how they’ve applied this playbook
to position “net zero” squarely at the centre of the
policymaking table—displacing real solutions in the
process.

Strategy 2:
The lobbyist lock-in: In[[flu]]ence
policy to lock in “net zero”
agenda
Strategy 3:
The deck stacking: Shape
academic [[research]] to validate
“net zero”

STRATEGY 1: THE BUY OFF: BUY POLITICAL
GOODWILL TO SECURE “NET ZERO” POLICIES
The lobbying machine of the industries pushing “net
zero” schemes is formidable. It is the same machine
that undermined and weakened the Kyoto Protocol113
114 115
—not to mention just about every concerted effort
to advance meaningful [[climate]] policy in countries like
the [[United]] [[States]] that are the most responsible for
historic emissions. It counts on individual corporate
lobbyists alongside some of the most powerful [[trade]]
associations in the world, like the [[America]]n Petroleum
Institute116 117 118 and the US Chamber of Commerce.119
These groups are so effective and in[[flu]]ential that
they have not only been able to stop real solutions
from taking hold, but also they’ve advanced policies
that enhance the profits of their members and clients.
120 121

One such example of a policy that undermines real
solutions while propping up profits of polluters via
“net zero” related schemes is a tax credit in the [[United]]
[[States]] called the 45Q tax credit. The development
of the 45Q tax credit provides a snapshot of the
ways Big Polluters shape political conditions that are
favourable to their “net zero” scheming. The [[United]]
[[States]] Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q credit
subsidises corporations for activities associated with
Carbon Capture and Storage, even if this process itself
is used to extract more oil or gas.122 In other words, this
policy financially incentivises polluters for tinkering
with false solutions instead of making the adjustments
necessary to stop polluting, advance real solutions, and
decrease emissions. Between [[2010]] and [[2019]], just ten
corporations claimed 99.9 percent of the US$1 billion
that was credited for claiming to capture carbon.123

In [[2020]], an investigation by the [[United]] [[States]] Inspector
General for Tax Administration found that the 45Q
credit was being hugely misused, especially by the
handful of corporations that had claimed almost all the
tax credit to-date.124 The investigation found that only
three of these ten corporations had some mechanism
in place to qualify for the credit. While the Internal
Revenue Service has refused to disclose the names of
these corporations,125 because of their stated intent to
rely on these technologies and thus continue pollution,
it is reasonable to assume that many of the polluting
corporations discussed elsewhere in the report make
up part of these ten, especially given the lobbying for
this credit that is documented below. [[Congress]]ional
staff members were reported saying that they had
reason to believe the largest credit went to Exxon, and
estimates suggest Exxon could be positioned to claim
up to US$70 million a year through this credit for just
one of its CCS plants.126

Even with the tax credit’s proven misuse, and its
funda[[mental]] flaw of incentivising the continued use
of fossil fuels, a policy proposal was tagged onto the
Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 that sought
to extend this tax credit through [[2025]].127 This policy

paved the way for [[climate]] inaction under the guise
of “net zero” and displaced policies focused on real
solutions that sought to address the [[climate]] crisis.

Big Polluters didn’t leave the passing of this “net zero”
centred legislation to chance. Instead, they pulled the
puppet strings to help see the bill through to passage.
For starters, the likes of Exxon,128 Chevron,129 BP,130
Shell,131 [[America]]n Airlines,132 Amazon,133 Walmart,134
BlackRock135 and Microsoft136 all lobbied in relation to
the bill.

Big Polluters financially cosied up to the sponsor and
four co-sponsors of the bill over the course of [[2019]]
and [[2020]]*:
•

The oil and gas industry contributed more than
US$227,000 to the sponsor’s, Rep. Henry Cuellar,
campaign—more than any other industry.137 This
included US$12,500 from Chevron, and US$10,000
from Exxon.138

•

Co-sponsor Rep. Michael McCaul received over
US$190,000 from the oil and gas industry and
well over US$50,000 from both the retail and air
transport industries.139 This included individual
contributions from Exxon, Chevron, Amazon, and
Delta Airlines.140 Chevron ranked the 8th highest
individual contributor.141

•

Co-sponsor Rep. Vicente Gonzalez received
nearly US$150,000 from the oil and gas industry142
—including contributions from Exxon and
Chevron143—more than from any other industry.

These sums may seem small, especially compared to
the mammoth profits these corporations turn. But
this in and of itself is telling- how much in[[flu]]ence
they secure for relatively so little. Ultimately their
puppeteering seemed to do the trick, and the impacts
for people and the planet are anything but small. In
[[December]] [[2020]], the bill passed, formally extending
this tax credit for false solutions through at least
[[2025]] despite is misuse already being systematically
documented.
* According to data registered on OpenSecrets.org

25

Even so, these corporations are wasting no time
celebrating their success. Just months after the
passage of the bill, in [[March]] 2021 bipartisan legislation
was introduced to the [[United]] [[States]] Senate to extend
the 45Q tax credit through [[2030]].144 The sponsor
of the amendment act for extension of the tax
credit, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, has received over
US$300,000 from the oil and gas industry and nearly
US$170,000 from the air transport industry.145 She
received contributions from [[companies]], including
over US$100,000 in contributions from Exxon, 146
Chevron,147 [[America]]n Airlines,148 Delta Airlines,149
Amazon,150 Microsoft,151 DuPont,152 and Walmart.153

This is just one example of political manipulation in
one country where many polluting corporations are
headquartered. Consider that similar strings are almost
certainly being pulled in countries around the globe,
on a daily basis. For a comparable example of how
Big Polluters are advancing similar policies to displace
real solutions with dangerous distractions like CCS in
the [[EU]], read “The Hydrogen Hype”.154 By pulling these
strings, polluting corporations are orchestrating their
great “net zero” escape.

STRATEGY 2: THE LOBBYIST LOCK-IN: INFLUENCE
POLICY TO LOCK IN “NET ZERO” AGENDA
For as long as the UNFCCC—the main international
space for global collaboration on [[climate]] policy—has
existed, Big Polluters have undermined equitable and
strong policy proposals from [[climate]] justice activists.

They are able to in[[flu]]ence and undermine [[climate]]
policy by securing access to policymakers and
decision-making processes through sponsorship of
negotiations and high-profile events,155 156 lobbying in
corridors via their industry [[trade]] groups,157 158 or even
negotiating on behalf of [[government]] delegations.159
They also aggressively lobby at the national level to
advance their interests. This phenomenon—called
corporate capture—is the biggest contributor to
under[[mining]] political will and the largest barrier to
accomplishing a strong and equitable global response

26

to [[climate]] change.160 161 At the UNFCCC, their
puppeteering has helped lead to a Paris Agreement
that is much weaker than it needs to be. Among other
outcomes, it is voluntary rather than binding, doesn’t
require specific emissions cuts or even mention oil
or gas, and doesn’t commit to the needed levels of
[[climate]] finance. Big Polluters have publicly admitted
to their interference: David Hone, Shell’s Climate
Change Advisor, was quoted “tak[ing] some credit”
for successfully embedding carbon markets into the
Paris Agreement.162 He went as far as to say that the
policy proposals they developed are even reflected
in the Paris Agreement itself and its guidelines for
implementation.

One of the leaders of this push at the UNFCCC is the
International Emissions Trading Association (IETA).
IETA was founded and is still run by fossil fuel giants
like BP, Shell, and Chevron.163 It’s funded by more
than 170 corporations, banks, and firms. Its expressed
mission is to advance carbon markets, and it does so
very successfully on behalf of its Big Polluter members.
And its primary objective at the UNFCCC has been to
force weakly regulated carbon market mechanisms
into the centre of international [[climate]] policy, most
recently via a section of the Paris Agreement, called
Article 6. Carbon markets are directly related to
“net zero” pathways, as in the words of IETA, the
“voluntary carbon market has an important role to
play in delivering the goals of the Paris Agreement and
supporting the journey to “net zero”. 164

When world [[government]]s come together at the
UNFCCC’s 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26)
currently set to be held in Glasgow at the end of 2021,
[[government]]s are meant to agree to the rules for how
Article 6, and thus carbon markets, can be used in
the delivery of the Paris Agreement commitments.165
If IETA, polluting corporations, and wealthy polluting
countries like the [[United]] [[States]], [[Australia]], and [[EU]]
countries are successful, then carbon markets will
continue displacing the real, proven, and equitable
solutions we need to justly address the [[climate]] crisis. If
this happens, we are guaranteed to far surpass the 1.5
degrees Celsius threshold.166

A bird’s eye view of IETA’s presence at the UNFCCC
reveals that it leaves nothing to chance in key
moments where Big Polluters’ interests and carbon
markets can be advanced in international policymaking
spaces.
Figure 1 shows the number of individuals IETA brought
to the UNFCCC during key moments where carbon
markets could be advanced. It also compares this to
the average size of [[government]] delegations, illustrating
how IETA can position itself to have outsized power
and in[[flu]]ence during these negotiations. For example,
at COP11 in Montreal, where 21 historic decisions
were adopted that officialised carbon markets and
offsetting schemes in the Kyoto Protocol, IETA brought
402 people to the talks, while the average [[government]]
delegation size was only 15.

industry and [[trade]] associations that use their direct
access to these negotiations to advance their corporate
interests. Other industry groups representing Big
Polluter interests with deep in[[flu]]ence in policymaking
processes include the likes of the International
Chamber of Commerce, Business[[Europe]], the [[United]]
[[States]] Chamber of Commerce, and the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development.172 173 174 175 Their
collective in[[flu]]ence is a critical reason why across the
board, the global response to address [[climate]] change
is grossly inadequate and wholly unjust. Instead of real,
affordable, and people-centred solutions, the world’s
response to the [[climate]] crisis rests on a crumbling
foundation of false solutions like carbon markets,
offsetting schemes, and “Nature Based Solutions”.

At the UNFCCC, IETA is also remarkably savvy at
cosying up to [[climate]] policymakers, [[government]]
delegates, and in some cases even the secretariat
of the UNFCCC itself. At COP25 in Madrid in [[2019]],
IETA held a side event giving an update on Article
6. A legal officer from the UNFCCC Secretariat staff
presented alongside IETA, a public illustration of their
partnership.167 168 In another IETA sponsored event
about carbon markets and Article 6 during COP25, the
same Shell executive who bragged about in[[flu]]encing
the Paris Agreement presented alongside a Head of
Division for [[EU]] Climate and Energy Policy, Federal
Ministry for the Environment.169 IETA also presented
the [[United]] [[King]]dom with an “IETA Net Zero Award” in
“recognition of its outstanding approach to enabling
private sector finance to meet a net zero emissions
goal”.170 These are just a few illustrations of the
conflicting relationship between policymakers and
these polluting interests—and how IETA uses those
relationships to trumpet its “net zero” narrative. IETA’s
engagement at the UNFCCC is littered with more of
the same, and an IETA honorary board member and
former president Andrei Marcu has actually negotiated
on behalf of a country.171

When it comes to Big Polluters’ stranglehold over
international policy, IETA is just one of countless

IETA’s in[[flu]]ence at the U.N. [[climate]] talks is in part illustrated through
the sheer dominance of its official delegations- i.e., the number
of people it takes to negotiations. Often it has among the largest
delegations of any non-[[government]]al organization, and its delegations
often significantly overshadow delegations from some of the countries
hardest hit by [[climate]] change. This timeline illustrates the size of
IETA’s delegation at the U.N. [[climate]] talks since the industry group was
founded, compared to the average [[government]] delegation size in key
moments where carbon markets were advanced.

STRATEGY 3: THE DECK STACKING: SHAPE
ACADEMIC RESEARCH TO VALIDATE “NET ZERO”
[[Research]] and innovation coming out of the world’s
leading academic institutions play a critical role in
setting the bar for what [[climate]] ambition looks like, as
well as in shaping national and international [[climate]]
policy. If prestigious academic experts produce
[[research]] and launch initiatives in favour of “net zero”,
then policymakers and [[government]]s are likely to follow
this lead—especially if this [[research]] provides policy
pathways that require little change. This undermines
academic integrity and weakens the political will to
address the [[climate]] crisis and reduce emissions. And,
of course, it props up Big Polluters’ interests and
continues business as usual.

Some of the world’s most known academic institutions
have deep ties to some of the world’s biggest
polluters, even receiving hundreds of millions of
dollars in funding for [[climate]] or “net zero”-related
[[research]]. Exxon alone, which hasn’t even gone as far
as to publicly commit to reach “net zero”, has formal
relationships with more than 80 academic institutions
around the world.176 Cargill has more than 63 such

such as Exxon, which has contributed US$100 million
to GCEP184—allows corporate sponsors to formally
review [[research]] projects (including academic articles)
before they are completed, and also allows them to be
part of the project development team as affiliates.185
This hardly seems to embody academic integrity and
independence.

Fortunately, more and more scientists are now
speaking out about the big con that “net zero”
represents, 186 187 including 41 scientists that
collectively published a piece debunking myths about
“net zero” targets and offsetting.188

Rather than allowing partnerships with the polluters
driving the [[climate]] crisis, academic institutions should
partner with experts, including movements, on the
frontlines of the [[climate]] crisis. Such partnerships can
advance and improve the viability and accessibility of
real [[climate]] solutions—such as keeping fossil fuels in
the ground and conserving and restoring ecosystems—
to keep global temperature rise to well below 1.5
degrees Celsius.

relationships,177 Chevron178 and Amazon179 180 181 each
around 10, as do many other polluting corporations.
When we take a closer look at what these relationships
look like in just a few of the world’s leading academic
institutions, it’s easy to see the clear impacts these
conflicting relationships have on shaping “net zero”related academic [[research]]. Figures 2-5 break down
some examples of what the impacts of these polluter
partnerships translate into, using Princeton University,
Stanford University, Imperial College London, and
Massachusetts Institute of [[Technology]] (MIT) as
examples. They are far from isolated cases of what
these relationships look like and how they play out.

In some cases, the amount of in[[flu]]ence polluters
have over the [[research]] being produced is astounding.
From [[2002]] to [[2019]], Stanford’s Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP) produced [[research]] on Carbon
Capture and Storage as part of its portfolio.182 183 The

CONCLUSION
The “net zero” plans of Big Polluters are the latest
iteration of the decades-long push by Big Polluters to
find a way to continue to pollute and extract profits
at the expense of people and the planet. “Net zero”
pledges represent Big Polluters’ and Global [[North]]
[[government]]s’ attempts to escape their [[climate]] crimes
by having others serve their sentence.

At the end of the day, “net zero” schemes are Big
Polluters’ reinvigorated attempt to preserve business as
usual and keep profiting. They must not be allowed to
get away with this Big Con.

After decades of denial, it’s no coincidence Big
Polluters are pushing “net zero” into the centre of
[[climate]] action—it provides an avenue for boosting
profits and talking about “[[climate]] action” without even
mentioning a managed fossil fuel decline or decreasing
the production and consumption of emissionsintensive products. On the contrary, many “net zero”
projects are based on making new profits from utilising
and storing carbon, while using that process to make
even more money from further oil exploitation, all
while requiring more energy than the present level.

Perhaps one of the gravest consequences of this era
of corporate-driven [[climate]] commitment around
“net zero” and offset schemes is not what they will
do to the world but the real solutions that they are
preventing from being implemented. According to
the Inter[[government]]al Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC)—the U.N.’s expert body on [[climate]] [[[[science]]]] —the
global community has only less than a decade left to
change the course of [[climate]] change.229 And most of
the groundwork for this change needs to be laid this
year.230

squandered perhaps our final opportunity for the world
to act to drastically decrease emission to the scale
needed and commit to the real solutions that people
from historically exploited communities, [[Indigenous]]
communities, and others have been demanding for
decades. If polluters are successful, people and the
planet will be suffering [[climate]] catastrophe for decades
to come, and we will face the consequences of an
existential crisis.

But that legacy doesn’t have to continue. It can stop
here. And it must.

WE NEED REAL SOLUTIONS AND CLIMATE JUSTICE
The best, most proven approach to justly addressing
the [[climate]] crisis is to significantly reduce emissions
now in an equitable manner, bringing them close to
Real Zero by [[2030]] at the latest.231 The cross-sectoral
solutions we need already exist, are proven, and are
scalable now (see “Real Solutions, Real Zero” in the
resources Box). All that is [[missing]] is the political will
to advance them, in spite of industry obstruction and
deflection.

People around the globe have already made their
demands clear. Meaningful solutions that can be
implemented now are already detailed in platforms
like the People’s Demands for Climate Justice,232 the
Liability Roadmap,233 the Energy Manifesto,234 and many
other resources that encompass the wisdom of those
on the frontlines of the [[climate]] crisis.

Leaders can listen to the people and once and for all
prioritise people’s lives and the planet over engines of
profit and destruction. To avoid social and planetary
collapse, they must heed the calls of millions of people
around the globe and pursue policies that justly,
equitably transition our economies off of fossil fuels
and advance real solutions that prioritize life- now.

If “net zero” plans remain the centre of global [[climate]]
action, this precious time will be wasted on inaction.
And, thanks to Big Polluters, global leaders will have
