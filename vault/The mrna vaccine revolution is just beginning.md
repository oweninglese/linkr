**NO ONE EXPECTED** the first [[Covid]]-19 [[vaccine]] to be as good as it was. “We were hoping for around 70 per cent, that’s a success,” says Dr Ann Falsey, a professor of medicine at the [[University]] of Rochester, New York, who ran a 150-person trial site for the [[Pfizer]]-BioNTech [[vaccine]] in [[2020]].

Even Uğur Şahin, the co-founder and [[[[CEO]]]] of BioNTech, who had shepherded the drug from its earliest stages, had some doubts. All the preliminary laboratory tests looked good; since he saw them in [[June]], he would routinely tell people that “immunologically, this is a near-perfect [[vaccine]].” But that doesn’t always mean it will work against “the beast, the thing out there” in the real world. It wasn’t until [[November]] 9, [[2020]], three months into the final clinical trial, that he finally got the good news. “More than 90 per cent effective,” he says. “I knew this was a game changer. We have a [[vaccine]].”

“We were overjoyed,” Falsey says. “It seemed too good to be true. No respiratory [[vaccine]] has ever had that kind of efficacy.”

The arrival of a [[vaccine]] before the close of the year was an unexpected turn of events. Early in the [[pandemic]], the conventional wisdom was that, even with all the stops pulled, a [[vaccine]] would take at least a year and a half to develop. Talking heads often referenced that the previous fastest-ever [[vaccine]] developed, for mumps back in [[1967]], took four years. Modern [[vaccine]]s often stretch out past a decade of development. BioNTech – and US-based [[Moderna]], which announced similar results later the same week – shattered that conventional timeline.

Neither company was a household name before the [[pandemic]]. In fact, neither had ever had a single drug approved before. But both had long believed that their m[[RNA]] technology, which uses simple genetic instructions as a payload, could outpace traditional [[vaccine]]s, which rely on the often-painstaking assembly of living [[virus]]es or their isolated parts. m[[RNA]] turned out to be a vanishingly rare thing in the world of [[science]] and medicine: a promising and potentially transformative technology that not only survived its first big test, but delivered beyond most people’s wildest expectations.

But its next step could be even bigger. The scope of m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s always went beyond any one disease. Like moving from a vacuum tube to a microchip, the technology promises to perform the same task as traditional [[vaccine]]s, but exponentially faster, and for a fraction of the cost. “You can have an idea in the morning, and a [[vaccine]] prototype by evening. The speed is amazing,” says Daniel Anderson, an m[[RNA]] therapy researcher at MIT. Before the [[pandemic]], charities including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) hoped to turn m[[RNA]] on deadly diseases that the pharmaceutical industry has largely ignored, such as dengue or Lassa fever, while industry saw a chance to speed up the quest for long-held scientific dreams: an improved [[flu]] shot, or the first effective HIV [[vaccine]].

Amesh Adalja, an expert on emerging diseases at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in Maryland, says m[[RNA]] could “make all these applications we were hoping for, pushing for, become part of everyday life.”

“When they write the [[history]] of [[vaccine]]s, this will probably be a turning point,” he adds.

While the world remains focused on the rollout of [[Covid]]-19 [[vaccine]]s, the race for the next generation of m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s – targeted at a variety of other diseases – is already exploding. [[Moderna]] and BioNTech each have nine candidates in development or early clinical trials. There are at least six m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s against [[flu]] in the pipeline, and a similar number against HIV. Nipah, Zika, herpes, dengue, hepatitis and malaria have all been announced. The field sometimes resembles the early stage of a [[gold]] rush, as pharma giants snap up promising researchers for huge contracts – Sanofi recently paid $425 million (£307m) to partner with a small [[American]] m[[RNA]] biotech called Translate Bio, while GSK paid $294 million (£212m) to work with Germany’s CureVac.

“Biotech generally doesn’t have as much disruption as the computer tech industry – development times are long, it's heavily regulated. So you can usually see change coming,” says Hartaj Singh, an industry analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. “[[Covid]] turned that on its head; m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s quickly came out as the big winner. Lots of older [[vaccine]] platforms will be gone – replaced – in a few years, or at least greatly diminished.”

Şahin would go further. “It will be transformative, there's no question. It will be absolutely transformative. Many older [[vaccine]] platforms will not survive.” But, he says, the impact will go beyond what we already know. “There are so many more things we can do. This is not just a replacement; we will be coming up with other new medical innovations that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.”

**NOT EVERYONE WAS** so surprised that m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s passed their first test with flying colours. Katalin Karikó, a Hungarian biochemist, started working with m[[RNA]] as early as [[1989]]; her research at the [[University]] of Pennsylvania in the mid-2000s laid the foundation for both the BioNTech and [[Moderna]] [[vaccine]]s (Karikó now oversees [[RNA]] [[pharmaceuticals]] for BioNTech as a senior vice president). When I ask about her take on the past year, she is characteristically blunt. “There was no nail biting. I expected the [[vaccine]]s to be very potent,” she says.

Even in [[lockdown]], Karikó is one of the nerve centres of the m[[RNA]] world. From her home outside Philadelphia she advises BioNTech’s scientists in Germany, and still works with former academic colleagues at nearby Penn State. She is an inveterate scientist, peppering conversations with references in academic format – name, [[experiment]], year – and constantly looking to the next frontier. She is deeply impressed with the scale of the [[vaccine]] rollout (“the manufacturing, incredible scale, 200 million people injected already”). But she seems almost impatient with how long it took people to come around to her fascination with m[[RNA]]. The [[science]] always said it would “work like a charm”, she says, rattling off small-scale studies from the past two decades.

The concept behind m[[RNA]] as a drug is strikingly simple: it is the molecule that your own cells use to carry instructions from your genes, written in a simple four-letter chemical language. If you can synthesize it in a lab and deliver it to cells, you can theoretically tell them to make a specific tool – a viral antigen, or a cancer-blocking molecule, or more heart tissue – all in their own language. [[Moderna]] has taken to calling m[[RNA]] therapies the “software of life”, or an “operating system” for medicine.

But, like so many other theoretically attractive propositions in [[science]], it was stacked with practical problems. The body violently rejects [[RNA]] from outside sources – probably to avoid being hijacked by [[virus]]es and other pathogens – and often the [[RNA]] proved so toxic that it [[kill]]ed the lab animals it was tested on. “We couldn’t dream of using it on humans,” Karikó says. For years, this was such a major obstacle that few scientists even considered using it for [[vaccine]]s. “It was so theoretical at that time, no-one was really doing this stuff,” Dr David Scales, an assistant professor of medicine at Cornell [[University]] who worked with Karikó as a student, says.

Working with the immunologist Drew Weissman at the [[University]] of Pennsylvania in the early 2000s, Karikó engineered synthetic m[[RNA]] molecules that could avoid the body’s defenses. It was a painstaking process that, Weissman says, [[kill]]ed a lot of mice before they finally found the successful formula. But in [[2004]], one of her constructs worked. In effect, this opened the lines of communication between our cells and m[[RNA]] messages created by scientists.

Karikó always believed m[[RNA]] could do anything. “For years I was going to scientific meetings and approaching people to say, ‘What are you working on? [[May]]be this [[RNA]] technology could help’ – whatever it was, a disease, baldness even. They probably all thought I was crazy,” she says, laughing.

“She was so passionate about the things that [[RNA]] could do,” Scales says. “She was an evangelist and a translator. She helped you think about all the possibilities.”

Nearly 20 years later, the [[vaccine]]s enabled by her work have turned Karikó into a scientific celebrity. That bit, she says, “does make me nervous.” Both [[Moderna]] co-founder Derrick Rossi and the [[British]] biologist Richard Dawkins have suggested she should be considered for the Nobel Prize. This is nice, she says, although the constant requests for interviews encroach on her work. And more important than any plaudits is the fact that thousands of scientists have now come around to her way of thinking.

Unlike the early days of m[[RNA]] research, we won’t be waiting decades for its next big test. The [[pandemic]] has put it in the spotlight, and scientists are eager to find out if its success against [[corona[[virus]]]] can be replicated.

**THE NEXT BIG** m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]] breakthrough probably won’t be against another exotic new disease, but a very familiar one. “Flu is the number one target,” Falsey says. A disease that most people consider under control, in[[flu]]enza still [[kill]]s over 300,000 people worldwide most years. This is despite more than one billion yearly [[flu]] shots. “The [[vaccine]]s aren’t as effective as we want them to be,” she says.

That may be putting it mildly. According to the Centers for [[Disease]] Control and Prevention ([[CDC]]), which tracks the efficacy of the [[vaccine]] in the US every year, they rarely achieve even 50 per cent protection. For the [[2018]]-[[2019]] [[flu]] season it was just 29 per cent; some years it is as low as ten per cent. Scientific papers, not usually prone to expressive language, often refer to an improved [[flu]] [[vaccine]] as the “holy grail” of the field.

One scientist chasing that dream is Norbert Pardi, who works in Katalin Karikó’s old department at the [[University]] of Pennsylvania, where he was recruited by Karikó in [[2011]]. (He is also from [[Hungary]], and proudly shows me a black-and-[[white]] picture of his grandfather alongside Karikó’s father in a small-town butcher shop.) Since the BioNTech results in [[November]], the lab’s phone has been ringing off the hook. “Companies, academics, they wanted to talk. Wanted to know all about these [[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s,” Pardi says. But his main project, stretching back to before the [[corona[[virus]]]] [[pandemic]], targets [[flu]]. “The seasonal [[vaccine]] simply isn’t very good; we can make a better one.”

The problem with current [[flu]] [[vaccine]]s lies in the mismatch between the elusive nature of the in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] and the rather antiquated and slow method we use to make a [[vaccine]] against it – a process m[[RNA]] seems tailor-made to replace. The illness we call [[flu]] is caused by several different species of the in[[flu]]enza [[virus]], and each species is highly mutable (meaning it can change very rapidly). This means a new [[vaccine]] is required each year against the deadliest strains, and even as the [[vaccine]] is being made, the [[virus]] continues mutating. The former head of vaccination for the [[CDC]], Bruce Gellin, calls it a “moving target”, and says a [[vaccine]] that is a good match early in the year might be evaded a few months later.

This would seem to require a rapidly adaptable and changeable [[vaccine]] – and the seasonal [[flu]] [[vaccine]] is not that. The first commercial [[flu]] [[vaccine]] was licensed in the US in [[1945]], and we make it nearly the very same way today. The [[vaccine]] is made by growing the target [[flu]] [[virus]] strains in fertilised hens’ eggs, then purifying it from their [[white]]s – a process just as messy as it sounds. The [[virus]]es are then chemically inactivated, and shot into patients’ arms. The whole thing is slow, taking several months from ID-ing the target strains to growing the eggs to harvesting the [[vaccine]].

Not every [[vaccine]] is made this way – so-called “[[kill]]ed-[[virus]]” [[vaccine]]s are the oldest of the old school. For most pathogens, this approach has long since been supplanted by a technology called recombinant protein [[vaccine]]s, where a single piece of the [[virus]] – a viral protein – is grown in a laboratory. This is what the recently approved Novavax [[vaccine]]s use. If the right target is chosen, just that single piece can prime the [[immune]] system as effectively as a whole [[virus]] – with significantly less mess.

But they have their own downsides. Proteins are complex molecules, and they can be tough to grow in a laboratory. “I spent a lot of time as a biochemist purifying proteins; they can be very complicated, very particular,” Pardi says.

m[[RNA]] does away with all of this. It has sometimes been described in the press as “turning your body into a [[vaccine]] factory”, but that suggests a sort of coercive power. Your body is already a wondrous protein factory. A million times more efficient than any lab on Earth, its cells make trillions of proteins for normal bodily function every single day. An m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]] is just a tiny genetic instruction in the factory’s native language – a work order to add a few little viral proteins to the queue. “Your cells are constantly doing this anyway. We’re just hijacking this process a little to make the viral protein we want the [[immune]] system to recognise,” explains Anna Blakney, an [[RNA]] researcher at the [[University]] of [[British]] Columbia.

This gives m[[RNA]] a massive speed advantage over traditional methods, meaning the [[flu]] [[virus]] would have less time to mutate before a [[vaccine]] arrives. “The lead time to make the [[vaccine]] is so much shorter. You could make a huge batch in two weeks. You could even have multiple different [[flu]] [[vaccine]]s across the winter if it changes in real time,” Blakney says.

“We can get in front of it every season,” says Şahin, who hopes to have BioNTech’s [[flu]] [[vaccine]] in human trials later this year.

A more effective [[flu]] [[vaccine]] would already be a big step, but Pardi and his group are reaching beyond that, trying to create a [[vaccine]] that targets the core, unchangeable structures of the in[[flu]]enza [[virus]]. “A universal [[vaccine]], one shot that would last for years,” he says. Decades of research suggest many likely targets on the in[[flu]]enza [[virus]] for such a [[vaccine]], but targeting multiple sites across multiple in[[flu]]enza strains quickly ramps up the complexity and costs for the traditional approach. Not so with m[[RNA]], says Pardi: “We can easily have 12 or 14 targets in a single shot. Four proteins, and their variants, in multiple strains.”

Pardi’s group and their collaborators already demonstrated good results for a [[vaccine]] in mice. Ferrets are next on the animal-[[testing]] ladder – “hopefully this year,” he says. It’s possible that if their universal [[vaccine]] works out in a few years’ time, it won’t compete with traditional [[flu]] [[vaccine]]s but with the m[[RNA]]-based seasonal [[vaccine]]s that BioNTech and [[Moderna]] are about to test now. “For many years we had to convince people this technology was viable – the world has totally changed in that respect,” he says. Like Karikó, he’s happy to see more scientists piling in. “We like to see that. In the next few years we will learn a lot about how the technology works.”

**INFLUENZA IS AN** obvious target for m[[RNA]], says Dr Lynda Stuart, deputy director for [[vaccine]]s at the Gates Foundation. She expects the platform will “transform [[flu]] [[vaccine]]s”, and that there are many other [[vaccine]]s that it could improve or replace. But beyond that, it could also help with what she calls the “real, hard, intractable problems and diseases”. Because the platform can produce new [[RNA]] so quickly and cheaply, “you don’t have to go through this long process of manufacturing with every idea. It becomes quicker to test them. We can get to new ideas faster.”

Perhaps no [[virus]] has proved harder or more intractable than HIV. “We are nearly 40 years on from the discovery of HIV,” Mark Feinberg, head of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), says, and despite advancements in [[treatment]]s and prophylaxis, a cure is “not close”. There are a thicket of problems. HIV is a long-term infection – hiding quietly inside our cells rather than fighting an immediate, pitched [[battle]] with the [[immune]] system, like [[Covid]]-19 or the [[flu]]. It mutates unbelievably quickly, often creating multiple variants inside a single patient, so it doesn’t have a single, stable target to aim a [[vaccine]] at. One biochemist described the [[corona[[virus]]]] spike protein to me as a “juicy target”, which is why so many different [[vaccine]]s work against it. “A spike gets a very good [[immune]] response. HIV proteins not so much,” Feinberg says.

But scientists believe they have a roadmap to a [[vaccine]]. As Derek Cain, professor at the Human Vaccine Institute at Duke [[University]], explains, a small fraction of people with long-term HIV infections do eventually develop what are called “broadly neutralising [[antibodies]]” against the [[virus]], capable of stopping it before it enters cells. At that point in the disease, he says, those [[antibodies]] are like “a fire extinguisher against a four-alarm house fire.” They can’t reverse the infection on their own. But if a person newly exposed to HIV had the same [[antibodies]], “suddenly it’s a fire extinguisher against a match,” and the infection could be halted.

It is as if those patients’ [[immune]] system is a coach that hit on a winning strategy in the waning minutes of a match, too late to help their own team. But, Cain says, “We can recreate that fight with a series of vaccinations”, by showing an untested [[immune]] system [[vaccine]] snapshots of the same HIV infections that progressed over years in the other patients. It will take lots of trial and error, multiple vaccinations and fine-tuning – what Stuart calls potentially “swarms of [[vaccine]]s, with many targets”.

Using traditional [[vaccine]] methods, this would be a massive war of scientific attrition. Feinberg says that, with protein-based [[vaccine]]s, “the interval between having an idea and getting into a trial could easily be two years.”

“It's hard to fathom having to go through this process for every immunogen, every target,” says Cain. But [[RNA]] can not only be made quicker, because it’s just the chemical signal rather than a protein itself – it also always has the same ingredients. It doesn’t need a new set of lengthy safety tests before going to trial. “You can go from a sequence to getting a [[vaccine]] into the clinic in an unprecedented short time. It would allow us to move much more quickly,” says Feinberg.

Suddenly, the scientific timeline for this incredibly ambitious project is compressed by years – decades even, says Cain. His group is currently collaborating with Pardi and Weissman in Pennsylvania to begin selecting targets, while the IAVI and Gates Foundation are working with [[Moderna]]. “The million dollar question is still whether this will work,” Cain says, but the m[[RNA]] approach could return an answer far sooner than anyone thought possible just a few years ago.

“That scale was unimaginable before. We're at a very exciting point,” says Feinberg.

**THE SAME STORY** is playing out across hundreds of different scientific fields. [[2020]] opened the floodgates. It isn’t just that the [[Covid]]-19 [[vaccine]]s validated m[[RNA]] as a scientific approach; the [[vaccine]] rollout also built up a vast regulatory and manufacturing network for a brand-new technology in under a year. In a sense, [[Covid]] built the infrastructure for the m[[RNA]] future. [[Research]]ers had always promised it would be cleaner and faster than traditional methods, but now [[companies]] are also building the capacity to make billions of doses a year, and it has been tested and found safe in millions of people. “This safety data, the manufacturing scale, it’s all added value that could have taken years to develop,” says Stuart. So many of the barriers that face other blue-sky technologies were swept away by the urgency of the [[pandemic]].

Because of this, the number of new projects is exploding. A recent report from Roots Analysis counted over 150 m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s and other therapies in development. If m[[RNA]] is truly a new era in vaccinology, we will likely know in the very near future, from the sheer number of [[drugs]] going into [[testing]]. BioNTech is working on at least seven new [[vaccine]]s, some “with the same approach as with [[Covid]],” says Şahin. Others, like Tuberculosis and HIV, may be longer hauls. [[Moderna]] has nine [[vaccine]]s in its pipeline. New labs and biotech [[companies]] are also lining up to try their hand, attracted by the growing community and the promise of rapid results.

Ziphius Vaccines, a small Belgian company founded in [[2019]] to focus on m[[RNA]] [[treatment]]s for cancer, pivoted towards infectious disease during the [[pandemic]]. “Nobody believed you could produce a [[vaccine]] so quickly; but suddenly, with the \[m[[RNA]]\] platform, you can get a target within six weeks,” says Mathieu Ghadanfar, the company’s chief medical officer. Ziphius quickly chose ten targets, including dengue, hepatitis and tick-borne encephalitis, and hopes to have pre-clinical results for at least four by the end of [[2022]]. Because of the advances of the past year, larger [[companies]] have the know-how to rapidly scale up promising results coming from a smaller laboratory. “There are all these facilities that can now produce any m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]], and those are here to stay,” says Ghadanfar. “Every day I see a new company getting into m[[RNA]].”

Even the already-streamlined manufacturing process for these [[vaccine]]s may be about to shrink even further – allowing them to be made not just easier, but virtually anywhere. Because its chemical makeup is relatively simple compared to the whole [[virus]]es or living cells we extract for traditional [[vaccine]]s, m[[RNA]] factories need just a fraction of the space. From the size of a “football pitch to a front lawn,” one engineer quipped to me. But there’s no reason they couldn’t get even smaller and simpler. “Like fitting on a desktop, the size of a photocopier. You have your chemicals in a cartridge, and there you go,” says Harris Makatsoris, a professor of sustainable manufacturing systems at [[King]]’s College London.

Makatsoris is working on a prototype to do just that. It’s part of a UK [[government]]-funded project called the Future Vaccine Manufacturing [[Research]] Hub, which was originally intended to find ways for nations in the global south to make their own [[vaccine]]s. That’s still the goal, but after months of nearly every nation on Earth scrambling and fighting over limited supplies, the capacity to make [[vaccine]]s is now a [[government]]al priority. Makatsoris imagines these personal-scale machines used for small-scale operations in hospitals, but in the event of a [[pandemic]], becoming a sort of national [[vaccine]] grid. “With something like 60 machines, you could do the entire population of England,” he says.

Or, pop them in a box and send them wherever they’re needed. “Technically it is quite challenging – but it’s small, it doesn’t involve any hazardous material. It is very transferrable,” says Cleo Kontoravdi, a professor of biosystems engineering at Imperial College. [[Robin]] Shattock at Imperial College, who heads the hub, envisions it in similar terms to the personal computing [[revolution]]. “The lab-in-a-box is the PC, and [[companies]] or labs make software – [[vaccine]]s or other medicines,” he says. As long as you have the hardware, you can run the program anywhere in the world.

**PERHAPS THE MOST** exciting thing about the next few years is that, as Blakney puts it, there are “so many things we don’t yet know” about what exactly this technology can do. The foundational [[RNA]] biologist James Eberwine says that as we learn more about how it functions inside our cells, and how to manipulate that, the more powerful it can become. “The future really is [[RNA]],” he says. “I've been a proponent of that for all this time.”

In the immediate future, the basics of [[RNA]] delivery could be hugely improved. Right now, m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]s work like traditional [[vaccine]]s, shot into a muscle and sucked up by the cells they encounter there. “It’s a very blunt tool,” says Blakney. She focuses on the lipid nano-particle coating, the globule of fat that surrounds the m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]] payload like a soap bubble. “People are finding ways now to change the composition to make it act differently in the body, to target the spleen or target the lungs. We're just starting to understand how to control this system,” she says. Karikó envisions adding new instructions that play on the body’s own signals for shuffling and organising its [[RNA]] – preventing it from being used in certain cell types, or changing the timing and length of its action. This could make delivery more precise, less toxic, and ultimately more effective.

“There are real blue-sky possibilities,” says Stuart. m[[RNA]] creating proteins is the basic template. She suggests the technology could also be used for protein replacement (treating diseases such as cystic fibrosis, where the body makes a vital protein incorrectly) and monoclonal [[antibodies]] (small [[immune]] cells that can target diseased and cancerous cells for destruction). At BioNTech, Şahin has been working on both of these since well before [[Covid]], and he’s also excited about what he calls “[[immune]] engineering”, using m[[RNA]] to deliver instructions for improved versions of the body’s own [[immune]] molecules, topping up its existing defenses to last longer, or recognise invaders better.

All of this is music to Karikó’s ears. The last time I speak to her she is excited about a laboratory that is using m[[RNA]] to try and extend human telomeres – long [[DNA]] caps at the end of our chromosomes that many believe determine the rate of human ageing. She had a similar idea 15 years ago but wasn’t able to pursue it. Now, so much of what she had dreamed of is happening, carried forward by scientists across the world. “When I started this work decades ago, I kept a list of 30 diseases I thought [[RNA]] would be good for,” she says. Telomeres were there, cystic fibrosis, emphysema – all have research programmes dedicated to them now. And there’s still much more to do. “There are 25 left,” she wrote to me, when I asked about progress so far. “So many things are still out there.”
