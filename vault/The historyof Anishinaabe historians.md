In my first years of [[college]], I took a class that focused on the intellectual 
heritage of the [[Western]] world. And as I read those works, I started wondering, 
what [[history]] is there of [[indigenous]] intellectuals in [[North]] [[America]]? I was 
excited to discover that there is actually a fairly long [[history]] of Metis and 
Anishinaabe writers, especially historians.
 
Probably the most famous [[Ojibwe]] historian of the 19th century is William Whipple
[[War]]ren. The son of an [[America]]n [[trade]]r and a mixed-blood [[Ojibwe]] woman (the 
daughter of Michel and Madeline Cadotte, two high profile local figures), he was
born at LaPointe in modern Wisconsin and was educated in several schools out 
east intended for [[Native]] [[America]]n pupils. He is most well-known for his work 
History of the Ojibway People, written in the [[1840]]s and published in [[1885]] after 
his [[death]], in which he synthesized Anishinaabe oral tradition with [[Western]] 
historiographical tradition. Modern Blackfoot/[[Ojibwe]] historian Theresa Schenck 
has edited a version of this work which is a really fascinating look at the 
Dakota-[[Ojibwe]] conflicts of the [[1700]]s and [[1800]]s.
 
Another major figure is Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, the [[child]] of an [[Irish]] fur 
[[trade]]r and an [[Ojibwe]] chief’s daughter, who lived from [[1800]] to [[1842]]. A prominent 
figure in Sault Ste. Marie, she wrote poetry in both English and [[Ojibwe]] along 
with traditional stories learned from her mother, some of which was published in
a local literary magazine. Her work is particularly important to [[America]]n 
literature as a whole because the stories from her mother became the basis for 
Longfellow’s poem “Hiawatha,” Lonfellow having learned them from Jane’s [[America]]n
husband Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. Henry, an early figure in [[America]]n anthropology,
published a number of his wife’s stories in altered form, and she went largely 
unknown for years. An excellent book about her life and writings is available, 
titled The Sound the Stars Make Rushing Through the Sky. More information and 
some of her writings are available on the book’s website[1].
 
A number of early Anishinaabe writers were Christians and missionaries. Peter 
Jones was a Mississauga Methodist preacher in the early 19th century who devoted
his life to spreading the word of Christianity to other [[indigenous]] people. On 
top of his extensive traveling to give speeches advocating assimilation, Jones 
worked on translating the Bible and numerous prayers into [[Ojibwe]], and wrote a 
[[history]] of the [[Ojibwe]] people. George Copway, another Mississauga, converted to 
Methodism along with his parents at an early age and served as a missionary 
until being defrocked for embezzlement. He was briefly a celebrity among the 
East Coast elite for his autobiography and [[history]] of the [[Ojibwe]] people 
published in [[1850]].
 
Although he was Odawa rather than [[Ojibwe]], another significant Anishinaabe writer
was Andrew Blackbird. He attended school for several years, including a stint at
[[Eastern]] Michigan University, and served as a translator and mediator between 
local Odawa and [[Ojibwe]] people and the US [[government]]. In [[1887]] he published a 
[[history]] of the Odawa and [[Ojibwe]] in Michigan[2] as well as a grammar of the 
languages. Another non-[[Ojibwe]] Anishinaabe writer was Simon Pokagon, a Potawatomi
activist who became quite popular among Chicago elites in the late [[1800]]s. His 
work included criticisms of the US [[treatment]] of [[Native]] people along with 
historical accounts of local [[history]]. You can read his “Red Man’s Rebuke[3]” 
online, which he distributed at the [[1893]] Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition.
 
Those are just a few of the historical writers that I know of. Anishinaabe 
people were some of the earliest [[Native]] people to produce English works, likely 
because of their longtime contact with fur [[trade]]rs and officials. They were 
significant for producing [[indigenous]] perspectives on [[history]] early on. Modern 
Anishinaabe writers such as Anton Treuer, Patty Loew, Erik M. Redix, and Theresa
Schenck (among many others) are today continuing to push the boundaries of 
[[indigenous]] [[history]] by challenging the biases and methods of historiography and 
choosing to indigenize them in various ways. In doing so, they are drawing on a 
long tradition of Anishinaabe historians that came before them.
