### Quote from the following article:

> #### **#10 [[SARS-CoV-2]] the Theoretical Virus: Previous Corona[[virus]]es Have Not Been Isolated**
> 
> #### The [[[[Spanish]]]] [[health]] journal _Salud_ published a great article in [[[[November]] [[2020]]]] entitled “Frauds and falsehoods in the medical field” where it exposes the lack of evidence not only for the isolation of [[SARS-CoV-2]], but also for the isolation of other past [[corona[[virus]]]]es (unofficial translation [here]). The scam runs deep. [[Jon Rappoport]] has done great work exposing how the exact same scam blueprint was played out in the [[1980]]s (with [[[[Fauci]]]] in charge, leading the fraud) when scientists asserted there was a new [[virus]] called [[HIV]], and it was causing [[AIDS]]. The [[[[COVID]]]] #scamdemic greatly mimics other #historical #fake #[[pandemic]]s such as the [[[1976]] swine [[flu]] [[pandemic]]]. The article is _Salud_ states:
> 
> #### _“The [[genetic sequences]] used in [[PCRs]] to detect suspected [[SARS-CoV-2]] and to diagnose cases of illness and [[death]] attributed to [[[[COVID]]-19]] are present in dozens of sequences of the [[human genome]] itself and in those of about a hundred [[[[microbes]]]]. And that includes the [[initiators]] or [[primers]], the most extensive fragments taken at random from their supposed “[[genome]]” and even the so-called “[[target genes]]” allegedly specific to the “new [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]]”. The test is worthless and all “positive” results obtained so far should be scientifically #invalidated and communicated to those affected; and if they are deceased, to their relatives. Stephen Bustin, one of the world’s leading experts on #PCR, in fact says that under certain conditions anyone can test positive!_
> 
> #### _…_
> 
> #### _We have been warning you since [[March]]: you cannot have specific tests for a #[[virus]] without knowing the components of the #[[virus]] you are trying to detect. And the components cannot be known without having previously isolated/purified that [[virus]]. Since then we continue to accumulate evidence that no one has isolated #SARS-CoV-2 and, more importantly, that it can never be isolated … In this report we are going to add the results of a particular [[research]] we have done from the data published on the alleged SARS-CoV-2 and on the protocols endorsed by the #WHO for the use of RT-PCR as well as the data corresponding to the rest of the “human [[corona[[virus]]]]es”. And the conclusions are extremely serious: none of the seven “human #[[corona[[virus]]]]es” have actually been isolated and all the #sequences of the #primers of their respective #PCRs as well as those of a large number of fragments of their supposed #genomes are found in different areas of the human #genome and in #genomes of #bacteria and #archaea …”_

#### I will keep posting this information until this massive lie and [[crime against humanity]] has been torn down and burned!

#### Please read the following article carefully, and find out what the real truth is about “sars-cov-2” and “[[[[COVID]]-19]]”:

#### \*\*\*

#### _The Imaginary and Theoretical Virus known as [[SARS-CoV-2]], a concept which has been used by the [[NWO]] ([[[[New]] World Order]]) controllers to shut down the world, is becoming more and more exposed as the months go by._

#### _Although those who believe in the **[[[[COVID]]]] cult** – both those orchestrating the scamdemic and those blindly following along – will insist the #[[virus]] is real, the truth is that there has still been no compelling or conclusive evidence that a real #SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]] exists._

#### _Admissions by [[government]]al scientists and organizations worldwide, as well as omissions and obfuscations by those same people and agencies, reveal the shocking truth. As hard as it may be for the **[[COVID]] cultists** to admit, the emperor truly has no clothes._

#### _**There is no [[virus]]**, other than a digital, theoretical abstraction made on a [[computer]] from a #genomic #[[database]]. **The [[virus]] has never been #isolated, #purified, #sequenced, #characterized and proven 100% to exist.**_

#### _Don’t believe it? That’s okay; it’s good to be skeptical. See the evidence below for yourself and make up your own mind._

#### **#1 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: The Virus Has Never Been Isolated According to [[Koch’s Postulates]] or [[River’s Postulates]]**

#### We’ll start with this, because this is the [[corn]]erstone of the whole scam. All the following information and evidence below stems from the fact the so-called experts have never isolated and purified the [[virus]] according to the [[gold]] standard of [Koch’s postulates], or even the modified [[River’s Postulates.]]  [[Koch’s postulates]] are:

1.  #### The [[microorganism]] must be identified in all individuals affected by the disease, but not in [[health]]y individuals.
    
2.  #### The #microorganism can be isolated from the diseased individual and grown in culture.
    
3.  #### When introduced into a [[health]]y individual, the cultured microorganism must cause disease.
    
4.  #### The microorganism must then be re-isolated from the experi[[mental]] host, and found to be identical to the original microorganism.
    

#### [River’s postulates] were proposed by **Thomas M. River** in [[1973]] to establish the role of a specific [[virus]] as the cause of a specific disease. They are modifications of Koch’s postulates. They are as follows:

1.  #### The [[viral]] agent must be found either in the host’s (animal or plant) body [[flu]]ids at the time of disease or in cells showing lesions specific to that disease.
    
2.  #### The host material with the [[[[viral]] agent]] used to inoculate the [[health]]y host (test organism) must be free of any other microorganism.
    
3.  #### The [[viral]] agent obtained from the infected host must produce the specific disease in a suitable [[health]]y host, and/or provide evidence of infection by inducing the formation of [[[[antibodies]]]] specific to that agent.
    
4.  #### Similar material ([[viral]] particle) from the newly infected host (test organism) must be isolated and capable of transmitting the specific disease to other [[health]]y hosts.
    

#### Whichever set of postulates is used, SARS-CoV-2 fails the test. **Dr. Andrew Kaufman** does a great job explaining why in this [video]. The [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] SARS-CoV-2 (allegedly causing the disease [[[[COVID]]-19]]) has not been shown to be present only in sick people and not in [[health]]y ones.

#### **The [[virus]] has never been isolated, which must be done with proper equipment such as [[electron microscopes]]** and which cannot be achieved through CT scans (as the [[Chinese]] were using) and the flawed RT-PCR test.

#### The [[January]] 24th [[2020]] study published in the _[[New]] England Journal of Medicine_ entitled [_A Novel [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] from Patients with Pneumonia in [[China]], [[2019]]_](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa[[2001]]017) describes how the scientists arrived at the idea of [[[[COVID]]-19]]: they took lung [[flu]]id samples and extracted [[RNA]] from them using the [[PCR]] test. It admits that the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] failed Koch’s postulates:

#### _“Further development of accurate and rapid methods to identify unknown respiratory pathogens is still needed … our study does not fulfill Koch’s postulates.”_

#### **#2 [[SARS-CoV-2]] the Theoretical Virus: Top [[Chinese]] Scientist Admitted They Never Isolated the Virus**

#### All claims that the SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]] has been isolated have turned out to be unsubstantiated. Meanwhile, there have been actual admissions by officials that they haven’t isolated it. The chief [[epidemiologist]] of the [[[[Chinese]] [[CDC]]]] (Center for Disease Control) admitted _“they didn’t isolate the [[virus]]”_ in this [video clip].

#### **#3 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[CDC]] Stated No Quantified Isolate Was Available**

#### The US [[CDC]] (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in its [[July]] [[2020]] report [_[[CDC]] [[2019]]-Novel Corona[[virus]] ([[2019]]-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel_] admits that it had been **running PCR tests based not on an actual [[viral]] isolate (an actual sample or specimen taken from an infected human), but rather _“stocks”_ of _“transcribed [[RNA]]”_ taken from a gene bank to _“mimic clinical specimen”_:**

#### _“Since no quantified [[virus]] isolates of the [[2019]]-nCoV were available for [[CDC]] use at the time the test was developed and this study conducted, assays designed for detection of the [[2019]]-nCoV [[RNA]] were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length [[RNA]] (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer ([[RNA]] copies/μL) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and [[viral]] transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.” (pg.43)_

#### **#4 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[CDC]] Admitted They Made a Digital Virus of 30,000 Base Pairs Using 37 Actual Sample Base Pairs**

#### As covered in my previous article [_SARS-CoV-2: The Stitched Together, Frankenstein Virus_], the [[CDC]] has already admitted that SARS-CoV-2 is a [[computer]]-generated digital [[virus]], not a real living [[virus]]. As I wrote:

#### _“In other words, it is a Frankenstein [[virus]] which has been concocted and stitched together using genomic [[database]] sequences (some [[viral]], some not). It has never been properly purified and isolated so that it could be sequenced from end-to-end once derived from living tissue; instead, it’s just digitally assembled from a [[computer]] [[database]]. In this paper, the [[CDC]] scientists state they took just 37 base pairs from a genome of 30,000 base pairs which means that about 0.001% of the [[viral]] sequence is derived from actual living samples or real bodily tissue. In other words, they took these 37 segments and put them into a [[computer]] program, which filled in the rest of the base pairs. This [[computer]]-generation step constitutes scientific fraud.”_

#### In this article [_In [[June]] Study [[CDC]] Scientists Make 2 [[COVID]] Admissions that Destroy Official Narrative_] I reveal how the [[CDC]] admitted in their [paper] that they extrapolated their make-believe [[virus]]. Here is the quote:

#### _“Whole-Genome Sequencing_

#### _We designed 37 pairs of nested PCRs spanning the genome on the basis of the [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] reference sequence (GenBank accession no. NC045512). We extracted nucleic acid from isolates and amplified by using the 37 individual nested PCRs.”_

#### Another way to say this is that the “[[virus]]” has been constructed using a technique called **de novo assembly** which is a method for constructing genomes from a large number of (short or long) [[DNA]] fragments, with no _a priori_ knowledge of the correct sequence or order of those fragments. You can read more about it [here].

#### **#5 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[Europe]]an Corman-Drosten Paper Used an “In Silico” Genome of an “In Silico” Virus**

#### The original [Corman-Drosten paper] **admits they used a theoretical [[virus]] sequence for all their work and calculations. They, like the [[CDC]] and every [[government]] and agency, claim this is only because no isolate was ever available**. I wonder if any of these scientists every asked WHY the isolate has never been available?

#### _“In the present case of [[2019]]-nCoV, [[virus]] isolates or samples from infected patients have so far not become available to the international public [[health]] community.”_

#### A subsequent study highlighting fatal flaws in the Corman-Drosten paper was published entitled [_External peer review of the RTPCR test to detect SARS-CoV-2 reveals 10 major scientific flaws at the molecular and methodological level: consequences for false positive results_]. It highlights how the authors used **in silico** or theoretical sequences from [[computer]] banks, not real isolated samples from infected people. “In silico” is pseudo-Latin for “theoretical”; in plain English, synonyms for theoretical are “imaginary” and “make-believe.”

#### _“The first and major issue is that the novel Corona[[virus]] SARS-CoV-2 (in the publication named [[2019]]\-nCoV and in [[February]] [[2020]] named SARS-CoV-2 by an international consortium of [[virus]] experts) is based on in silico (theoretical) sequences, supplied by a laboratory in [[China]], because at the time neither control material of infectious (“live”) or inactivated SARS\-CoV-2 nor isolated genomic [[RNA]] of the [[virus]] was available to the authors. To date no validation has been performed by the authorship based on isolated SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]]es or full length [[RNA]] thereof._

#### _…_

#### _Nevertheless **these in silico sequences were used to develop a RT-PCR test methodology to identify the aforesaid [[virus]]. This model was based on the assumption that the novel [[virus]] is very similar to SARS-CoV from [[2003]]** (Hereafter named SARS-CoV-1) as both are beta-[[corona[[virus]]]]es … in short, **a design relying merely on close genetic relatives does not fulfill the aim for a “robust diagnostic test” as cross reactivity and therefore false-positive results will inevitably occur.** Validation was only done in regards to in silico(theoretical) sequences and within the laboratory-setting, and not as required for in-vitro diagnostics with isolated genomic [[viral]] [[RNA]]. This very fact hasn’t changed even after 10 months of introduction of the test into routine diagnostics.” (__emphasis added)_

#### **#6 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[UK]] Government Couldn’t Produce Evidence**

#### The [[government]]s of many nations around the world couldn’t seem to come up with a real [[virus]] either when challenged to do so. More evidence proving the “[[virus]]” is constructed on a [[computer]] [[database]] from a digital gene bank comes from [[[France]]s Leader], who questioned the [[UK]] MHRA (Medicines and [[Healthcare]] products Regulatory Agency) whether a real isolated [[virus]] was used to make the [[COVID]] [[vaccine]]. Leader found that the WHO protocols that [[Pfizer]] used to produce the m[[RNA]] do not appear to identify any nucleotide sequences that are unique to the SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]]. Leader asked if the “[[virus]]” was actually a [[computer]] generated genomic sequence, and ultimately the MHRA confirmed they had no real specimen:

#### _“The [[DNA]] template does not come directly from an isolated [[virus]] from an infected person.”_

#### In [[July]] [[2020]], a group of concerned academics [wrote a letter] to the [[UK]] Prime Minister Boris Johnson in which they asked him to produce independently peer reviewed scientific evidence proving that the SARS-CoV-2 “[[virus]]” has been isolated. To date they have not received a reply. Similarly, [[UK]] [[research]]er [Andrew Johnson] made a Freedom of Information Request to Public Health England (PHE). He asked them to provide him with their records describing the isolation of a SARS-COV-2 [[virus]] to which [they responded]:

> #### _“PHE can confirm it does not hold information in the way suggested by your request.”_

#### **#7 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[Australia]]n Government Couldn’t Produce Evidence**

#### In other Commonwealth nations it’s the exact same story. In [[Australia]] scientists from the [Doherty Institute] falsely announced that they had [isolated the SARS-CoV-2 [[virus]]]. When asked to clarify the scientists said:

> #### _“We have short ([[RNA]]) sequences from the diagnostic test that can be used in the diagnostic tests.”_

#### Perhaps this is the reason for this disclaimer by the [[[Australia]]n Government]:

> #### _“The reliability of [[[[COVID]]-19]] tests is uncertain due to the limited evidence base…There is limited evidence available to assess the accuracy and clinical utility of available [[COVID]]-19 tests.”_

#### **#8 SARS-CoV-2 the Theoretical Virus: [[Canadian]] Government Couldn’t Produce Evidence**

#### [[Research]]er **Christine Massey** made a similar Freedom Of Information request in [[Canada]], to which the [[[Canadian]] Government replied]:

#### _“Having completed a thorough search, we regret to inform you that we were unable to locate any records responsive to your request.”_

#### \[The complete letter from [Health [[Canada]] / Santé [[Canada]] is on file]\]

#### **#9 SARS-Cov-2 the Theoretical Virus: Over 40 Institutions Worldwide Can’t Answer the Basic Question**

#### In fact, **Christine Massey** and her colleague in [[New]] [[Zealand]]

#### _“have been submitting Freedom of Information requests to various institutions in [[[[Canada]]]], [[NZ]], [[[[Australia]]]], [[Germany]], the [[[[U.K.]]]], the [[U.S.]] etc., seeking any records that describe the isolation of a “[[[[COVID]]-19] ][[virus]]” (aka “[[SARS-CoV-2]]”) from an unadulterated sample taken from a diseased human … As of [[December]] 16, [[2020]], >40 institutions in [[Canada]], [[U.S.]], [[New]] [[Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[U.K.]], England, [[Scotland]], Wales, [[Ireland]], [[Denmark]], and the [[Europe]]an [[CDC]] have provided their responses, and none could locate any record describing the isolation of any “[[[[COVID]]-19]] [[virus]]” aka “SARS-COV-2” directly from a diseased patient.”_

#### Massey posts their replies [here] and [here].

#### **#10 SARS-Cov-2 the Theoretical Virus: Previous Corona[[virus]]es Have Not Been Isolated**

#### The [[[[Spanish]]]] [[health]] journal _Salud_ published a great article in [[November]] [[2020]] entitled “Frauds and falsehoods in the medical field” where it exposes the lack of evidence not only for the isolation of SARS-CoV-2, but also for the isolation of other past [[corona[[virus]]]]es (unofficial translation [here]). The scam runs deep. Jon Rappoport has done great work exposing how the exact same scam blueprint was played out in the [[1980]]s (with [[Fauci]] in charge, leading the fraud) when scientists asserted there was a new [[virus]] called HIV, and it was causing AIDS. The [[COVID]] scamdemic greatly mimics other historical fake [[pandemic]]s such as the [[[1976]] swine [[flu]] [[pandemic]]]. The article is _Salud_ states:

> #### _“The genetic sequences used in PCRs to detect suspected SARS-CoV-2 and to diagnose cases of illness and [[death]] attributed to [[[[COVID]]-19]] are present in dozens of sequences of the human genome itself and in those of about a hundred [[microbes]]. And that includes the initiators or primers, the most extensive fragments taken at random from their supposed “genome” and even the so-called “target genes” allegedly specific to the “new [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]]”. The test is worthless and all “positive” results obtained so far should be scientifically invalidated and communicated to those affected; and if they are deceased, to their relatives. Stephen Bustin, one of the world’s leading experts on PCR, in fact says that under certain conditions anyone can test positive!_

#### Their report analyzed human [[corona[[virus]]]]es 229E (said to have been isolated in [[1965]]), OC43 (in [[1967]]), SARS-CoV (in [[2003]]), NL63 (in [[2004]]), HKU1 (in [[2005]]) and MERS-CoV (in [[2012]]). And just to repeat in case you missed it: they discovered the **alleged sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are found in both humans and bacteria!** This means all the various in silico models of SARS-CoV-2 contain existing human genetic sequences, **so it is little wonder that people test positive when the primer or standard being tested against contains human sequences.**

#### **Conclusion: The [[COVID]] Cult is a Colossal Fraud and Superstition**

#### How did this all start? [[Chinese]] scientists took lung [[flu]]id samples and claimed they had discovered a novel or new [[virus]]. The Gates-Rockefeller WHO backed them up. In the WHO’s [Novel Corona[[virus]] [[2019]]-nCov Situation Report 1], they state:

> #### _“The [[[[Chinese]]]] authorities identified a new type of [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]], which was isolated on [[7 [[January]] [[2020]]]]……On [[12 [[January]] [[2020]]]], [[[[China]]]] shared the #genetic #sequence of the #novel [[[[corona[[virus]]]]]] for countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits.”_

#### With the evidence presented above, the WHO’s assertions and claims are utterly baseless. They constitute outright fraud.

#### The world has been shut down over a lie – a coldly calculated, carefully curated lie – that was simulated and war-gamed for decades in advance. The [[COVID]] cult is an irrational superstition based on nothing but in silico, theoretical, make-believe [[viral]] sequences. Yet, the real-world consequences for millions who have been thrown into stress, despair, [[poverty]], joblessness, alcoholism and suicide is anything but theoretical.
