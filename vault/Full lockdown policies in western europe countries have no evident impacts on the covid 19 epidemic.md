# Full lockdown policies in Western Europe countries have no evident impacts on the COVID-19 epidemic | medRxiv

> ## Excerpt
> This phenomenological study assesses the impacts of full lockdown strategies applied in Italy, France, Spain and United Kingdom, on the slowdown of the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Comparing the trajectory of the epidemic before and after the lockdown, we find no evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate, doubling time, and reproduction number trends. Extrapolating pre-lockdown growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the death toll in the absence of any lockdown policies, and show that these strategies might not have saved any life in western Europe. We also show that neighboring countries applying less restrictive social distancing measures (as opposed to police-enforced home containment) experience a very similar time evolution of the epidemic.

## Abstract

This phenomenological study assesses the impacts of full [[lockdown]] strategies applied in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[United]] [[King]]dom, on the slowdown of the [[2020]] [[COVID]]-19 outbreak. Comparing the trajectory of the [[epidemic]] before and after the [[lockdown]], we find no evidence of any discontinuity in the growth rate, doubling time, and reproduction number trends. Extrapolating pre-[[lockdown]] growth rate trends, we provide estimates of the [[death]] toll in the absence of any [[lockdown]] policies, and show that these strategies might not have saved any life in western [[Europe]]. We also show that neighboring countries applying less restrictive social distancing measures (as opposed to police-enforced home containment) experience a very similar time evolution of the [[epidemic]].
