"For you may rely upon it that nothing

can give greater comfort to a husband
than the satisfaction of having a wife
who is nearly mute."7 Women were also
expected to be pious, a trait that further

encouraged their submissiveness.
The behavior of the wives of laborers

came under particular scrutiny at this

time because working-class women

and [[Indian]]s were considered inher-

ently sexual. The common belief was
that they were capable of being virtuous
only if their activities were strictly regu-

lated. Consequently, Victorian society
exaggerated the importance of chastity

and virtue. A woman's chastity, and
hence her body, was not her own to con-

trol but the [[property]] of her father and
then her husband. The adherence of
women to the behaviors that identified
middle-class [[British]] women became of

primary importance in defining the
family's social status. Consequently, the
wives of laborers within the Hudson's

The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company established Fort Nisqually as a fur-trading post in
[[1833]]. In [[1840]]-41 the [[company]] transferred the fort to the Puget Sound Agricultural
Company, which moved the post in [[1843]]. This map shows the two locations of the
