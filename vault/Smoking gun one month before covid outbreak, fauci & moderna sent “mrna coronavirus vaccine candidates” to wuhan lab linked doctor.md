**[Documents show](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6935295-[[NIH]]-[[Moderna]]-Confidential-Agreements.html) Anthony [[Fauci]]’s [[NIH]] and pharma giant [[Moderna]] shared “m[[RNA]] Corona[[virus]] Vaccine Candidates” with an expert who [mentored the [[Wuhan]] bat lady](https://www.infowars.com/posts/remdesivir-creator-mentored-wuhan-lab-virologist/) and “[helped test the [[COVID]] [[vaccine]]](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/technology/bat-cave-search-covids-origins-scientists-reignite-polarizing-debate-wuhan-lab-leak)” over a month before [[COVID]]-19 was identified.**

Originally posted by _[Axios](https://www.axios.com/moderna-nih-[[corona[[virus]]]]-[[vaccine]]-ownership-agreements-22051c42-2dee-4b19-938d-099afd71f6a0.html)_ last year, documents reveal the U.S. [[government]] and [[Moderna]] teamed up to send material transfer agreements to top specialists just days before [[COVID]]-19 was [[leaked]] in [[Wuhan]], [[China]].

The transfer agreement was signed by multiple parties between [[December]] 12th and 19th of [[2019]].

According to the official narrative, the World Health Organization (WHO) became aware of a pneumonia outbreak in the city of [[Wuhan]] on [[December]] 31, [[2019]].

Not until [[January]] 9, [[2020]] did [WHO release an official statement](https://www.who.int/china/news/detail/09-01-[[2020]]-who-statement-regarding-cluster-of-pneumonia-cases-in-wuhan-china) regarding the novel [[corona[[virus]]]] found in a hospital patient in [[Wuhan]].

One of the signees of the transfer agreement, Dr. Ralph Baric of UNC Chapel Hill, has extremely close ties with the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology.

In the material transfer form, [[Fauci]] and [[Moderna]] ask Baric to “perform challenge studies with the m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]] in a (redacted) model as described on Exhibit A.”

However, “Exhibit A” is also redacted in the document.

Dr. Shi Zhengli, infamously known as the [[Wuhan]] [“Bat Woman](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/world/asia/china-covid-wuhan-lab-leak.html),” was a [lead researcher alongside Baric](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985) until she left the UNC-Chapel Hill lab for the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology.

In fact, Zhengli and Baric published a paper in [[2015]] describing, “A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat [[corona[[virus]]]]es shows potential for human emergence.”

How would they know the cluster specifically associated with the [[Chinese]] horseshoe bat shows potential for human emergence?

Well, [in their own words](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985), they “built a chimeric by encoding a novel, zoonotic CoV spike protein—from the RsSHC014-CoV sequence that was isolated from [[Chinese]] horseshoe bats.”

Next, researchers **purposely infected human lungs** “for HAE cultures” that “were procured under [[University]] of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board–approved protocols.”

While “gain-of-function” research [was banned in America in [[2014]]](https://www.nature.com/articles/514411a), the [[2015]] Baric/Zhengli paper admits, “Continuation of these studies was requested, and this has been approved by the [[NIH]].”

Interestingly, a note at the end of the research paper explains the authors originally omitted the fact that EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) funded their work.

EHA is the same group [[Fauci]]’s [[NIH]] used to funnel money to the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology where Baric’s co-worker Dr. Shi Zhengli is the lab director.

EHA’s president, Peter Daszak, was also the only [[American]] sent to [[Wuhan]] to “investigate” the lab leak theory, which he unsurprisingly dismissed.

 [![Learn more about RevenueStripe...](https://stripe.rs-stripe.com/branding/recommend/web.png)](https://stripe.rs-stripe.com/branding/?utm_source=contentstripe&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=rs_122212&utm_content=logo&rs_type=web) 

[![](https://stripe.rs-stripe.com/stripe/image?cs_email={{GUID}}&cs_stripeid=122212&cs_offset=0&cs_containertype=web&cs_esp=powerinbox_web)](https://stripe.rs-stripe.com/stripe/redirect?cs_email={{GUID}}&cs_stripeid=122212&cs_offset=0&cs_containertype=web&cs_esp=powerinbox_web)

In fact, as lead investigator for the WHO investigation, Daszak [determined within 3 hours of visiting the [[Wuhan]] lab](https://summit.news/2021/02/09/who-absolves-china-of-blame-for-covid-after-visiting-[[virus]]-lab-for-just-3-hours/) in [[February]] 2021 that there was “nothing to see here.”

With Daszak’s obvious conflict of interest regarding the [[Wuhan]] lab and gain-of-function research now making headlines, he was just [recused from his position](https://www.infowars.com/posts/finally-daszak-is-fired-from-commission-investigating-covid-origins/) as head investigator looking into [[COVID]] origins for the medical journal _The Lancet_.

After Dr. Ralph Baric [[experiment]]ed with gain-of-function research, he created the [[corona[[virus]]]] [[treatment]] drug [Remdesivir for pharma giant Gilead](https://uncnews.unc.edu/[[2020]]/04/29/positive-remdesivir-clinical-trial-results-from-carolina-innovation/), a company that has received over $6.5 billion from [[Fauci]]’s [[NIH]] in the past few years.

Now, [Baric has teamed up with scientists](https://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/new-universal-[[vaccine]]-effectively-targets-[[corona[[virus]]]]es/) to create another money-maker in what they call a “universal [[vaccine]]” that targets [[corona[[virus]]]]es.

“The [[vaccine]] has the potential to prevent outbreaks when used as a new variant is detected,” said Baric.

“With this strategy, perhaps we can prevent a SARS-CoV-3,” a co-creator of the universal [[vaccine]] ominously stated.

In [[2018]], Baric spoke at a conference on the 100-year anniversary of the [[1918]] [[Spanish]] Flu Pandemic and explained one day somebody could sell [[vaccine]]s to people who want to vaccinate themselves at home.

“Most likely, somebody will come up with a way to sell that in a legal way, not a safe way,” he said.

Could the “universal” [[corona[[virus]]]] [[vaccine]] he just helped create be marketed for at-home use?

Baric even detailed how one could hypothetically “make money in the next [[pandemic]],” providing a “global catastrophe opportunities” chart.

Another entity that would like to keep the origins of [[COVID]]-19 a secret is the [[Chinese]] military, [which was on the record conducting secret research](https://www.infowars.com/posts/wa-post-admits-chinese-military-involved-in-wuhan-lab/) at the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology.

[A new report by _the_ _[[Washington]] Post_](https://www.businessinsider.com/wapo-corrects-article-describing-wuhan-lab-leak-claim-as-conspiracy-theory-2021-6), an outlet that previously denied the lab leak theory, [acknowledges](https://www.infowars.com/posts/wa-post-admits-chinese-military-involved-in-wuhan-lab/) classified military research was carried out at the lab and that records will almost certainly remain sealed by the [[Chinese]] [[government]] for two decades.

“The secrecy may help to explain why efforts to confirm or disprove the lab-leak theory of the [[pandemic]]’s origins have made little progress,” the report admits.

[As Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) recently asked](https://www.infowars.com/posts/video-rep-mo-brooks-destroys-media-defending-chinese-communist-party-during-fire-fauci-press-conference/), why would a group of scientists intentionally take dangerous [[virus]]es that don’t harm humans and alter them in order to do so if not for military purposes?

By the way… if anyone was wondering why the internet overlords are censoring the lab leak theory, it could be the fact that [[[Google]] has been funding EcoHealth Alliance for over a decade.](https://www.infowars.com/posts/google-funded-[[virus]]-research-by-wuhan-lab-linked-scientist/)
