# Daniel Ellsberg: The 90-year-old [[whistleblower]] tempting prosecution

Ellsberg's job, at the time he copied the [[Pentagon Papers]], was [[[[nuclear]] strategy]]. His recent book _The Doomsday Machine_ is a sobering account of early US strategy, which he can write about now because a lot has been declassified.

It turns out the [[Pentagon Papers]] were supposed to be just a sideline. He also copied documents on US [[nuclear]] strategy, which was horrific. He released the [[Vietnam]] documents first because he figured if he started with the [[nuclear]] docs, nobody would care about the [[[[Vietnam]]]] stuff.

He gave the [[nuclear]] papers to his brother to hide. His brother hid them first in his compost pile, then got worried and moved them to a garbage bag on the edge of the town dump. The next day, men in suits were seen poking metal rods in his compost pile.

Unfortunately, a freak storm washed away that section of the dump. Ellsberg and his brother spent a year opening garbage bags in the area where it all ended up, to no avail. Ellsberg said his wife considered the storm a gift from God, because if the [[nuclear]] papers had hit the light of day, he surely would have spent the rest of his life in [[prison]].

The recent revelations are not at all surprising.

Truman relieved General MacArthur of his command over coalition forces in [[[[Korea]]]] in large part because he planned and aggressively advocated the use of [[nuclear]] weapons against the [[Chinese]].

If you visit the Princeton stacks, you can unearth many Woodrow Wilson School theses advocating the aggressive use of [[nuclear]] weapons during [[Vietnam]]. Some of the people who authored these papers went on to craft US [[trade]] policy from the [[1980]]s through the present. A truly remarkable change of heart.

\> Truman relieved General MacArthur of his command over coalition forces in [[[[Korea]]]] in large part because he planned and aggressively advocated the use of [[nuclear]] weapons against the [[Chinese]].

This is still debated, and MacArthur later denied it in his testimony to the Senate Inquiry. His removal has a clearer and simpler reason: Truman felt MacArther's communication with the [[Chinese]] violated his [[December]] directive and preempted the [[President]], while the Joint Chiefs' concern was that "if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military." \[1\]

The simplest explanation for the removal is that MacArthur tacitly disobeyed the Commander-in-Chief (enraging [[President]] Truman).

It also adds information. Specifically, that it wasn’t the lack of awareness that led to this situation repeating. This, we should focus our efforts not just on whistleblowing, but on figuring out the gap between the whistle and effective action.

MacArthur was the wack job who, along with Patton and Eisenhower, attacked the poor Bonus Army [[protest]]ors during the [[Great]] Depression. It's pretty much analogous to Occupy Wall Street but with a specific goal.

The Bonus Army was seen as a major threat at the time (imagine the Capital Building [[[[protest]]s]], but large enough to occupy a large part of the capital). FDR's commencement speech, which took place while they were going on, makes anything said by recent US presidents look tame.

If you want to learn more, just watch the movie Dr. Strangelove. It was marketed as a comedy, but people in the know consider it to be non-fiction:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr.\_Strangelove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove)

General MacArthur was dismissed during the [[[[Korea]]]]n [[War]] because the White House weren't sure if he was going to use nukes or not (like the movie.) The policy was that the US was ready ([[bomb]]ers with nukes were positioned in Japan), but [[President]] Truman wanted to give final advance approval to commanders, yet MacArthur was issuing his own policy.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas\_MacArthur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_MacArthur)

(It turns out that MacArthur was right about basically everything he ever said, and continued to advise [[President]]s.)

There's a graph, 2/3 down the article. It shows how the [[Obama]] admin went after [[whistleblower]]s, charging more with espionage than every previous PotUS.

Having that acknowledged (if not really addressed) in the article, feels like a tiny bit of press-progress. It's some improvement over [[2009]]-[[2016]], where [[Obama]]'s [[War]] On Whistleblowers was covered as minimally as possible (eg: almost entirely ignored).

The principle in play here: If voters and news orgs fail to hold a reasonable PotUS accountable, it's a gift of power to the unreasonable ones that follow.

So he's tempting prosecution because a [[NYT]] story last month referenced a disclosure he made four years ago from a fifty year old study he copied forty years ago.

While I like to see the press remind the public that [[whistleblower]]s are often not given the pretense of a fair trial, I don't see anything supporting the headline's claim that he's tempting prosecution.

\> Now Ellsberg, who recently turned 90, is calling on the U.S. [[government]] to prosecute him under the [[1917]] Espionage Act.

\> The [[government]], Ellsberg plausibly believes, “is not anxious” to prosecute him. But he hopes to force the issue, in an attempt to bring the case to the Supreme Court and have the Espionage Act declared unconstitutional — a long-held goal of First Amendment advocates.

"Wants prosecution" seems like a much more accurate headline. "Tempts" makes it seem like the US is considering it, and that they haven't for the four years since the release shows they're unlikely to.

Thank you. I have learned more about the word, tempt. It can be a verb with an object or a verb without an object. Therefore, either use is correct, but the meaning differs slightly betweem them. I can _tempt you_ with cake, but in return you might not be tempted by the cake.

I don't understand what the positive outcome of this is. If [[China]] invades [[Taiwan]] they'll be able to hold the rest of the world hostage because of TSMC. It's still a lose-lose situation.

I'll give you some food for thought.

During [[WW2]] Allies [[bomb]]ed 3rd reich's weapon factories, and occupied [[French]] cities. A lot of civilians died, really a lot.

Do you think semi-enslaved German citizens working in 3rd reich's weapon factories wanted any much less to have these factories [[bomb]]ed?

Do you think [[French]] under German occupation wanted any much less to have [[British]] [[bomb]] the occupied cities?

No, survivors recall it seeing occupation [[government]] buildings [[bomb]]ed the most joyful moments, which led a lot of people to regain their spirits, and join the resistance.

MAD. I don't think anyone in the US or [[China]] is going to nuke anyone else because of survival instincts. There must be chain-of-command and multi-party custody controls in the militaries of all [[nuclear]] powers to prevent unauthorized release. In such stable cases, they become worse than White Elephants: can't get rid of them because of the liabilities of inviting [[nuclear]] and conventional wars, and can't keep them because they're expensive, inherently dangerous, and tempting for crazy people to use.

Economic interdependence also creates another layer of protection from either side going too far because of the economic [[warfare]] potential before [[nuclear]] or conventional wars would be considered.

[[China]] is reaching the point where they could invade [[Taiwan]] and be confident of getting away with it, but they're not quite there yet. We're currently in a narrow window where the US could and should unilaterally recognise [[Taiwan]]ese statehood and commit to a firm security guarantee.

Before [[Hong]] [[Kong]] I would probably have agreed with you, but You're assuming a purely rational reasoning. For [[China]], and Xi in particular, there is a big element of national and personal pride at stake. It's for the same reason they have risked strangling [[Hong]] [[Kong]] in order to bring it more in line with the rest of [[China]].

Xi (more so than his predecessors) is quite happy to take a short term loss for (what he sees) as a long term gain. In addition, he would love to be remembered in [[history]] as the man he reunified [[China]].

Agreed. This is what an obsessive focus on "facts and logic" at the expense of a similar focus on emotion, instinct, and subjectivity gets you. People have values that often contradict rationality, and in too many cases they're ready to [[kill]] and die for them.

Basically, if we "built the wall", they'd still have all the stuff, and we'd have increasingly more worthless numbers in our bank accounts.

Their posture is potentially lessening that dependency somewhat though - a [[company]] I work with, for example, now tries to find suppliers in Malaysia, Thailand, etc. for metalwork, PCB manufacture, assembly and things like that, which all would have just gone straight to [[China]] five years ago. This is a pretty small manufacturer with a fairly niche product, but I imagine others are thinking the same way.

No, this is not true. [[China]] depends on foreign technology much, much more than anyone depends on TSMC. Just look at the Huawei and ZTE sanctions.

Not to mention if [[China]] had that much leverage in the game they could easily sanction [[Taiwan]] and cut off probably a majority of its business dealings before resorting to invasion by force.

Did you know that [[Taiwan]] and [[China]] (pre-covid) could freely travel between the countries more or less, and even setup business like Foxconn that profit off [[Chinese]] labor? There's literally more cooperation between [[Taiwan]] and [[China]] than US and [[Cuba]].

This is because [[China]] had been attempting a policy of economic (and cultural) engagement with [[Taiwan]] for the best part of 20 years, up until the election of Tsai Ing-Wen in [[2016]]. [[China]] had pursued this policy while the KMT were in power in [[Taiwan]]; the KMT are generally considered to favor closer ties between [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]. Things have changed a bit since the DPP (the more "anti-[[China]]" of [[Taiwan]]'s two major political parties) won the [[2016]] and [[2020]] elections. I certainly don't know what the future holds, but I think [[China]] has now concluded that reunification through cultural/economic links is unlikely to succeed, not least because the idea of "one country, two systems" looks even less attractive after the events in [[Hong]] [[Kong]].

[[May]]be this is still true for now, but that too is changing. [[China]] was already wary of that dependency and put efforts underway to rid itself of this dependency. The Huawei and ZTE sanctions only had the effect of putting these efforts into hyperdrive. \[1\] gives an overview of historic and current efforts. tl;dr [[China]] is not yet close to self-sufficient but they are spending like crazy and making major progress.

Give it another 10, 15 years and the picture might look quite different, if it even takes them that long. And [[China]] is playing the long game anyway.

GP is likely referring to the use of electron tubes \[1\] perhaps juxtaposing (hypothetical [[Taiwan]]ese) tubes in [[1958]] with TSMC today(?). A decade earlier, however, the transistor was invented and would replace the use of tubes, at least for [[computer]]s.

Tubes, aka valves, are still popular in professional and consumer audio equipment, vintage and contemporary microphones, amplifiers and compressors.

If Assange ends up back in the US facing trial, does he have the same option as Ellsberg mentioned of triggering a Supreme Court action? Or is that only for US citizens?

I guess that would be good plea bargain leverage if it were possible.

The case would still go to the Supreme Court eventually; SCOTUS is relevant here as the court of final appeal for all federal cases.

The facts of the case, as well as Assange's personal obnoxiousness, would probably not be the best choice of a test case if you're looking to protect [[whistleblower]]s. Ellsberg is a much more sympathetic defendant.

I was thinking more of Assange's options for not being confined for the rest of his life. Honestly I think the odds are low of the [[UK]] [[government]] releasing him/declining the extradition, and less than even of the US [[government]] dropping the charges. He has already been practically im[[prison]]ed for years, plus actual im[[prison]]ment recently. Leveraging the threat of a Supreme Court fight against a face-saving US govt. approved light sentence might be a valid strategy at this point.
