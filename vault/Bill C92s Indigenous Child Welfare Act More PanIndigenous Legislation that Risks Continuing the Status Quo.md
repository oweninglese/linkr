Bill C-92 An Act respecting First Nations, Inuit and Metis [[child]]ren, youth and 
families has been heralded as a “historic turning point”, an “important first 
step”, a “major milestone” and other similarly over-used and under-impressive 
political phrases to describe yet another top-down initiative from the federal 
[[government]]. While the Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde 
(AFN) claimed that this legislation was “co-drafted” by the AFN and the federal 
[[government]], that was not the case. In fact, Dr. Cindy Blackstock confirmed that 
First Nations did not co-draft the legislation and First Nations were not even 
permitted to see the second draft before it was tabled. This should be no 
surprise as Justice [[Canada]] does not co-draft legislation with anyone other than 
the [[French]] and English legislative drafters at Justice [[Canada]] – this is their 
long-standing practice. Bill C-92 content is glaring evidence that First Nation 
experts in [[child]] [[welfare]] did not hold the pen on this bill.
 
 
There are many problems with this bill, but the main problem is it does not 
deliver any of what was promised by the federal [[government]]. Prime Minister 
[[[[Trudeau]]]]’s Liberal [[government]] promised to address the “humanitarian crisis” 
through federal legislation that fully recognized First Nation jurisdiction in 
relation to [[child]] [[welfare]]; that would provide statutory funding; and would 
eliminate the over-representation of First Nation [[child]]ren in care. If this bill
is not substantially amended before it is passed, it will not accomplish any of 
those important goals. Ultimately, it will be our [[child]]ren and our families on 
the ground - in our communities - that will pay the biggest price. The fact that
the AFN is promoting this bill so strenuously, without regard for the numerous 
and serious concerns raised by First Nation leaders, lawyers, academics and 
[[child]] [[welfare]] experts, shows how disconnected they are to the crisis at hand.
 
 
Despite the many issues raised by the Assembly of [[Manitoba]] Chiefs, the First 
Nations Child and Family Caring Society and others, the AFN supports this bill 
as do the Metis National Council (MNC) and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK). While 
I also have numerous, detailed concerns with the wording, structure and content 
of this bill, they are too many to include in this blog. What follows is a 
general overview of my concerns from a First Nation perspective. 
 
 
Pan-[[Indigenous]] Legislation
 
 
First of all, pan-[[Indian]] legislation has always been difficult to work with 
because of the differences between the 50-60 traditional [[Indigenous]] Nations in 
[[Canada]] that are now separated into 634+/- individual First Nations ([[Indian]] 
bands), across various provinces and within different [[treaty]] areas (some without
[[treaties]]). However, pan-First Nation legislation, with opt-in clauses and 
flexible provisions to deal with legal, political and cultural variances, would 
be far superior to what is offered in this bill. Bill C-92 purports to cram 
First Nations, Inuit and Metis into one act that offers the same legislative 
options to all three groups – despite their vastly different histories, 
socio-economic conditions and rights. 
 
 
There are vast differences between the legal rights and specific needs of First 
Nations, Inuit and the Metis. For example, the Metis have much better 
socio-economic conditions than First Nations and Inuit. Geographic differences 
between the Inuit and First Nations and Metis, also require solutions tailored 
to their unique situation. Failure to do so can create inequalities between the 
groups.
 
 
Substantive Inequality
 
 
This bill also misses the mark in its purported goal to support Nation-to-Nation
(First Nations), [[government]]-to-[[government]] (Metis) and Inuit-[[Crown]] relations by 
treating us all the same. Here’s the problem – when [[Canada]] treats all three 
groups formally the same, it prejudices the rights, needs and interests of those
with more acute conditions. In other words, by treating all three groups as 
formally equally, those with the most acute needs will be treated substantively 
unequal. While disadvantage should never be about a "race to the bottom", formal
equality will embed discrimination into the very structure of this legislation 
and will operate to disadvantage First Nations in particular. First Nations are 
larger in population, have higher rates of [[child]] apprehensions and higher rates 
of underlying [[poverty]], caused by the kinds of land dispossession and breach of 
[[treaty]] rights not experienced by Metis (with some exceptions). 
 
 
That is not to say that the Metis should not have their own framework- that is 
for them to decide what works best for them with the needs of their own 
constituency. First Nation, Metis and Inuit options should not be limited to the
same generic legislative framework, from the same budget line, which assumes the
same socio-economic needs, legal rights and interests. This pan-[[Indigenous]] 
template is not in line with the federal [[government]]’s promised 
“distinctions-based” approach and serves to embed substantive inequality into 
the act.
 
 
First Nation Jurisdiction
 
 
First Nation jurisdiction should be the heart of this bill. At best, what is 
offered is a delegated authority under federal jurisdiction, which is 
conditional on agreement with the provinces. At worst, this bill increases 
federal Ministerial control, while leaving provincial laws, policies and 
practices virtually in tact. Bill C-92 creates new powers for an unnamed federal
Minister to carry out the provisions of the legislation, make regulations, 
possibly collect data and provide a report to Parliament after five years. What 
is [[missing]] is the original purpose of the bill: to recognize First Nation 
jurisdiction. While it purports to recognize First Nation jurisdiction, it does 
so with several substantive conditions. First Nation jurisdiction and laws in 
relation to [[child]] [[welfare]] appear to be directly or indirectly subject to the 
following limits:
 
 
- [[Canadian]] Charter of Rights and Freedoms;
 
- [[Canadian]] Human Rights Act;
 
- Section 35 Constitution Act, [[1982]] jurisprudence and limits in relation to 
constitutionally protected rights;
 
- “Inherent right to self-[[government]]” which indirectly incorporates the 
impoverished definition of self-determination outlined in the Inherent Right 
Policy;
 
- Constitution Act, [[1867]], section 92 provincial jurisdiction, i.e. provincial 
laws are the minimum standard;
 
- Successful negotiation of a tri-lateral coordination agreement between the 
First Nation, province and federal [[government]] (or proof they made good faith 
effort to negotiate);
 
- Pre-existing definitions of “best interests of the [[child]]” from legal 
precedents;
 
- Sections 10-15 of Bill C-92, which outlines specific limitations in relation 
to the best interests of the [[child]], parental representation, notice of 
apprehensions, preventative care as the priority, and no apprehensions due to 
[[poverty]].
 
 
If a First Nation manages to ensure their laws meet all of these conditions, 
then they could be recognized as a “federal law”, but not a law in their own 
right – based on First Nation jurisdiction. It seems very clear that what is 
being offered is a delegated authority under federal jurisdiction, which is also
limited by the constitutional division of powers. Nothing in this bill binds a 
provincial [[government]] or requires them to even come to the table - let alone 
contribute any funding. Some First Nations may be okay with exercising their 
powers this way in order to address the urgent crisis, but the federal 
[[government]] should just be honest about it and stop trying to package it as First
Nation jurisdiction.
 
 
There is also no specific recognition for pre-existing First Nation laws – oral 
or written – except in the case of self-[[government]] agreements, and these laws 
would only be paramount to the extent of any conflict with Bill C-92. What of 
First Nations that choose not to make agreements with the province? What if a 
First Nation chooses to negotiate only with the federal [[government]]? There are 
far more questions than answers in this bill – all of which need to be addressed
in order to avoid legal chaos and uncertainty around jurisdiction.
 
 
Funding & Socio-Economic Conditions
 
 
My last major concern about this bill is the failure to include clear, directive
language that would provide a statutory guarantee for annual funding, that is 
based on equal access to holistic, wrap- around social programs and services, 
that take into account specific needs, population increases, inflation, 
geographic location, and actual costs. Without this statutory guarantee, any 
recognition or First Nation jurisdiction is entirely hollow. Substantial funds 
are required for the development and enforcement of First Nation laws, policies 
and regulations in relation to [[child]] and family services; staffing and training;
infrastructure; legal and technical [[research]] and advisory services; data 
collection and analysis; and monitoring, compliance, reporting and enforcement. 
The core issue has always been the long-standing chronic and discriminatory 
under-funding of social services for First Nations, like food, water, housing, 
[[health]] and education. This racist under-funding is what created the crisis and 
serves to maintain. Legislation is not needed to end discriminatory funding, but
if legislation is to be enacted, a firm commitment for funding needs to be 
included.
 
 
It is noteworthy that there is no mention of First Nation [[Aboriginal]] rights or 
[[treaty]] rights in relation to the funding that attaches to [[child]] [[welfare]]. While 
it may be politically expedient to create an act that is neutral on “rights” for
all parties, this must be in exchange for a substantive, enforceable legal 
funding commitment. Long gone are the days where First Nations can reasonably or
responsibly rely on the word of Ministers to hope that they fulfill their 
political promises. Ministers change, [[government]]s change and the law changes – 
which is why, if there is to be legislation, that it include a statutory 
guarantee of funding. Without it, this legislation is empty of any real 
intention or ability to end the status quo – a price that will continue to be 
paid by our [[child]]ren and their [[child]]ren. First Nation cannot afford to lose any 
more [[child]]ren to a racist and sexually violent system that decreases their life 
chances and limits their ability to enjoy life with their families, communities,
and Nations. The increasing [[foster]] care rates, [[incarceration]] rates and [[murdered]] 
and [[missing]] rates compel us to act urgently and with purpose.
 
 
All that is required is for Parliament to sit down with First Nation [[child]] 
[[welfare]] experts and make the required amendments. Without substantive 
amendments, this bill may end up causing more harm than good and inject legal 
chaos into an already broken system and risk the lives of more of our [[child]]ren. 
[[Canada]] has apologized for the trauma caused by residential schools, while at the
same time admitting that [[child]] [[welfare]] has continued the trauma. [[Canada]] has 
stated that this is a humanitarian crisis and as such is legally and morally 
bound to do better. 
 
 
It’s time to sit at the table and urgently work this out for the sake of the 
[[child]]ren.
