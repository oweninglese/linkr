# Erik Prince Planned to Create Private Army in Ukraine: Exclusive | Time

> ## Excerpt
> Documents obtained exclusively by TIME reveal the American businessman's ambitious plans to take over Ukraine's military industry.

---
On the second night of his visit to Kyiv, Erik Prince had a dinner date on his agenda. A few of his Ukrainian associates had arranged to meet the [[America]]n billionaire at the Vodka Grill that evening, Feb. 23, [[2020]]. The choice of venue seemed unusual. The Vodka Grill, a since-defunct nightclub next to a KFC franchise in a rough part of town, rarely saw patrons as powerful as Prince.

As the party got seated inside a private karaoke room on the second floor, Igor Novikov, who was then a top adviser to [[Ukraine]]’s [[President]], remembers feeling a little nervous. He had done some reading about Blackwater, the private military [[company]] Prince had founded in [[1997]], and he knew about the massacre its troops had perpetrated during the U.S. war in Iraq. Coming face to face that night with the world’s most prominent soldier of fortune, Novikov remembers thinking: “What does this guy want from us?”

It soon became clear that Prince wanted a lot from [[Ukraine]]. According to interviews with close associates and confidential documents detailing his ambitions, Prince hoped to hire [[Ukraine]]’s combat veterans into a private military [[company]]. Prince also wanted a big piece of [[Ukraine]]’s military-industrial complex, including factories that make engines for fighter jets and helicopters. His full plan, dated [[June]] [[2020]] and obtained exclusively by TIME this spring, includes a “roadmap” for the creation of a “vertically integrated aviation defense consortium” that could bring $10 billion in revenues and investment.

The audacity of the proposal fit with Prince’s record as a businessman. For nearly a quarter century, the former Navy SEAL has been a pioneer in the private military industry, raising armies in the Middle East and [[Africa]], training commandos at his base in [[North]] Carolina and deploying security forces around the world for the State Department and the [[CIA]]. Under the [[Trump]] Administration, Prince’s family—a powerful clan of right-wing Republican donors from Michigan—saw their in[[flu]]ence rise. Prince’s sister, Betsy DeVos, was appointed Secretary of Education, while Prince himself leveraged contacts in the White House to chase major deals around the world.

The ones he pursued in [[Ukraine]] were among the most ambitious of his long career. But with [[Trump]] out of office, the Ukrainian [[government]] has slowed the process and invited more competition for the assets Prince coveted. “Had it been another four years of [[Trump]], Erik would probably be closing the deal,” says Novikov, one of its lead Ukrainian negotiators.

This account of Prince’s ambitions in [[Ukraine]] is based on interviews with seven sources, including current and former U.S. and Ukrainian officials as well as people who worked directly with Prince to try to realize his aspirations in [[Ukraine]]. Those business plans, which have not been previously reported, were confirmed by four of the sources on both sides of the negotiations, all of whom recalled meeting in person with Prince last year to discuss them. The documents describe a series of ventures that would give Prince a pivotal role in [[Ukraine]]’s military industry and its ongoing conflict with [[Russia]], which has taken more than 14,000 lives since it began seven years ago.

The documents detail several previously unreported ventures that Prince and his partners wanted the Ukrainian [[government]] to approve**.** One proposal would create a new private military [[company]] that would draw personnel from among the veterans of the ongoing war in eastern [[Ukraine]]. Another deal would build a new munitions factory in [[Ukraine]], while a third would consolidate [[Ukraine]]’s leading aviation and aerospace firms into a consortium that could compete with “the likes of Boeing and Airbus.”

At least one of Prince’s offers to [[Ukraine]] appeared to be in line with U.S. geopolitical interests. As the _Wall Street_ _Journal_ [first reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/security-contractor-erik-prince-is-in-talks-to-acquire-ukraines-motor-sich-1[[1572]]949809) in Nov. [[2019]], Prince has been competing against a [[Chinese]] firm to buy a Ukrainian factory called Motor Sich, which produces advanced aircraft engines. [[China]] sought those engines to develop its air force. The U.S., concerned about the rapid growth of the [[Chinese]] military, has long urged [[Ukraine]] not to complete the sale. Prince emerged as the [[America]]n alternative, offering to save the factory from [[China]]’s clutches.

But the Ukrainians had serious concerns about working with Prince, according to three people involved in the negotiations. Prince’s choice of allies in Kyiv—two men with ties to [[Russia]]—raised particular alarm. His Ukrainian business partner is Andriy Artemenko, who [made headlines](https://www.nytimes.com/[[2017]]/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html) in [[2017]] by offering the [[Trump]] Administration a “peace plan” for the war in [[Ukraine]] that envisioned ways for the U.S. to lift sanctions against [[Russia]]. Another Prince ally in Kyiv was [Andriy Derkach](https://time.com/6052302/andriy-derkach-profile/), a Ukrainian legislator whom the U.S. has accused of being an “active [[Russia]]n agent.” Both Artemenko and Derkach worked to advance Prince’s business ventures in [[Ukraine]] last year.

“We had to wonder: Is this the best sort of partnership we can get from the [[America]]ns? This group of shady characters working for a close ally of [[Trump]]?” says Novikov, the former aide to [[Ukraine]]’s president. “It felt like the worst [[America]] had to offer.” Those concerns only heightened when, at a pivotal moment in negotiations, one of Prince’s associates proferred in writing a “participation offer” that Novikov considered an attempted bribe.

As the deals ran into resistance from the [[government]] in [[Ukraine]], Prince’s allies faced bigger problems in [[New]] York City, where both Artemenko and Derkach are now under criminal investigation. The U.S. [[Attorney]] in the [[Eastern]] District of [[New]] York declined to comment on the investigation, which is [reportedly focused](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/27/nyregion/trump-ukraine-rudy-giuliani-[[2020]]-presidential-election.html) on whether the two men were involved in a suspected [[Russia]]n plot to sway the [[2020]] presidential election.

Prince does not appear to be a focus of that investigation. But Artemenko tells TIME that federal investigators have questioned him about his relationship with Prince. In interviews with TIME in [[April]] and [[May]], both Derkach and Artemenko denied wrongdoing and described the investigation as part of a political witch hunt against [[Trump]]’s allies. Prince did not respond to numerous requests for comment, including a detailed list of questions about the documents outlining his proposals for [[Ukraine]].

**Among the guests** at the Vodka Grill was Prince’s business partner, Artemenko, a tall, clean-shaven lobbyist in his early 50s. Artemenko says he has worked with Prince in the air-cargo industry for at least six years, transporting everything from weapons to [[vaccine]]s around the world. Born and raised in Kyiv, he now resides mostly in the [[Washington]] area. In text messages obtained by TIME, he refers to Prince as “the boss.”

Their relationship began not long after Prince emerged from the Blackwater scandal of [[2007]]. That fall, a group of Prince’s soldiers-for-hire shot up a crowded square in Baghdad, [[kill]]ing 17 civilians and wounding 20 others. Several of the gunmen were [[sentenced]] to decades in U.S. [[prison]]s for their roles in the massacre. ([[Trump]] pardoned four of them in his final weeks in office.) Prince’s testimony in [[Congress]] about the incident drove a national debate about the privatization of war, turning him, at the age of 38, into the defiant face of the modern-day mercenary.

In the wake of those [[kill]]ings, Blackwater lost a $1 billion contract to guard U.S. diplomats and officials in Iraq. But the [[company]] rebranded and continued to thrive. The [[Obama]] Administration granted major contracts to Prince’s firm to provide security in conflict zones. Prince’s interests expanded well beyond the military sector. He [[trade]]d oil and minerals in [[Africa]]. He assembled a private army for his friend, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. He prepared a force in Somalia to combat pirates in the Gulf of Aden. He helped train a hit squad for the [[CIA]]. When [[Trump]] took office, Prince called on the new Administration to privatize the war effort in Afghanistan, publicly [pitching a plan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_skhRZ0Mw) that would let contractors handle many of the U.S. military’s functions.

Over the years, one of Prince’s most reliable lines of business has been wartime logistics: moving people and supplies into areas of conflict. Starting in [[2006]], the aviation arm of Blackwater air-dropped food and weapons for U.S. troops on the front lines in Afghanistan. “If you need to transport stuff in and out of a war zone, you’re not going to call UPS,” says a person familiar with Prince’s business operations. “His [[company]] does that.”

After working as a cargo broker in the [[2000]]s, Artemenko had founded his own transport [[company]] in [[2010]], AirTrans LLC, which frequently flew cargo for Prince’s operation, he tells TIME. In [[2015]], Artemenko says, AirTrans officially became a part of Prince’s [[company]], Frontier Resource Group.

Around that time, Artemenko says, the partners began discussing a venture in [[Ukraine]]’s weapons industry. [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] had been at war since Moscow annexed [[Crimea]] in 2[[014]], leading the one-time allies to stop selling weapons to each other. The hardware [[Russia]] needed most were engines for its helicopters and fighter jets, many of which are still produced at [[Soviet]]-era plants in eastern [[Ukraine]].

Apart from the potential to earn billions of dollars in profit, Artemenko says he saw these factories as a way to broker an end to the war in [[Ukraine]]. “The [[Russia]]ns need the full complex of aviation technology, starting with the engines,” he says. “This is a reason to force them to the negotiating table and make a peace deal. We can say: ‘OK, you need these spare parts, engines and everything else from [[Ukraine]]? Fine, but we want a deal for \[eastern [[Ukraine]]\], and then we want an agreement on [[Crimea]].'”

The idea did not get much traction. Ukrainian officials recoiled at the notion of lifting their arms embargo against [[Russia]] in the middle of a war. Another one of Artemenko’s peace plans gained notoriety in [[2017]], when a draft of it [reportedly landed](https://www.nytimes.com/[[2017]]/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html) on the desk of Michael Flynn, [[Trump]]’s first national security adviser. That plan, like the first, went nowhere.

Around the same time, Prince held a meeting on an island in the Seychelles with Kirill Dmitriev, a [[Russia]]n official. The [[Washington]] _Post_ [reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/blackwater-founder-held-secret-seychelles-meeting-to-establish-trump-putin-back-channel/[[2017]]/04/03/95908a08-[[1648]]-11e7-ada0-1489b735b3a3_story.html) their aim was to create a “back channel” from the Kremlin to the White House, an allegation both men denied. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report published in [[April]] [[2019]] devoted a few pages to the Seychelles meeting. According to the report, Prince told his [[Russia]]n interlocutor that he was “looking forward to a new era of cooperation and conflict resolution.”

**By the time Prince** set his sights on the Ukrainian military industry, the nation’s conflict with [[Russia]] had settled into a kind of stalemate, with sporadic shelling and sniper fire along the front lines. Peace talks had stalled, and [[Ukraine]]’s [[government]] was increasingly desperate for a way out of the impasse.

The [[Trump]] Administration did little to help. [[Trump]]’s priority in [[Ukraine]] was not to make peace; it was to advance his own political fortunes. Amid his campaign for re-election, [[Trump]] asked [[Ukraine]] to investigate his opponent, Joe Biden, and held up military aid to [[Ukraine]] as a means of pressure. The campaign of coercion caused a breakdown in U.S.-Ukrainian relations.

Some advisers to [[President]] Volodymyr Zelensky saw Prince as a way to repair the damage. They wanted him to help arrange a meeting with someone in [[Trump]]’s inner circle, ideally Jared Kushner, the [[President]]’s son-in-law, says Novikov, who was [[Ukraine]]’s liaison to the [[America]]ns at the time.

Prince was unwilling to make that connection, says a person familiar with his thinking on the matter. “Erik made it very clear that he didn’t have the keys to [[Trump]]’s White House, and that he didn’t want to play that game.”

As an alternative, Prince’s team offered to line up an [[America]]n lobbyist for [[Ukraine]] named Joseph Schmitz. A former Blackwater executive, Schmitz had been a foreign-policy adviser to the [[Trump]] campaign in [[2016]] and had contacts in the Administration. He was ready to represent [[Ukraine]] for a fee of $500,000 plus expenses, according to a proposed lobbying agreement obtained by TIME. (Schmitz did not respond to emails seeking comment.) Ukrainian officials received that agreement early last year from Artemenko’s lobbying firm but did not sign it.

Prince had sought some local assistance of his own. Among the people he met with in Kyiv was Derkach, the Ukrainian member of [[parliament]] whom the U.S. later [accused of being a [[Russia]]n agent](https://time.com/6052302/andriy-derkach-profile/)**.**

Derkach, who confirmed to TIME that the meeting took place, was well positioned to help Prince understand the terrain. He had worked in [[Ukraine]]’s aviation sector after graduating from an elite university for spies in Moscow, the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB. In the early [[2010]]s, when Derkach served as an adviser to [[Ukraine]]’s prime minister, one of his tasks had been to develop the aviation and machine-building sectors of the nation’s economy.

Derkach says he was intrigued by Prince’s vision for these industries. One major advantage Prince brought to the table was his list of contacts in the developing world. He had worked for many years in the Middle East and [[Africa]], dealing with warlords and autocrats who could become new clients for Ukrainian weapons and aircraft. The main flaw in the plan, Derkach says, was the cooperation it required from [[Ukraine]]’s local factory bosses and oligarchs**,** who control much of the military-industrial complex.

“That’s not so much an issue with Erik,” he says. “It’s a problem of corruption in [[Ukraine]], where you have the factory directors who do not want to sign documents and give up power.” Derkach recalled telling Prince: “‘You’ve worked everywhere. But [[Ukraine]] is special. It’s very hard to get any traction here. You have to gather a serious team of people who will move the process along.'”

Derkach says he did not join this team, and declines to say whether he was ever paid for the advice he gave Prince. But after their meeting in Kyiv, Derkach began urging Ukrainian authorities to support the deal Prince wanted. In [[March]] [[2020]], he invited Novikov, the presidential adviser, to a meeting to discuss the plans. “Derkach said, ‘We already have everyone on board, and still the deal is stalling,'” Novikov recalls. Derkach wanted to know who in the [[President]]’s administration was standing in Prince’s way. “That was the only thing he wanted to discuss with me,” Novikov says.

**In the early summer of [[2020]]**, [[Ukraine]] moved to cement its partnership with Prince, whose intentions had become far more detailed and ambitious. In one message to Ukrainian officials, Artemenko provided Prince’s passport information along with a summary of their agenda for an upcoming trip. In a follow-up message, he noted Prince would be in Kyiv for several days during the week of [[June]] 15, [[2020]], and requested meetings with senior officials in the defense and intelligence agencies, adding cryptically: “There will be no official calls to [[government]] officials, as this visit is strictly private and apolitical.”

Arriving in Kyiv on a chartered flight from Minsk, Prince held a meeting that week with Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, according to messages obtained by TIME between the people who arranged Prince’s travels. (Yermak confirmed to TIME that the meeting took place but declined to discuss it in detail.)

Things appeared to move quickly from there. The [[President]]’s office put Prince in touch with a law firm in Kyiv that frequently works for the Ukrainian [[government]]. The firm prepared a legal framework for completing the deal Prince wanted. The work was complex, especially when it came to acquiring Motor Sich, says the person familiar with Prince’s thinking.

The factory had been privatized in the [[1990]]s, during [[Ukraine]]’s chaotic transition to capitalism. In [[2016]] and [[2017]], [[Chinese]] investors bought up shares in the factory from its private owners, paying an estimated $700 million for control of Motor Sich. They were not expected to give it up without a fight in the courts. So the lawyers had to find legal grounds for [[Ukraine]] to take control of the asset before re-selling it to a new investor. Their plan relied on a regulatory snag: [[Ukraine]]’s anti-trust agency had not granted approval to the [[Chinese]] investment. “It’s this weird situation where the [[Chinese]] bought the asset, never received approval for it, and it’s basically standing still,” says the person familiar with Prince’s thinking. That could allow the Ukrainian [[government]] to say: “‘We’re going to take control of the asset because it’s basically not being properly managed,’” the person says. “In a nutshell, that’s the argument.”

In the weeks after Prince’s visit, his associates prepared two versions of a detailed business plan and sent them to officials in Zelensky’s office. The first, dated [[June]] 23, [[2020]], stated that the acquisition of Motor Sich would require $50 million to purchase a minority stake, and another $950 million to buy 76% of the factory**.** The money was meant to come from Windward Capital, an investment vehicle that Prince [has reportedly used](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-[[health]]-[[corona[[virus]]]]-prince-exclusive-idCAKCN2DG1GZ) in the past.

Another business plan for [[Ukraine]]’s military industry, dated [[June]] 29, [[2020]], provided new details and incentives for the [[government]] to participate. It described a planned takeover of Antonov, the state-owned airplane manufacturer, by replacing its [[[[CEO]]]] with an executive from Artemenko’s [[company]]. The proposal also called for an “ultimatum” to be issued to the [[Chinese]] investors in Motor Sich, who would be forced to either accept an “immediate sale” or face the “loss of value,” the plan stated. “If [[Chinese]] remain uncooperative,” the Ukrainian [[government]] should take over the factory and transfer control to new investors, the document says.

Another element of the business plan described a partnership between [[Ukraine]]’s main intelligence service and Lancaster 6, a private military [[company]] that has [previously](https://www.abc.net.au/news/[[2020]]-09-14/the-fighter-pilot-the-mercenary-boss-and-the-warlord/12644052) [been involved](https://www.thedailybeast.com/air-war-for-profit-inside-erik-princes-push-to-rule-the-skies) with Prince’s deals in [[Africa]] and the Middle East. This partnership, which required approval from [[Ukraine]]’s [[parliament]], would build a “state-of-the-art training center” and a “specialized services enterprise”—industry jargon for a private military operation—that would be involved in [[Ukraine]]’s “strategic planning, logistics, risk management, security forces training and consulting concerning security risks,” according to the plan. (The head of Lancaster 6, a [longtime Prince associate](https://www.abc.net.au/news/[[2020]]-09-14/the-fighter-pilot-the-mercenary-boss-and-the-warlord/12644052) named Christiaan Durrant, told TIME he was not aware of any such documents and asked for a copy; after being sent one, he stopped responding.)

Three of the projects described in the documents also include a “participation offer,” or a cut of the yearly profits. The participation offers listed in the document would be worth a total of around $35 million per year if the plan were to be executed. (The documents do not make clear who would get this money or why.) Novikov, who negotiated with Prince and studied the plan closely while serving as a presidential adviser, says he understood this as a proposal for kickbacks to [[government]] officials. “It looked like a bribe,” he says.

Paul Pelletier, a former U.S. federal prosecutor, agreed that the reference to “participation offers” looks suspicious. It would be likely to cause “alarm bells,” he says, at the Justice Department, where Pelletier served for years as a senior official overseeing foreign bribery cases. “On its face, the terms suggest some sort of kickback payments to [[government]] contracting officials—a definite no-no,” says Pelletier, who reviewed the document at TIME’s request. “No money or offers of money can flow to [[government]] officials, period.”

Artemenko insists that he and Prince never acted corruptly in their dealings, in [[Ukraine]] or elsewhere. “We never paid a bribe at the table,” he tells TIME. “We don’t want to do anything wrong. Only the transparent and legal way.” (Asked directly about the purpose of the participation offers, Artemenko’s lawyer, Anthony Capozzolo, declined to comment.)

Prince’s lawyer, Matthew Schwartz, did not respond to a detailed list of questions from TIME, including specific questions about the participation offers and the allegation that they referred to kickbacks.

**As [[Trump]]’s chances** in the presidential race began to look less certain in the fall of [[2020]], so did the prospects for Prince and his contacts in [[Ukraine]].

In [[September]], the U.S. imposed sanctions against Derkach, accusing him of being an “active [[Russia]]n agent” involved in [a plot to help [[Trump]] win a second term](https://time.com/6052302/andriy-derkach-profile/). About a month later, four [[FBI]] agents showed up at Artemenko’s home in the [[Washington]] area, Artemenko recalls. They wanted to know about his work in [[Ukraine]], and his relationships with Prince, [[Trump]] lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others. “They asked me about my relationship with Erik, how we met, where we met,” Artemenko says. “Normal questions.”

Meanwhile, the dilemma with Motor Sich has only gotten more complex. The [[Chinese]] investors in the factory filed a [$3.5 billion claim](https://www.rferl.org/a/china-motor-sich-skyrizon-arbitration-ukraine/31007011.html) in [[December]] [[2020]] at an international court of arbitration, claiming that [[Ukraine]]’s decision to block the sale was illegal. The Ukrainian [[government]] responded by imposing sanctions against the [[Chinese]] investors, one of whom [called the move](https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/arakhamia-chinese-investor-paid-700-million-for-motor-sich-without-permission.html) “an abuse of state power and the suppression of normal business activity.”

Under the Biden Administration, the U.S. does not seem likely to throw its weight behind Prince’s projects in [[Ukraine]]. “The U.S. has not been very pro-Erik,” says the person familiar with his thinking. In a statement to TIME, a State Department spokesperson said the U.S. supports [[Ukraine]]’s efforts to block the sale of Motor Sich to the [[Chinese]] firm, but avoided taking a position on who should own the factory or saying anything about Prince.

That leaves the status of Prince’s plans for [[Ukraine]] unclear. Yermak, the presidential chief of staff, says the [[government]] intends to nationalize Motor Sich and keep it under state control. Private investors, including Prince and his partners, would be welcome to bid on a stake in the factory through a competitive tender, Yermak told TIME in an interview in [[April]]. “We are interested in working with all our partners,” he says. “We are interested in there being fairness.”

At that time, Prince’s business partner said the two were still interested in bidding for the factory. “We are ready to show the money and explain the plan,” Artemenko says.
