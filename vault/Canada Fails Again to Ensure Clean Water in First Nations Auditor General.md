AUDITOR GENERAL REPORT ON CLEAN WATER IN FIRST NATIONS
 
PRIME MINISTER JUSTIN TRUDEAU had no problem finding $7 billion dollars to buy 
Trans Mountain pipeline - so where’s the money for water pipelines to First 
Nations?
 
This week, the Auditor General for [[Canada]] (AG) released her report on whether 
[[Canada]] is providing enough support to ensure that First Nations have access to 
clean drinking water. The answer was a clear no. This is despite the Liberal 
[[government]]’s promise back in [[2015]] to eliminate all long-term drinking water 
advisories in First Nations by [[March]] 2021.
 
The report entitled "Access to Safe Drinking Water in First Nations Communities"
found that federal policies and funding amounts did not align with its promise 
to end all long-term drinking water advisories (DWA) on reserve. But the story 
doesn't begin or end with DWAs.

FIRST NATIONS LANDS & WATERS
 
First of all, we would not be in this crisis if our sovereign jurisdiction, laws
and governing powers over our traditional territories and resources were 
respected. [[Canada]] has created and maintained this crisis after generations of 
colonization, genocide, land dispossession and state control of our water 
sources. 
 
And no, there is nothing in any of the [[treaties]] that said the [[Crown]] could take 
all the water, control it, monetize it and then deny clean water to First 
Nations. But that is exactly what has happened, despite the fact that the [[United]]
Nations has recognized access to safe drinking water as a human right - over a 
decade ago.
 
[[Canada]] continues to act as an outlaw breaking [[Indigenous]] laws, its own domestic 
laws and international laws in relation to human rights. When it comes to the 
basic human rights of [[Indigenous]] peoples - [[Canada]] ignores its own so-called 
"rule of law". The continued failure to provide clean drinking water to First 
Nations is a prime example of systemic [[racism]].

CANADA ASSUMED JURISDICTION OVER RESERVE LANDS
 
The [[Crown]] first steals [[Indigenous]] lands, resources and waterways through fraud, 
deception and breach of its own laws, and then reserves unto itself jurisdiction
in the Constitution Act [[1867]] over "[[Indian]]s and lands reserved for the [[Indian]]s". 
In other words, the federal [[government]] has assumed legal and financial 
responsibility for water infrastructure on reserve. And this water crisis is the
result.
 
First Nations have been calling on the federal [[government]] to address the water 
crisis for decades. In [[1995]], Health [[Canada]] and [[Indian]] and [[North]]ern Affairs 
[[Canada]] (INAC) found that 25% of water systems on reserve posed [[health]] and safety
risks. In [[2001]], INAC found "significant risks" to water quality and safety in 
75% of water systems on reserve - a shocking number.
 
A decade later in [[2011]], INAC reported to the AG that more than 50% of water 
systems still posed significant risks to community members. In 2[[014]], it was 43% 
of water systems and here we are in 2021, and the risk level hasn’t changed.
 
At a press conference about the AG’s report, [[Indigenous]] Services (ISC) Minister 
Marc Miller said that while they had hoped to address all long-term drinking 
water advisories, they lost "a construction season" due to the [[pandemic]]. One 
construction season? If we only start the clock from [[1995]] forward, then they’ve 
lost 25 years of construction seasons. 
 
The AG pointed out that the delays by ISC were there long before the [[pandemic]] 
and referenced previous AG reports that have consistently raised concerns about 
the lack of clean drinking water in First Nations.
 
And let’s not forget the numbers here. In addition to the 60 long-term DWAs that
are left to be resolved – half of those have been in place for more than a 
decade. Imagine an entire decade in [[Fredericton]], [[Toronto]], [[Winnipeg]] or Saskatoon 
without clean drinking water and where there was only enough water to bathe once
a week. That would NEVER be tolerated anywhere else for anyone else. The 
situation would be treated as the urgent crisis that it is.

[[Canadian]] Dimension: Where's [[[[Trudeau]]]]'s pipeline for water to First Nations?

o-first-nations?[9]
 
 
FEDERAL POLICIES FOR WATER ON RESERVE ARE DECADES OLD
 
The federal [[government]]’s less than sincere commitment to urgently address the 
water crisis in First Nations is betrayed by the fact that their policies are 
decades old. The sad reality is that no one in the federal [[government]] has been 
concerned enough about the [[health]], safety and well-being of First Nations 
families to treat the lack of access to safe drinking water as a crisis.
 
In fact, over the years, AG reports found that the federal [[government]] couldn’t 
even be bothered to do annual inspections for all the water systems, despite 
their medium to high-risk. It's as if the words "significant risks" to community
members were merely notations in a report.
 
The Auditor General also noted that some of the federal [[government]]’s policies in
relation to water systems on reserve are decades old and some were written in 
the [[1960]]’s. She further noted that they have not amended their policy in 
relation to funding for the operations and maintenance of water systems on 
reserve for over 30 years.
 
This means that the funding they do provide to First Nations to maintain their 
water systems does not take into account new technologies, the actual costs to 
maintain or the risk-level and actual condition of the water system. On top of 
that, they only provide up to 80% of the costs determined by this outdated 
policy, while at the same time paying First Nation water operators 30% less than
the rest of [[Canada]].
 
Is there any wonder why the federal [[government]] is constantly chasing drinking 
water advisories and never seems to catch up?
 
Think about it this way: if your roof has a leak and it would cost $10,000 to 
repair but you only “invest” $1,000 what happens? Well, your roof is entirely 
fixed, it continues to leak causing more damage to the roof and the rest of the 
house. The next year, it will cost you $30,000 to fix the roof and the extra 
repairs.
 
This is the point the AG made: “If funding to operate and maintain water systems
is insufficient, water systems may continue to deteriorate at a 
faster-than-expected rated.”

First Nations Water Problems a Crisis of [[Canada]]'s Own Making
 
https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-[[2019]]/first-nations-water-probl
ems-crisis-canadas-making/[12]
 
THE NUMBERS SHELL GAME
 
It’s important to dig into the numbers to truly understand the full scope of 
this problem. The AG's report was limited to only the 1,050 "public water 
systems" in 600+ First Nations. This is because ISC’s water policies and funding
formulas do not provide support for those who rely on wells or cisterns. Worse 
than that, their water policies do not support for those without any running 
water!
 
And this isn’t a small number. More than one third of all households on reserve 
are in the category of wells, cisterns or no running water at all. So the 
problem is much bigger than it would first appear. 
 
It’s also important to look at how ISC has differentiated between short-term and
long-term DWAs. The [[government]] seems to be congratulating itself for having 
"only" 60 long-term DWAs left, meanwhile over the same period, the AG confirmed 
that there were 1,281 short-term DWA. 
 
More than 10% of those short-term DWAs were for periods of two months or more. 
But worse than that, the AG also found in some First Nations, they had multiple 
short-term DWAs, that when added up, were more than a year in total cumulative 
length. But they don't get counted in long-term DWAs and misrepresents the 
seriousness of short-term DWAs. Even with long-term DWAs, they get counted as 
"lifted" or "resolved" if temporary measures are made to bring in water - even 
if the deficiencies in the water system have not been remediated.
 
DWA numbers are clearly not the most transparent or effective way to measure 
whether or not the water crisis has been remedied. The more transparent measure 
would be whether each household on the reserve and each daycare, school, [[health]] 
centre, community building and business, has consistently safe, reliable, clean 
drinking water and sanitation.
 
That’s the number that matters – not how many DWAs you lifted one minute but 
were re-imposed the next. That’s a shell game that only serves to hide a much 
larger problem and certainly doesn’t respect the human right of First Nations to
water.

LET'S TALK PIPELINES...
 
[[Canada]] brags about having 84,000 kms of pipelines all over the country servicing
the oil and gas industry. When confronted with losing the Trans Mountain 
pipeline, [[[[Trudeau]]]] managed to find $7 billion dollars in a hurry to buy it. So, 
where are the pipelines bringing clean water to First Nations [[[[Trudeau]]]]?
 
There are man camps full of thousands of mostly men flown into First Nation 
territories, in even in the remotest of places, that have access to [[health]]care, 
safe, mould-free housing, [[health]]y food, and clean drinking water and sanitation.
So, where is the [[health]]care, housing, food and clean water for First Nations?
 
[[Canada]]’s military brings millions of litres of fresh water to other countries in
emergencies – so where’s the clean water for First Nations? [[Canada]] has spent 
more than $240 billion dollars on [[pandemic]] relief measures, but there isn’t 
enough money to ensure water in First Nations during a [[pandemic]]?
 
Minister Miller says they lost a construction season during the [[pandemic]] and 
that’s why they couldn’t address the water crisis. Really? Because the 
construction season for oil and gas pipelines, the tar sands, [[mining]] projects 
and other extractive projects and infrastructure continued during the [[pandemic]]. 
But construction couldn't proceed on water pipelines?

No one but Liberal politicians are buying these excuses anymore. The reason all 
First Nation households don’t have access to clean water is widespread, 
longstanding, systemic [[racism]] and a denial of basic human rights for First 
Nations.
 
It is the same reason why there is a housing crisis on reserve; the same reason 
why there is a humanitarian crisis of First Nations [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care; the
same reason why there are crisis-level rates of [[incarceration]] of First Nations; 
and why there are thousands of [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women and girls 
in this country.
 
Until we address the [[racism]] in [[Canada]]’s laws, policies and practices, we’ll 
never end genocide against First Nations or the water crisis. There is no such 
thing as incre[[mental]] equality or partial human rights. You either have them or 
you don’t. And clearly, First Nations have neither equality nor the protection 
of human rights.
 
We need [[Canadian]]s to stand up and say this isn’t right. Demand that the federal 
[[government]] bring every resource to bear to ensure safe, reliable, clean drinking
water and sanitation to every single household on reserve. Not in two years, 
three years or after the next election - but this year. Next year's reports 
needs to count households with water and sanitation - not DWAs. 
 
Treat this as the national emergency that it is and get it done like they would 
if this was in their own backyards. We all know it would only take a week 
without water for any of these politicians to call in the army in their town or 
city if this happened to them. So get it done. And while they are at it, they 
should also return some of the lands, resources and waterways they took - so 
this isn't a problem in the future.
