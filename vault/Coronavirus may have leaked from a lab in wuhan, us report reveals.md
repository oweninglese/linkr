The origins of [[COVID]]-19 have been brought into question again after fresh global interest in enquiries into whether it may have [[leaked]] from a lab in [[Wuhan]]. Now, a report by a US [[government]] national laboratory claims that the lab-leak hypothesis is plausible, urging further investigation into the [[virus]]’ origins.

Reported first by the [[Wall]] [[Street]] [[Journal]], the  study was undertaken over the course of [[May]] [[2020]] by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in [[California]]. After completion, the study was forwarded to the US State Department during the last days of [[Donald]] [[Trump]]’s presidency, when interest in the lab-leak theory was starting to brew again.

According to [[WSJ]], the lab based their assessment on the genomic analysis of [[COVID]]-19 [[virus]].

Scientists across the world have now joined the chorus in demanding further enquiry, especially after US [[President]] Joe Biden ordered aides to probe the [[virus]]’ origins. [[American]] agencies posit two scenarios - that the [[virus]] [[leaked]] from the lab due to a malfunction or that the [[virus]] spread among humans after contact with an infected animal. No conclusions have been drawn yet.

An earlier report by The [[Wall]] [[Street]] [[Journal]] released on Monday alleges that researchers at the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology were sick with [[Covid]]-like symptoms before the outbreak in [[November]] [[2019]], for which they sought medical care. 

US top infectious disease expert [[Fauci]] has urged further probe into the [[virus]]' origins after coming under the radar for alleged connections with the [[Wuhan]] laboratory.

Meanwhile, US officials claim that [[China]] has not been transparent about the origins of [[COVID]]-19. [[Beijing]] has continued to denied this charge, claiming that the [[virus]] emerged naturally. On Monday, a [[World]] Health Organization official, Mike Ryan said that the agency cannot force [[China]] to reveal more details on the origins of the [[pandemic]], but revealed plans to commission further probes into the same.
