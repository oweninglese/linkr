Canada as framework nation

A

s a smaller ally far from Europe, Canada is not an obvious choice for being a
Framework Nation. Yet NATO’s goal to enhance the security of its Allies on the
border with Russia has precedent in Canada’s century-long strategic commitment to
Europe. Close cooperation with the United States and with NATO Allies is the essence of
Canada’s defence posture. Russia upending Europe’s post-Cold War order in 2014 was a
direct challenge to Canada’s strategic interests. Canada’s strategic relationship with Europe
is second only to the United States. It has a vested interest in the territorial integrity of
NATO Allies, which, if compromised, risks undermining European unity and stability.
Canada’s interest in Europe transcends security and defence. Canada recently negotiated
a Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union (EU).
Though modest in overall volume of trade, the political symbolism of the CETA allows
for deeper trade relations. The crisis with Russia re-ignited a sense of principle and purpose
for Canadian involvement in Europe. Canada’s relationship with NATO and the EU is
not only about interests but also a set of values given how NATO fosters a rules-based
international order that is guided by “the principles of individual liberty, democracy, and
the rule of law...”.2 Moreover, Russia’s actions in Ukraine and its threatening posture
towards the Baltic nations also resonates in Canada. Over one million Canadian citizens
– and voters – identify as being of Ukrainian descent. Many other Canadians trace their
ancestry to the Baltic states and other Eastern and Central European countries that had

been subjected to the Soviet oppression. Accordingly, there was considerable domestic
pressure for Canada to act.3
By taking on the role of Framework Nation in the largest multilateral mission to contain
Russia since the end of the Cold War, Canada is signalling that NATO remains a top
defence priority. Among the four Framework Nations, Canada leads and integrates the most
multinational force while bolstering domestic resilience to counter Russian information
operations that endeavour to undermine the cohesion of the Alliance. Notwithstanding
challenges relating to sustained warfighting, domestic and political ambivalence about the
mission in Canada, the eFP’s Latvian Battle Group highlights the promise of effective
multilateral cooperation without direct US participation.

Setting up the eFP

Although Canada had played an important role in the International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan, there was a sense that the then Conservative government
under Stephen Harper eventually soured on NATO. Allies’ caveats often left Canada’s
Provincial Reconstruction Team in Kandahar exposed.4 Ottawa did not participate in the
post-ISAF Resolute Support mission and ended its contribution in the Airborne Warning
and Control System mission.
Since late 2015, however, Canada has reinforced its role in NATO, with its commitment
being most tangibly expressed in its role of eFP Framework Nation to Latvia. What explains
this assignment? The Afghanistan experience came in handy when deciding who would be
responsible for what state. The United Kingdom had already worked with Estonia, and
Germany with Lithuania. Poland has long had close defence and security relations with the
United States. This narrowed down the options to four potential states with the necessary
multinational headquarters capacity and experience to lead the mission in Latvia: France,
Spain, Italy, and Canada. France was already engaged in Mali and at home as part of antiterrorism activities. Spain was amidst an election without a government that had the legal
authority to commit. Italy was preoccupied with NATO’s southern flank.
Canada became the default. Eastern European allies wanted to see Canada commit to
the eFP in Latvia. Canada had already vowed to defend the interests of the Baltic states in
the event of an armed attack. Moreover, Operation Reassurance had enlisted a Canadian
presence in the region since April 2014, conducting exercises and interoperability training

in Poland and the Baltic states. Given Canada’s presence and experience in the region, Allies
anticipated that Ottawa would surely contribute. Importantly, the foreign policy articulated
by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau highlighted a renewed Canadian dedication to
multilateralism. In the words of a senior policy adviser, this dedication to multilateralism
resulted from “Trudeau’s brand of internationalism, which blends small l-liberal idealism
and interest-based realism”.5 It was clear from Justin Trudeau’s first interactions with
Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in 2015 that Canada would continue to oppose Russia’s
actions in Ukraine. The appointment of Chrystia Freeland as foreign minister in 2017,
given her unique understanding of Ukrainian culture and resolve to maintain the liberal
international order, further strengthened the perception that the Trudeau government
would stand by Eastern European NATO Allies.6 At the same time, this mission was
ready-made for Canada to mitigate persistent complaints from Washington about NATO
burden-sharing.
Indeed, Canada ended up being the last Framework Nation to be determined. Most
observers believe that the Stephen Harper government, which lost the October 2015
election, was reluctant to commit to another NATO mission. However, both “friends of
Canada” on the inside of NATO and President Barack Obama by direct phone conversation
with the Canadian Prime Minister advocated with the Canadian government to commit to
lead a multinational effort in Latvia.7 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg had also
requested Canada’s participation. One complication was the government’s concern that
a relatively large military undertaking – by Canadian standards – could hamper the newly
elected government’s promised commitment to return to peacekeeping by contributing,
for example, to the UN mission in Mali. Canada would not be able to sustain two major
missions in two different regions. However, a day after US President Obama explicitly
courted a larger NATO commitment from Canada in a speech before the Parliament
of Canada, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan announced Canada’s commitment as the eFP
Framework Nation for Latvia, stating: “Canada stands side by side with its NATO Allies
working to deter aggression and assure peace and stability in Europe”.8
Some 400 Canadian troops began deploying in early 2017, led by the Princess Patricia’s
Canadian Light Infantry. By February 2019, Battlegroup Latvia (BG LVA) consisted of

roughly 1,400 troops with eight participating NATO member states. Sizeable Spanish,
Polish, and Italian subcomponents featured prominently inside the Canadian battlegroup
as did smaller contingents from other European allies.
Canada now leads the most multinational battlegroup ever put together in the NATO
context below the level of a Brigade.9 Such a highly visible multilateral role nicely suits
Trudeau’s stated multilateralism. Seasoned observers surmised that the multinationalism of
BG LVA was the result of competing demands on a country with a modest defence budget
and thus relatively small pool of Canadian capacity and personnel. The mission provides
the Canadian Armed Forces and other established medium-sized NATO partners with
an opportunity to train with new and less capable member states. Canada is thus making
common cause to learn to work together and harness synergies as yet another way to
enhance burden-sharing within the Alliance: these countries, or a subset, might henceforth
be able to deploy more effectively on future missions.10
In May 2018 the Canadian government decided to renew its eFP lead nation role for
an unprecedented five years, until March 2023.11 It also increased the number of Canadian
troops from 455 to 540. The decision came a year before the existing commitment in
Latvia would run out.12 It reflects Ottawa’s concern for not only the situation in Latvia
and the eFP, but also the fate of NATO itself, Canada’s role in it, and, indeed, the future
of Canadian defence policy. In light of the highly critical public relations battle waged
by the White House over Allied defence spending, Ottawa had incentives to placate the
White House by doubling down on its current commitments. Hence Ottawa agreed to
lead NATO’s advise and assist mission to Iraq. Canada’s level of participation in NATO
missions had far exceeded its contribution to UN peacekeeping despite the new Liberal
government’s earlier musings about the latter.13 It took nearly two years for the Canadian
government to come through with its modest, six-month, time-limited contribution to the
UN mission in Mali – a commitment that ended in 2019.

Assessing the Canadian-led Latvia mission

The eFP deployment deters Russia by means of a multilateral allied military presence, but
as said in previous chapters of this volume, hesitation exists in calling it a tripwire force.
Latvian forces used to be augmented by small units of rapidly rotating US and NATO
forces. Now, there is a continuous multinational presence of more than 1,100 soldiers
composed of nine NATO Allies.
Multi-nationality poses a challenge to military efficiency, and thus the credibility of
deterrence. By spreading risk, however, it reinforces political deterrence, which is just as
important an offset. Canada’s leadership in the BG LVA has introduced a high tempo
of training as well as adaptive military diplomacy to enhance multinational cooperation.
Two times per year, BG LVA goes through a certification process, which is arguably more
stringent than in the other eFPs, to qualify as “fully integrated and battle ready”. This level
of interoperability below the brigade level is unprecedented in NATO.
Canada has also been dispelling Russian influence operations. Specifically, Russian
disinformation tactics have sought to delegitimate the eFP among the Russian-speaking
minority in Latvia. In the first year of the eFP, Russian-speaking media outlets accused
NATO troops of polluting the environment and inflating real estate prices. By 2019,
Russian-language attempts at disseminating false news had been on the wane. Information
attacks focussed on NATO in general rather than the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF)
mission. In 2020, however, COVID-19–related information attacks surged: CAF members
were allegedly bringing the virus to Latvia.14
Canadian countermeasures push out messages that debunk false claims that Russian
actors level against CAF members and the CAF mission in Latvia. The CAF works with
local authorities, such as the Latvian Ministry of Defence, to set the record straight on
troops spreading coronavirus. In collaboration with other NATO partners, the CAF
neutralizes false narratives with accurate counter-narratives. Although reactive and limited
in reach, Latvians seem to appreciate having the CAF in the country, notwithstanding
Russian efforts to convince them otherwise. CAF members prioritize engaging with locals
so that Latvians can understand the CAF presence and how CAF members measure up
against the negative narratives spread by Russia.15

Lessons from the Enhanced Forward Presence, 2017-2020

The extent to which Canada has been proactive in the battle of ideas for the hearts and
minds of the Latvian people is an important complement to effective military deterrence.
On the one hand, Canada set up Task Force Latvia headquarters (TFL HQ) in Riga with
continuous officers and staff to assure continuity of communication and progress across
battlegroup rotations. Housed in the Latvian Brigade’s HQ, it creates a permanent liaison.
Although the BG LVA rotates every six months, officers in the TFL HQ are typically on
three-year rotations. On the other, the Embassy, the TFL-HQ, and BG LVA have taken a
“whole-of-government” approach. Political, economic, and military actions and messages
are integrated and transmit the same themes. In terms of civil-military relations, the aim is
to thwart Russian claims that NATO is an occupier and to reassure Latvia’s ethnic Russian
minority that NATO does not threaten any aspect of Latvian society. It forges domestic
resilience in the face of persistent Russian influence operations by showing that NATO is
a good citizen that is ultimately there to help Latvia help itself. The message is taken across
Latvia to community and civil-society events.
All eFPs, including BG LVA, face the challenge of how NATO is capable of reinforcing
or retaliating should it be confronted by adversarial aggression. In terms of covert and
hybrid threats, the eFP is, of course, not the first responder. Still, the TFL is aware of
Latvian plans and ready to assist if called upon. In the case of a large-scale attack of
conventional forces on Latvia, the eFP task of “deterrence-by-denial” could be reinforced.
It needs sufficient deterrence effect so that “the punishment imposes costs on an adversary
that are greater than the adversary’s valuation of the gains through action”.16 NATO is
aware of vulnerabilities in reinforcing the Baltic missions. It must overcome the growing
Russian capacity to deny NATO access to redeploy forces from the centre to the periphery
of the Alliance on short notice. For the VJTF to support such a multinational battlegroup
as the one led by Canada is key to the eFP’s credible deterrence posture. To this effect,
NATO is setting up a wider division-level command and control structure as well as Joint
Support and enabling command and function nearer the geographical location of the eFPs.
The Canadian-led BG LVA draws on forces from eight contributing member states –
more than twice the contributing states than the other three eFP country deployments.
National forces have potentially conflicting rules of engagement and greater variation
in military equipment. Accordingly, the inability to pre-position VJTF equipment and
troops due to the diverse multinational structure of the eFP battlegroup in an area under
imminent or pending threat could prove to be a liability. As several security analysts warn,
“[t]he VJTF is not regionally aligned, so if a conflict in […] one area erupts at the same

time as another crisis requiring a NATO response, the VJTF might be unavailable”. The
overall combat readiness and capacity of the battlegroups risks being compromised or
relegated to “ineffective ‘Frankenstein’ battalions”.17 Although NATO is addressing these
problems and the Canadian-led battlegroup has added more firepower, Canada alone or in
conjunction with other Allies could do more to boost the conventional defence value of
its mission.
There is also room to enhance cooperation among the four battlegroups. Polish and
Lithuanian eFP forces exercise jointly, but others do not. Baltic regional defence cooperation
remains fragmented and falls short of realizing its full potential. The three Baltic eFPs could
do more to overcome the traditional and historic lack of military cooperation among Baltic
states. A recent report by an Estonian think tank observes: “there is a distinct impression
that none of the three Baltic states regard trilateral military cooperation as an absolute
priority, and that they only invoke its ideals as a matter of political ritual”.18 At one point,
each Baltic country’s priority was likely to work bilaterally with the United States. As of
late, there is a growing sense of each working with NATO. Absent a more robust effort
at multilateralism, the security architecture in the Baltic region risks assuming a hub-andspoke character that encourages strong ties between the United States and local partners
to the detriment of weak ties among themselves and among their respective Framework
Nations. Even the eFP battalions deployed in the Baltic region risk prioritizing bilateralism
between Framework and Host Nations at the expense of wider multilateralism among both
Host and Contributing Nations. For example, rather than Canada and Latvia being hub
nations within a multiplayer network, each has set up their defence relations as a hub-andspoke network between one another and each Contributing Nation. Doing so risks missing
opportunities to build military and political cohesion among subsets of NATO partners as
well as greater resiliency within the Alliance.
The eFP initiative in Latvia, therefore, should encourage the participating states
to overcome geographic divides, exchange lessons learned, and develop new skills and
expertise, as well as tactical synergies to increase common understanding and interoperability.
Enhanced cooperation offers a powerful rejoinder to the criticism that NATO countries
are insufficiently bearing the burden of collective and regional defence.
Canada’s actions in Latvia also can benefit from better exposure and support on the
domestic front. Canada’s government could be better at articulating how Canadian actions
in NATO advance both Canadian values and interests. The government is making this
case on the international stage but seems reluctant to do so at home. Canada’s ambitious

pace of NATO deployments in Latvia, Ukraine, and most recently in the training mission
in Iraq, and the operational requirements that come with them are only sustainable with
broad understanding and support from Canadians. An uninformed public and absence of
scholarly work accompanying Canadian policies in NATO leaves the Canadian government
orphaned in success or failure.19

Conclusion

Canada has committed itself to European security since the watershed year of 2014. Besides
the eFP mission in Latvia, Canada is involved with several NATO Allies in a training and
capacity-building mission with some 200 troops in Ukraine. A Canadian ship regularly
patrols with the two Standing Maritime Groups assigned to the NATO Response Force.
Four or five CF-18 fighter jets take turns with various Allies in NATO air policing missions
in the Baltic states and Romania.20 In 2018, Canada agreed to lead the NATO training
mission in Iraq, which now includes some 250 personnel.21 By its active participation in
so many missions, Canada is pushing back on the perception that NATO is yesterday’s
alliance. To the contrary, NATO remains Canada’s most important multilateral institution
precisely because it acts as a force multiplier for Canada’s core interests.
As it doubles down on NATO, Canada now has a greater stake in making NATO’s
positions tenable. In Latvia, this includes boosting NATO’s political and military deterrence
value through robust forward defence and demonstrating that the Alliance is resolute in
countering aggression against its members. The Latvia eFP mission also allows Canada to
optimize inter-operational synergies for future collective deployments elsewhere: a military
and political mini-Alliance within the Alliance. Ostensibly, that not only advances burdensharing, but also raises Canada’s leverage in decision-making in the North Atlantic Council
about future deployments. Influence in higher allied councils has long been a justification
for and assumption about Canadian military commitments, but, except for the early 1950s,
Ottawa has never committed sufficient troops to influence allied decision-making since it
never really had a distinct policy agenda for which to press. Canada is, however, capitalizing
on its expertise in civil-military relations in the Latvia mission. As adversarial influence
operations become a staple of the regional and global threat environment, expertise in
societal resilience is bound to be in high demand.
