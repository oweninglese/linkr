Making Space for Property
Nicholas Blomley
Department of Geography, Simon Fraser University

A modern-day treaty process in British Columbia, Canada, involving First Nations1 and the federal and provincial

governments, entails a struggle to carve out both metaphoric and material space for indigenous land and title.
Despite considerable opposition, the state has insisted that First Nations will hold their treaty lands as a form of
"fee simple," this being the way most private property owners hold property, granting broad rights to access, use,

and alienation. This is said to generate what the state terms certainty, a concept predicated on the idea of property

as a priori, singular, and definite. I explore the resultant contest through a performative lens that treats property

not as essence, but as effect. Tracing the complicated ways in which fee simple is performed in the treaty process

reveals that fee simple is anything but. Multiple, competing, and overlapping fee simples are in circulation.
The identification of this multiplicity offers valuable lessons for our understanding of the contemporary space of

postcolonial reconciliation. Key Words: common law, critical legal geography, performativity, property, reconciliation.

The archive reveals the tortured navigation of the

classificatory "torque" (Bowker and Star 1999, 225), or
a profound mismatch between individual biographies

here. This was made powerfully clear to me at a meet

not exhaust all categories of land tenure." Yet many
First Nations negotiators continued to be suspicious.
At a 2005 meeting of Treaty Negotiators, a Vancouver
Island First Nations negotiator noted: "We have always
felt that with the accepting of the fee-simple lands,

the aboriginal title is extinguished. We don't want
to extinguish [our aboriginal title]. We feel like the
Nisga'a did extinguish" (Minutes, First Nations Treaty
Negotiators Alliance meeting, 18 February 2005, 13,
HTG Archive).
James Aldridge, counsel for Nisga'a during their ne
gotiations, expressed frustration to me at this view and

the related argument that fee simple was foisted on
N isga'a. Rather, he insisted, the question of landholding
was something negotiated from the ground up, involv

ing considerable exploration with all parties (Blackburn
2005). It emerged following the agreement-in-principle
stage, which stated that Nisga'a would own its lands. As
Aldridge put it, the provincial negotiator subsequently
came to him and said, "We need to discuss that clause
because the clause is not clear as to the nature of the

ownership. So, when you say you own Nisga'a lands,
you own it howV (J. Aldridge, counsel for Nisga'a, tele

added). Aldridge explored various alternatives—it was
sui generis, it was a form of allodial title, it was Aborigi

nal title—but these were determined to be vacuous, too

known as the fee sirnple plus model, which the Crown
adopted in the treaty process to attempt to soothe First
Nations' concerns.

But what is the source of the fee simple? Is this not
a Crown grant? Aldridge noted that the land section ot
the Treaty describes the interest but is studiously silent
on this point: "Read the treaty from back to front, read
the statutes from back to front, go look in the land
titles office, you will not see anything anywhere that
says that the Nisga'a Lands were granted to it by the
Crown" (J. Aldridge, telephone interview with author,
24 May 2011). A fee simple, he argued, is to be defined
according to its content, not according to its source.
The inclusion of a clause that Nisga'a Aboriginal title
"continues as modified" into the fee simple, he argued,
ensures that "the link with the ancestral inheritance is

not severed and there's no grant and what the Nisga'a
end up with is everything there is."
This lawyerly juggling of the "legal architecture,"

as he described it, entailed the reworking of legal
fictions: "Because this is all legal fiction, it's all legal
metaphysics—but to say that it's a fiction is of course
not to say it's unimportant" (J. Aldridge, telephone

interview with author, 24 May 2011). The technical
magic of Crown allodial title, he noted, was one that
Nisga'a reperformed through a legal-geographic move.

were different, given the prior existence of Aboriginal
title that is irrefutably not derived from a Crown grant.
