### #US #health #officials warn of #false-positives with #lab test for #COVID-19 and #flu

#### [[general topics/PLACES/WASHINGTON]] â€” 
**[[U.S.]] [[health officials]] are warning [[health professionals]] about the risk of [[false positive]] results with a widely used laboratory test for[[ COVID-19]] and [[flu]].**

[[The Food and Drug Administration]] issued the alert to Friday for health facilities using [[Roche's cobas test]] for [[coronavirus]] and [[seasonal flu]]. The agency warned that problems with the test's processing tubes could result in [[false diagnosis]] in people who are not actually #infected.

Roche's testing system is widely used to screen large batches of #patient samples in hospitals and laboratories.

The #FDA recommends #health workers test samples multiple times to help assure #accuracy. If the test delivers conflicting #results it may indicate a problem and use should be #discontinued, the #agency says.
