SETTLEMENT OF THE CLAIMS IN WASHINGTON OF
THE HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY AND THE PUGET'S
SOUND AGRICULTURAL COMPANY

The claims of the Hudson's Bay Company and the Puget's

Sound Agricultural Company were first recognized by the United
States in the Treaty of 18461 between Great Britain and the United
States, as negotiated and arranged by James Buchanan, Secretary
of State for the United States, and Right Honorable Richard Pak-

enham, member of the British Privy Council and Envoy Extr
ordinary and Minister Plenitrotentiary to the United States. A
ticles II, III and IV are those in which the companies' claims ar
recognized by the United States. The articles are in substance
follows :

Article II. Free navigation, to the Hudson's Bay Cmpany, of

the Columbia River and its tributaries from point where the 49th
degree of latitude crosses the Grand Eddy, the great northern bran
of the Columbia, to the Pacific Ocean.

Article III. Confirmation of the possessory rights of the Hudson's Bay Company south of 49°, within the territory of the Unite
States.

Article IV. Confirmation to the Puget's Sound Agricultura

Company of farms, lands and other property belonging to the com

pany, north of the Columbia River and to the United States t

right to take it at a proper valuation to be agreed on between the
two parties concerned, if the property becomes of "public and po
litical importance to the United States."

From 1848 to 1863, when a treaty was made with England for
the settlement of the claims,2 many requests were made to Congre
to buy these possessory rights of the two companies. On July 10
1848, Sir George Simpson, on behalf of the Hudson's Bay Compan
let it be known/ to Congress that the company was anxious to se
because of England's fear of disputes over the rights, which migh
lead to differences between the nations; hence, the company was
willing to sacrifice its rights for $l,000,000.3 In the same year, in
answer to a resolution of the Senate, on July 31st, President Polk

message to Congress included a report of the Secretary of Sta

the United States Government and the British Crown.6 On October

11, 1850 Sir William Pelly wrote to Daniel Webster, Secretary of
State, to the effect that seizure by United States military officers
of the Hudson's Bay Company's vessel and store at Nisqually (really
the property of the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company, a company subsidiary to the Hudson's Bay Company and often included
under the term Hudson's! Bay Company7) hastened the necessity for
transferring possessory rights to the United States; that part of
the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company's land was already occupied by United States' troops, so was of public and political importance to the United States ; that the purchase price was not so important and that it would be advisable to leave the price to the judgment of two parties, - one appointed by the United States and one

by the Hudson's Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies,
who should call in a third party as umpire should they not agree.8
It is interesting to note that this was the plan later provided by the
Treaty of 1863.*
Twice the Legislature of Oregon Territory, on July 20, 1849
and again January 6, 1851, sent memorials to Congress to purchase
the claims since the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company was resisting the efforts of American settlers to locate on the unenclosed
lands10 to which the company, according to the legislature, had no
right.11

The report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
November 26, 1851, mentioned the necessity of the Surveyor Gen-

eral of Oregon's obtaining from the companies evidence of the
rights they may claim to be protected by the Treaty of 1846 and evidence of the original localities and boundaries of the same, which

they held at the time of the treaty. The report recommended that
provision be made by Congress for "prompt summary and final adjustment of the said claims in order that all within the purview of
the treaty may be respected ; and the United States protected from
any not within its stipulations."12

The memorial of the Washington Legislature to Congress in
1854 asked Congress to ascertain the rights of the company and to
purchase them, since the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company had
commanded American settlers to vacate unenclosed lands over which

the company's herds occasionally roamed, although these same
settlers had improved this land.13

Governor I. I. Stevens of Washington Territory, in 1854, said
that the company claimed the right of felling timber in the forests,
of grazing large tracts of unenclosed pasture and prairie land with
immense herds of cattle and flocks of sheep.

In his third annual message to Congress, December 31, 1855,
President Franklin Pierce mentioned misunderstanding as to the extent, character, and value of the possessory rights of the Hudson's

Bay and Puget's Sound Agricultural Companies and, to terminate
the question, advocated cession to the United States of the rights
of both companies, which could be obtained at reasonable terms. He
asked for Congress' attention to the subject.14
On, August 14, 1864, A. G. Henry, Surveyor General of Washington Territory, evidently not having received news of the negotiating of the treaty of July 1, 1863, in a letter to J. M. Edmunds,
Commissioner of the General Landi Office, Washington, D.C., called
attention to the necessity for a survey of the lands of the Puget's
Sound Agricultural "Society," at that time occupied by more than
one thousand settlers, many of whom had made large and valuable
improvements in the land. He added that the whole Territory was
annoyed by conflicts between the American settlers and the company

and asked for prompt and decisive interference by the United
States government.15

In answer to these many requests, came the treaty of July 1,
1863, between Great Britain and the United States, providing, since

it was desirable to transfer the companies' claims to the United
States, for the appointment of commissioners by each country with12 Executive Documents 32nd C. 1st S. p. 7.

III. Possessory rights were of the value stated in the memorial.
IV. That the United States not only had failed to protect the
Hudson's Bay Company's rights but United States officers and citizens under authority of United States government had violated and
usurped them.
V. That the United States was now liable to the Hudson's Bay
Company for the highest value of the rights at any time between
1846 and the producing of the claim in 1865, and that this value
ought to be the right amount to be awarded.22
After due consideration Commissioner Rose declared that he

was bound to adopt the conclusion that, since the functions of the
commissioners were limited to the third and fourth articles of the

Treaty of 1846, any right of navigation secured by article II of the
Oregon Treaty was beyond the jurisdiction of their commission.28
This left; only the question of the trading rights and the value of
the posts and establishments, for consideration by the Commission.
There was a great divergence in the acreage also in the valuation of the possessory rights as figured by the companies and by the
witnesses for the United States, as well as differences in the valuation given by the companies at different dates. For example, the
Earl of Berens in a letter to the Earl of Clarendon in 1857, stated
that the assessor's books listed the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company's property at $670,000 ;24 in 1865 the company was claiming
$l,168,000.25 The possessory rights of this company principally included, according to its memorial to the Joint International Commission, a tract at Nisqually of 167,000 acres and a farm at Cowlitz River of about 3,572 acres. Governor I. I. Stevens of Washing-

ton Territory in a report, in 1854, to Secretary of State Marcy
valued the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company's rights, which included, according to the claims of the company in 1854, enclosed

and unenclosed pasture and prairie land to the amount of 8,000
acres for Cowlitz farm and 800 square miles for Nisqually territory,
at $180,000 and the Hudson's Bay Company's rights at $120,000 of

$300,000 for the entire claim.26 The $1,168,000 for the Puget's
Sound Agricultural Company, as quoted above, included $50,000 for

litz, Chinook, Okanagan, Colville, Kootanais and Flat-Heads were
still, in 1865, in the hands of the Hudson's Bay Company.33

As to offers made before 1865, the United States offered to
pay $1,000,000 for the Hudson's Bay Company's rights, including
the right to navigation of the Columbia. This was expressed in a

convention prepared by Daniel Webster in 1852.34 On the other
hand, the Hudson's Bay Company, through Mr. Lyons, in 1860
agreed to accept $500,000 in full of their demands.34
Since the evidence of the claimant's witnesses made claims con-

siderably in excess of the sum the company was once ready to accept, and the evidence adduced by the United States reduced the
claims to an insignificant sum,34 Mr. Rose, anxious not to prevent
settlement,34 made the award $450,000 for the Hudson's Bay Com-

pany and $200,000 for the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company,
or $650,000 in all. The same award was made by Mr. Johnson.
The sum of $650,000 was to be paid by the United States to the
government of Great Britain as specified in the Treaty of 1863.
Before payment, or at the time of, each company was to deliver
to the United States a sufficient deed or transfer and release, the
form for which was annexed to the award. Thus the award was

made by the Joint International Commission on September 10,
1869.35

On December 6, 1869, President Grant notified Congress of the
award, of the extinguishing of the titles and rights of the company
to territory in the United States and of the delivery of the deeds
for the property of this company; and asked for an appropriation
by Congress to meet the award of $650,000.36

On March 24, 1870, Hamilton Fish, Secretary of State called
the attention of George Boutwell, Secretary of the Treasury, to the
fact that the first installment of the award would become payable on
September 10, 1870, according to the Treaty of 1863.37 Two days
later, the Secretary of the Treasury in a letter to James G. Blaine,
Speaker of the House, asked for an appropriation to pay this part
of the award.37 This was accordingly appropriated and the first installment paid by the United States as stipulated.38

The second payment on the award was m

dent of the United States to communicate to the House the reasons

for the violating of the proviso of the act of February 21, 1871.80
However the Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, had been fully persuaded before September 10, 1871, the date upon which the second
payment was due, that the taxes of $50,000 assessed by Pierce County, Washington, against the Puget's Sound Agricultural Company

was not the one referred to by Congress since the United States
could only assess Federal taxes, according to an opinion rendered
by Justice A. T. Akerman, Department of Justice, in a letter to Sec-

retary Fish on August 7, 187 1.40 Mr. Fish also received from J.
H. Hartley, acting Secretary of Treasury, on September 2, 1871, a
copy of a letter from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, J. W.

Douglas, stating that no taxes had been legally assessed and remained unpaid to the United States on property of the Puget's
Sound Agricultural Company up to the time of the award in 1869.41
