As an Anishinaabe person myself, who works directly with First Nation communities, reddit has been a truly disgusting hateful place for speaking the truth.

especially in this sub. I see so much performative action taken on the daily by these self proclaimed “allies”.

no one has yet to actually come forward and demand actionable change, these same allies in this thread question the TRC calls to action all the time. I see constant denial of genocide, I see constant assumptions made about our peoples and the burning of churches, as if that has nothing to do with these churches burning evidence.

I get attacked on the daily anytime I speak up, I get told “that’s not racist” constantly here.

I get told to shut the fuck up, i get told that I am anti-white when I call you guys out on how your actions have maintained white supremacy.

I get told to watch my tone, i get silenced all the time. This place is filled with token white-ntvs and people that love to claim their heritage and over speak everyone else.

you allies get so offended anytime we actually try to hold you accountable, you guys say shit like reverse racism exists, you claim that white fragility and guilt is oppressing you, you claim that you’re not responsible for OCCUPYING STOLEN LAND, you act like the same systems that your ancestors helped built aren’t still around and enforced today. you act like you don’t still benefit from the killings of out children.

this sub actively oppresses any NTV voice that doesn’t give settlers a pat on the fucking back for being performative as shit.

I don’t give a single fuck what non-for profit Indig org you work for, it’s again not your duty to thank settlers in our language who actively oppress our communities and our peoples daily.

but go ahead, be a token. uplift these white supremacists and make them feel good for doing the ABSOLUTE BARE FUCKING MINIMUM.

If these allies knew anything, they wouldn’t be engaging in reddit to discuss NTV issues. How many NDN lead orgs are funded directly by the government to do the opposite of helping their communities.

I won’t stand by and let these same racist liberal fucks feel good about themselves when this community is silent as can be on THE MURDER OF OUR BABIES AND ACTIVELY DEFENDS WHITE SUPREMACY.

FUCK CANADA.

just prove my point, lmao blame an angry NDN who’s actually speaking the truth, go ahead tell me and my people how “that’s not how you approach people if you want change”…

it’s honestly so pathetic, y’all have changed nothing. our children are still being murdered and stolen, our lands are still being stolen, THE INDIAN ACT STILL EXISTS. YOU ALL BENEFIT FROM IT. WE HAVE TO SUFFER FROM YOUR IGNORANCE AND DENIAL.

the second we call for action, you guys have lived your entire life with so much privilege that when we demand equality, it feels like fucking oppression to you guys.

that’s fucking disgusting.

you guys have benefited for so long from oppressing Indigenous people and the second one has something to say that doesn’t give you allyship points you immediately get defensive and attack them.

Can’t wait to see all the token ntvs, especially the white-ntvs come to y’all’s defence to cuddle y’alls white fragility.

You guys love to point to token ndn’s that get paid a pretty cheque to not address white supremacy.

remember that before you speak over and silence us again.

remember that next time these churches burn evidence and y’all accuse us of burning down the places we are sacred of, because we hold our ceremonies, weddings and gatherings at these places. we can separate a fucking colonial place from the white supremacy it enforces.

what the fuck are you waiting for? why isn’t the DEATH OF A THOUSAND BABIES at the top of this subs page?

this same page uplifted canada day, celebrating white supremacy and colonialism…

get fucked you dirty fucking performative yt pieces of utter trash, and fuck you token ndn’s for defending white supremacy.

learn from this, it’s not a ntvs job to cuddle your guilt, it’s not our job to teach you about how you actively benefit from oppressing us.

it’s your job to end white supremacy.

LIVE WITH IT YOU FUCKING PRICKS, DEMAND CHANGE, YOU ALL HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS.

FUCK CANADA, it’s an active colonial terrorist state.

YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF.

THE THINGS THAT MAKE CANADA GREAT, ALL EXISTED BEFORE COLONIALISM.

“GeT OvEr It”… lmfao… racists.
