NATIVE AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TREATY
RIGHTS: ARE THEY HISTORICAL ILLUSIONS?
Robert A. Fairbanks*

Introduction
Native American peoples, and their governments, steadfastly claim they
possess "sovereignty." Moreover, they vociferously demand that local, state

and federal governments honor and respect their sovereignty. However,
given the conservative political climate that has swept the United States,
Native American peoples can expect strong challenges to the sovereignty of
their governments. These challenges will be resilient and imaginative. They

will take many forms and come from expected and unexpected sources. In
turn, Native American peoples, and their governments, must be prepared to

repel these attacks. Otherwise, they can expect continued erosion of their
sovereignty and pendent treaty rights.

Sovereign Capacity
A claim of sovereignty implies ability and willingness to exercise the
supreme powers of government. Therefore, assuming a sufficient population

and adequate land base, the inquiry becomes whether Native American
governments possess the institutional capacity to exercise jurisdiction over
the population resident on reservation territory.1

Inspection reveals that Native American governments, in fact, are able
to exercise very little sovereign power over people ? native and non-native
alike ? residing within, or merely passing through, reservation boundaries.

According to federal law, a tribal government cannot prosecute a non
reservation member for a crime committed within the boundaries of its

reservation no matter how heinous or trivial.2 Moreover, a tribal
government cannot even prosecute a reservation member for murder, rape,
robbery or any other felony.3 The revealing truth is that tribal governments

are incapable of exercising the police power of government within the
boundaries of their reservations, except in minor, almost insignificant ways.
It is inescapable, therefore, that most Native American governments have
no police power over the majority of people within the boundaries of their

reservations. For example, Leech Lake Reservation in north central
Minnesota is populated by nearly 10,000 individuals; only about 3700 of the
reservation residents are members of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe.4
Most reservations across the country are similarly situated.
Similarly, it is doubtful that tribal governments can effectively regulate

land use within their reservation boundaries. There is little question that
tribal government can enact zoning regulations for land held by reservation

members on the reservation. However, on many, if not most, reservations
the vast majority of land is owned by non-reservation members. Again
using Leech Lake Reservation as an example, only about 30,000 of over
677,000 acres is owned by a reservation member or the tribal government.5
Therefore, tribal government's ability to regulate use of reservation land is,

indeed, negligible.
Foregoing consideration of other indicia of sovereign power for now,6
it becomes apparent Native American governments exercise little in the way

of legitimate sovereign power. Moreover, mere casual inquiry reveals that
by and large the governmental powers actually exercised by contemporary
tribal governments are those gratuitously granted by the federal government.

Those powers are found in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934,7 an act
of the United States Congress. Besides being severely limited in scope,
those powers can be amended, or eliminated for that matter, at the whim of

Congress. Thus the sovereign powers exercised by contemporary tribal
governments are more illusion than real.

Even more significantly, the Self-Determination and Educational
Assistance Act8 is also illusory. In substance, self-determination under the
Act means no more than permission to administer housing, education,
health, and community development and other programs of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and the Public Health Service. Moreover, administration of
those programs must conform to the rules, regulations and guidelines of the

federal government. Furthermore, reservation casinos ? the alleged
economic salvation of the Native American peoples ? are subject to

extensive federal regulation and reluctant state acquiescence.9 Given federal

plenary power,10 Native American self-determination and sovereignty are
illusory.

Federal plenary power notwithstanding, the rancorous chorus of
"inherent" sovereignty is often heard. Does tribal government have any
political capacity independent of the federal government? Much insight into

this question can be gained by examining the political maturity of Native
American governments.
By analogy, governments are just like people. The sovereignty powers
of governments can be compared to citizenship rights of individuals. For
instance, when a child is first brought into this world, it is totally dependent
upon its parents for survival. If the parents do not feed, clothe and shelter

the child, it will soon die. But, if the child is appropriately nurtured, it will

grow physically, emotionally and intellectually, and it may eventually
acquire the worldly skills necessary to survive in the community in which
it finds itself.

In this final developmental stage, an individual adult will acquire some
degree of capacity to engage in the spectrum of human endeavor; in varying

degrees some will be dependent upon government for food, shelter and
clothing and others will be fully independent. Similarly, Native American
peoples, and their governments, need to determine where on the scale of
political maturity they find themselves. Many, if not most, will find
themselves dependent upon the Great White Father in Washington, D.C.
Political Maturity and Meeting the Challenge
The only scrap of sovereignty Native American peoples can claim with
certitude emanates from the authority of the United States Congress which

passed the Indian Reorganization Act of 1932.11 This act permitted Native
American peoples to form "reservation business committees" to conduct
their limited affairs with the local, state and federal governments. Although
now often called "Reservation Tribal Councils," the form and power of the
business committee has changed little since 1932 and the exercise of such
power, in large measure, remains subject to approval by Bureau of Indian
Affairs officials.

The salient point here is that the business committees can be eliminated
by Congress very simply. And given the misconduct of many elected tribal

officials and the general ineffectiveness of tribal government,12 coupled

144 AMERICAN INDIAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 20
with the political conservatives' desire to slash the cost of federal
government and their perception that huge casino profits abound, the vestige
of sovereignty exercised by Native American peoples is endangered, indeed.

For the most part, tribal governments appear ill-prepared to rebut
challenges to their sovereignty. For example, tribal governments have
generally proven incapable of dealing with self-serving and corrupt elected

tribal officials. This critical institutional weakness alone may hasten the
demise of tribal sovereignty. Similarly, former Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal

Chairman Frank Ducheneaux has observed that "today tribal leaders pay
little attention to the Constitution and by-laws governing them and they
have no knowledge of the history of their tribe, treaties and acts of
Congress."13 There are exceptions, of course, but generally tribal leaders,
for reasons including little formal education, lack political sophistication and
are ill-prepared to deal effectively with local, state and federal government

officials.

To secure and protect the residual treaty rights of native peoples, Native
American governments must begin a swift march toward political maturity

and economic independence. To do otherwise will insure the demise of
distinct Native American "body politics" and amount to complicity in the
historical federal policy of termination.

Acknowledging much federal Indian law rests on questionable political

logic, Notre Dame Professor Sharon O'Brien instructs that "[t]ribal
governments and individuals must not simply accept the federal
government's interpretation of their rights and status. Laws, regulations, and
court decisions that limit tribal sovereignty must be questioned and carefully

challenged."14 In other words, if Native American governments are truly
"inherently" sovereign, they will, and must, assert their rights of citizenship
in the community of sovereign governments.

However, tribal governments must be able and willing to accept the

responsibility of governing. Questions abound about whether tribal
governments, given their often dictatorial, nonseparation of powers structure

and the ill-preparedness of many elected tribal officials, are capable of
assuming such responsibility. Furthermore, Native American peoples must
ask themselves, given the historic and contemporary performance of their

governments, whether they want their governments to assume such
responsibility. This inquiry may not be particularly encouraging.

Pemberton, Secretary-Treasurer Myron Ellis and reservation attorney Harold Finn were convicted

of multiple felony counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and theft of reservation funds, and

Treasurer Jerry Rawley and Representative Rich Clark were similarly convicted.

No. 1] SOVEREIGNTY & TREATY RIGHTS 145
The litmus test of Native American tribal sovereignty is whether Native

American governments would whither and die if all non-treaty-mandated
federal monies were withdrawn in response to sustained assertions of
sovereignty? The answer would reveal the magnitude of any disparity

between persistent claims of sovereignty and the ability to perform
sovereign responsibilities.

Loss of Native Languages and Sovereignty
As if the foregoing challenges are not daunting enough, there is another,

more fundamental, matter that must be addressed if Native American
sovereignty is to survive in any reasonable, recognizable form. While it
may not be readily apparent to the casual observer, the loss of native
languages is by far the greatest threat to Native American sovereignty.

Federal policy makers have known the political significance of Native
American languages for ages and, consequently, made eradication of native
languages a priority in the boarding schools of yesteryear. As a result, a
scant few individuals under the age of thirty can speak the native tongue of
their ancestors today. Furthermore, history teaches that when a language is
no longer heard, cultural distinctiveness soon fades from view.

Perhaps Captain Richard Henry Pratt, who founded Carlisle Indian
School, the first boarding school for Indians, expressed the government's
assimilation policy best when he said, "In Indian civilization I am a Baptist,

because I believe in immersing the Indians in our civilization and when we
get them under holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked"15 The

Indian's baptism was swift and the Western civilization catechism was
earnestly taught. Today, conversion from ancient traditional teachings is
nearly complete, and Native American sovereignty is rapidly becoming a
historical matter.
Other than cultural nostalgia, native languages are important because they

provide cultural distinctiveness and identification of a "people." As Ojibwe
writer and artist Larry Cloud-Morgan has said, "The language is the people;

the language is the people!"16 In other words, for a "people" to exist they
must be distinguishable in some significant way. And, the important point
here is that there is no "sovereignty" if there is no "people."

Before Native American people can claim any measure of sovereignty
according to international law, they must exist as a distinct people that
occupy certain territory and they must have a government that is capable of

exercising jurisdiction over both the territory and the people and the

capacity to relate to other sovereign entities.17 It is evident, in a strict
sense, that Native American peoples' claim to international sovereignty is,
indeed, tenuous. Few would argue that Native American governments are
capable of, for example, maintaining international intercourse in the
community of nations or capable of training and equipping an effective
military defense establishment.
Nonetheless, the "inherent" sovereignty refrain is heard time and again
on every reservation across the country. The measure of this "inherent"
governmental power must begin with the identification of a culturally
distinct people and as native languages relentlessly march toward death such
identification becomes increasingly problematic. Simply put, if there is not

a living language, there is no distinctive people; there is no inherent
sovereignty.

What are Native American peoples to do? Assuming the cries of

"inherent" sovereignty are earnest, then Native American peoples must make
the revitalization of their languages and the reinvigoration of their cultural

distinctiveness their highest priorities. Moreover, they must take
responsibility for language revival into their own hands. Waiting for the
federal government or eleemosynary foundations to provide the resources
will only hasten extinguishment of Native American sovereignty.
The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. "At the present rate of

decline, it is doubtful the Ojibwe language will survive another
generation,"18 Canadian Ojibwe scholar Cecil King recently stated. If King
is correct, the Ojibwe proclamation of sovereignty may well fall on deaf
ears. Native American peoples should examine their language situation
carefully and act accordingly; their very existence as a distinct, sovereign

people depends on it. Otherwise, their descendants will have to read history

books to learn about the "Great Indian Nations."

Erosion of Pendent Treaty Rights
Of the many major issues facing Native American peoples today, none
is more volatile and divisive than the question of "treaty rights." Many
Americans, inspired by the contemporary conservative political climate,
vociferously protest the exercise of treaty rights by Native Americans. Even
so, Native Americans have achieved some success in protecting their treaty

rights. Nonetheless, there has been, and there will continue to be,
significant erosion of Native American treaty rights. Why is this so?
The various Native American nations negotiated and executed over three
hundred treaties with the United States of America before Congress declared

in March 1871 that "no Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United
States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or
power with whom the United States may contract by treaty . . . ,"19 Since the
Constitution requires Senate "advise and consent" to treaties negotiated by the
executive branch of government, the congressional enactment amounted to

notice to Native Americans that no additional "Indian" treaties would be
ratified and they would no longer have equal contracting status under federal

domestic law. Presidential approval of this congressional action indicated
agreement with this theretofore unprecedented federal policy. Clearly,
Congress had concluded that the various Native American peoples no longer
deserved, or required, the recognition or respect of a sovereign personality.
Prior to this enactment, all Native American treaties were considered and
approved in accordance with constitutional provisions. This irrefutable fact,

coupled with the 1871 Act, was explicit recognition that Native American
treaties negotiated prior to March 1871, were of the same international
character as treaties between the United States and other foreign nation
states and, importantly, acquired the municipal status as the supreme law of

the land. In recognition of this obligation, Congress ratified the legal
viability of the outstanding treaties by providing that "no obligation of any
treaty lawfully made and ratified with any . . . Indian nation or tribe prior

to March 3, 1871, shall be . . . invalidated or impaired."20 However, due
to the expansionist forces of Manifest Destiny and ostensible capitalistic
greed, the efficacy of the Native American treaties was soon called into
question; they have not enjoyed the same, or equal, treatment as other
treaties.21

This disparate situation has been a source of considerable disagreement
and friction between the United States, the various States and the various

Native American peoples and has raised the inevitable question of the
practical (vice legal) efficacy of the treaties. Native American peoples
maintain that their treaties ought to be honored as solemn contracts between

nations. The various States, seemingly at the behest of special interest
groups, consistently refuse or neglect to honor treaty provisions.
In order to address this disparity, the contemporary force and effect of

Indian treaties must be decided. Thus, it is necessary to determine what
measure of sovereignty power is retained, if any, by the various Native
American governments. Although many observe that Native American
governments appear incapable of independent existence and, therefore, any
treaty rights they may have held are extinguished, individual Indian nations

148 AMERICAN INDIAN LA W REVIEW [Vol. 20
still regard themselves as independent, sovereign nations "inherently"
capable of political and economic intercourse with the United States and the

various States. Their position is supported by the decision of the United
States Supreme Court in United States v. Winans22 decided shortly after
the turn of the century. The Winans court determined that the Indian treaty
under consideration "was not a grant of rights to the Indians, but a grant of

rights from them ? a reservation of those (rights) not granted."23 This
case confirms the principle that Indian nations keep, or reserve, certain
rights and powers not granted by treaty to the United States and that some

measure of sovereignty is retained.
Given the 1871 congressional ratification and the subsequent recognition
by the Winans Court, why do the various States so uniformly fail to honor

treaty provisions at nearly every opportunity? Perhaps it is because the

Supreme Court has declared Native American governments as being
"domestic dependent nations."24 Or, as Native American scholar Vine
Deloria, Jr., has argued, that the various Indian nations ought to seek the
status of an international protectorate under the tutelage of the United
States.25 These two positions are implicit recognition that Native American
peoples, and their governments, have lost contractual, treaty-making parity

with the United States.

The most telling factor, however, is that Native American governments
lack sufficient institutional strength to require the various States, or the
federal government for that matter, to come to the bargaining table
whenever treaty disputes arise. To obtain any relief at all, they are required
to resort to the courts, and the law, of the United States. The various States

recognize this apparent institutional weakness and act accordingly.
Why do the various States perceive this apparent institutional weakness?
Perhaps an analogous situation will be enlightening. Consider what happens
when Mr. Smith grants title to his land to Mr. Jones, but reserves the right
to use the land during the remainder of his life. When Mr. Smith dies, there
is absolutely no question his right to use the land is extinguished. After all,
he is dead. By analogy, if the sovereign life of a Native American people
dies, so does their reserved treaty rights. Many Americans believe "Indian"
sovereignty is a simple matter of American history and, therefore, the
reserved treaty rights have been extinguished.
Other Americans, especially the politically conservative, believe allowing
Native Americans to have special privileges, e.g., hunting and fishing rights
on ceded territory, is un-American. After, all, they argue, all "Americans"

have equal rights under the law. Because of these perceptions, Native
American peoples can expect continued challenges to the exercise of their
treaty rights.

Conclusion
Native American peoples continue to face significant challenges to the
sovereignty which they have so steadfastly claimed. These challenges come

from within ? through the loss of language and culture ? and without ?
from local, state, and federal political forces. To counter these challenges,

Native American peoples must act decisively to insure their governments
demonstrate the institutional quality of inherently sovereign political
personalities. Otherwise they can expect politically conservative Americans

to persist in their ridicule of Native American treaty rights. Moreover,

failure to do so with all deliberate speed will complete the intent of
Congress expressed in March 1871.
Whether Native American peoples, and their governments, are
sufficiently resilient to survive even another generation or so remains to be

seen. The challenges are certainly formidable.
