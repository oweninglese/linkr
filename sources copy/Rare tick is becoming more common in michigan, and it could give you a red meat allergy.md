There’s a relatively new kind of tick showing up in greater numbers in parts of Michigan and, for some people, it could cause a strange meat allergy if it bites you.

While the lone star tick has been found in big numbers in Indiana, until a few years ago Michigan typically would only get a few reports of this type of tick each year. But all that’s changed in the last three years, researchers say. More lone star ticks have been found moving into Michigan.

Jean Tsao, associate professor in the departments of Fisheries & Wildlife and Large Animal Clinical Sciences at Michigan State University, has been sampling favored tick habitats in Michigan since 2004. She, along with graduate student Peter Fowler, who works in Comparative Medicine and Integrative Biology at MSU, say counts are showing a large increase in the lone star tick population.

To survey an area for tick infestation, Tsao and Fowler drag a large cloth through the wet, leafy areas of woodlands, and then count the number of ticks on the cloth. They more importantly count the number of each type of tick found.

The tick-counting team has noted a remarkable increase in the number of lone star ticks. Tsao says between 2004 and 2018, just five adult lone star ticks were found in her active surveillance and counting of ticks. In 2019, Tsao and Fowler found five ticks at just one site - Warren Dunes State Park near Sawyer, Michigan. Last year’s monitoring was difficult with the pandemic, but Tsao’s team found 10 adult lone star ticks, 32 nymphal stage and 409 lavae. Tsao says finding all three life stages of the lone star tick probably means the lone star tick is now breeding successfully in southwest Lower Michigan.

The research and counting started up again on May 25. In just one day of sampling, 19 lone star tick nymphs were found.

What do they look like? Only the lone star female is distinctive, with a white spot on its back that some say is similar to the shape of the state of Texas.

**Warmer Winters Play a Role**

Tsao says the lone star tick is probably not as cold hardy as some of the more common ticks in Michigan, like the dog tick and the black-legged tick. She cites an example of the tick’s movement out of the eastern part of the United States. More than 20 years ago, the lone star tick was found in large numbers on Long Island. It’s taken all this time for this type of tick to move from Long Island to Connecticut, just 15 miles away. Tsao thinks it’s probably the colder winters in Connecticut that have kept the lone star tick population under control.

Tsao believes the lone star tick is now spreading more easily into Michigan as a result of warmer winters here. If the ticks become a larger population, even a cold winter may not kill all of them. Berrien County, one of the warmer spots in Michigan due to its southern extent and lake-effect warming in winter, is the county where Tsao has found the most lone star ticks.

Tsao calls this type of tick “more aggressive” than the black-legged and the dog ticks. She says the lone star tick will jump onto hosts, like us humans, rather than be passively transferred when a host brushes on vegetation. The ticks sense the carbon dioxide emitted from a human being or other host, and hop on.

While the lone star tick is not a transmitter of Lyme disease like other ticks, its bite can create another medical condition - a food allergy. If a person is bitten by a lone star tick, there is a chance that person could become allergic to red meat, and possibly milk from all mammals, including goat’s milk.

Dr. Michael Ledtke of Saginaw, a retired family practitioner and specialist in treating tick-born diseases, says he has treated thousands of patients for Lyme disease since 1986. In the past few years, he has had five patients who have developed a red meat allergy from lone star tick bites.

The allergy is called alpha-gal syndrome, he said. Alpha-gal is short for alpha-galactose, which is a sugar in the lone star tick. When the lone star tick bites a person, it can inject alpha-galactose into the person’s bloodstream. Ledtke says the human body would have no problem if the alpha-gal sugar was eaten or drank. However, when alpha-gal gets into the blood, it can cause the body to develop an allergic reaction.

This reaction typically comes three to six hours after the bitten person eats red meat, [according to a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine earlier this year.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMcps2017588) It included details of a Michigan man, 47, who developed a severe allergic reaction to meat. Ledtke says the typical reactions are diarrhea, bloating and headaches. While he hasn’t seen the most life-threatening allergic reaction - anaphylaxis - he says it would be possible.

There is a blood test that can detect antibodies to alpha-gal. Ledtke has had three patients test positive for the antibodies. One of Ledtke’s patients now lives in Kentucky, where the lone star tick is prevalent. She “picks ticks off herself everyday,” according to Ledtke. Like others, she can no longer eat red meat. This includes beef, buffalo, elk, venison, pork and goat - any meat from a mammal, he said. Tick-bitten people can also become allergic to the milk of any of these mammals.

Being bitten by a lone star tick does not guarantee a person will develop a meat allergy, Ledtke said. “There’s a lot we don’t know yet, but this is a well-established syndrome in the South.”

There are also treatments for this food allergy, he said. “As you treat the alpha-gal syndrome, the reactions to red meat get less.”

If you’re heading out into the woods, Ledtke advises people to stay in the center of trails. Wear long white socks over jeans. He says to cover all your skin. If you find a tick burrowed into your skin, take it off with tweezers right at the connection to the skin.
