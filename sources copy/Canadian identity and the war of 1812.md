Abstract
In 2012, the Harper government launched a national celebration of the bicentennial of
the War of 1812, even though few Canadians were aware of the anniversary or of the
war itself. While commemorating a largely unknown war might at first seem counter
intuitive, this article argues that the focus on the War of 1812 represented an oppor
tunity to engage in the construction of a different Canadian identity. In effect, the
narrative surrounding the War of 1812 celebrations permitted the Conservative gov
ernment to begin to establish a new "warrior identity" in contrast to the "peacekeeping
identity" that has been associated with liberal internationalism and the Liberal Party.
While liberal internationalism in both the study and practice of Canadian foreign policy
contributed to a national identity framed around shared internationalist values, the
narratives presented during the War of 1812 celebrations suggest an alternative under
standing of the "true" nature of Canadian identity.

among the ways Canadian taxpayer dollars were mobilized to support the cele  
bration of the anniversary.3 Heritage Minister James Moore defended the deci  
sion to spend millions of dollars by pointing to the growth in popular interest in  
the War of 1812 since the government had launched its commemoration plans.  
"Canadians are realizing that it is something that should be recognized across  
the country, not just in the regions where the battles took place," he said.  
Moore went on to argue that even if people wanted to debate the wisdom of  
the government's investment, "it's an essential role for government to remind  
Canadians what unites us."  
For Moore, the commemoration of the War of 1812 was an exercise conceived  
in part to remind Canadians of what and who they are as a people. The commem  
oration was justified, among other reasons, by the government's perception of  
a lack of emphasis placed on the teaching of Canadian history in high schools.  
As a result, argued Minister Moore, "it falls upon all of us who have a passionate  
belief in Canadian history, who have a deep feeling that we should be doing a better  
job of educating our kids, to take advantage of moments like this \[the bicentennial  
of the War of 1812\],"5 notwithstanding the fact that high school curricula are not  
under federal jurisdiction. Through the bicentennial celebrations, the Canadian  
government cast itself as history teacher, underlining the importance of "these  
historic moments" and of educating "our kids about the greatness that Canada

going forward."6 As if to confirm the necessity of this educative mission, a com  
prehensive survey conducted by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives Inc. for the  
Department of National Defence revealed that "few people who took part in the  
survey, and in related focus groups, were aware of the anniversary, and even fewer  
could identify the War of 1812 by name." The researchers went on to note that  
"typically, no more than one or two participants in each \[focus\] group were aware  
that this year is the bicentennial commemoration of the War of 1812, and these  
people tended to deduce this with simple arithmetic. From the year, 1812, they  
made the logical leap to the War of 1812. Most focus group participants had no  
prior awareness of this anniversary."  
This article begins to unpack the ways in which the commemoration of the  
War of 1812 represents an exercise in identity reconstruction. The efforts of the  
Conservative government to rescue the war from the obscurity of being a  
"mostly forgotten war, except by the handful of professional historians on

Canadian history took place decades before Canada became a sovereign state,
empowered with the right to make its own policies, including its own foreign
policy. As Jeffrey Simpson has noted, the celebration of Canada's military
prowess in this war ignores the fact that in 1812, "[t]here was no Canadian
army, although there were Canadian volunteers serving with the British, for the
Canadian colonies were governed by the British." Further, the argument that
"by frustrating the Americans, Canada was saved as a sovereign nation" belies
the fact that "there was no such thing as a sovereign Canadian nation at the
time of the war."10 Finding the roots of what unites Canadians from a time
when Canada did not exist as a sovereign state—much less a unified nation—
must be understood as a distinctly political strategy. If the Harper government
had wanted to celebrate an important event in Canadian history in the year
2012, for whatever reasons of national unity or harmony, it had other choices:

   awareness was not particularly high. As the report by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives revealed,  
   "even in areas where the war was fought—specifically Ontario's Niagara Region—awareness  
   remained foggy. In St Catharines, which is geographically close to where some significant  
   events of the War of 1812 took place, awareness of the 200th anniversary was higher, but still

choices to be medicare and the Charter."11 It had to be difficult to identify the  
War of 1812 as one of Canada's enduring symbols when the vast majority of  
Canadians were unaware of the war or why it might be important, both before  
and throughout the bicentennial celebrations.  
The choice of the War of 1812 as the historical milestone around which the

Harper government organized a series of events, activities, and testimonials, there  
fore, cannot be separated from its political agenda and its understanding of the  
world into which Canada's foreign policy is projected. Neither medicare (the result  
of Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF)/New Democratic Party (NDP)  
policies) nor the Charter (brought into being by the federal Liberal Party) would  
respond to the exigencies of Conservative Party politics. The advantage of the War  
of 1812 as part of a new national narrative was that not only would it allow the  
government to begin to recast the place of the war (and of war more generally) in  
Canadian popular history, it would do so in and against a particular context—that  
of Canadian internationalism—long identified with the Liberal Party of Canada.  
As Kim Richard Nossal has argued, the overarching foreign policy orientation of  
the Harper government has been the belief in a Manichaean view of world politics,  
wherein the international scene is dominated by "a struggle between good and  
bad," and in such a black and white world, "the real defining moments for the  
country and for the world are those big conflicts where everything's at stake and  
where you take a side and show you can contribute to the right side."12 In addition,  
however, as Nossal has detailed, for the Harper government, "the primary purpose  
of international policy is to advance a domestic partisan agenda."13 To state it  
more bluntly, foreign policy is also an instrument (among many others) that can be  
deployed to assure the destruction of the Liberal Party as the "natural governing  
party" of Canada, and its replacement in that role by the Conservative Party. The  
celebration of the War of 1812 is consistent with these objectives not only because it  
casts Canada as a country "born out of conflict"14 that chose to fight for the  
"right" side and the "right" cause, but also because it creates the space in which  
it becomes possible to respond to and begin to reframe the identity markers fur  
nished for decades by the internationalism of Louis St. Laurent, Lester B. Pearson,  
and the Liberal Party of Canada.  
If the framing of the War of 1812 was done in response to the tenets of liberal  
(and Liberal) internationalism, it is useful to return briefly to the meanings  
associated with it. While internationalism has been understood as a series of  
foreign policy practices (support for international institutions, multilateral pro  
cesses, and international law) giving middle power countries the potential to  
influence great powers within multilateral structures, internationalism has

##### also "promoted a sense of Canadian identity at the national and inter

```
national levels."15 In this sense, the study of Canadian foreign policy is not
only about the policy practices of the Canadian government; it also asks ques
tions about how these practices contribute to defining the nature of Canada. In
its promotion of Canadian identity, two elements of liberal internationalism
stand out as critical: first, internationalism implies a conviction about the
higher calling to which Canadians are held; its "purpose," in that sense, is to
provide a unifying common understanding of the virtues of Canada as an inter
national "brand" despite the complexities of Canadian diversity. As such, the
moral content of Canadian foreign policy (helpful fixer, good international citi
zen, peacekeeper, protector of the weak) is a powerful contributor to national
unity; if selflessness and altruism define who and what Canada is on the inter
national scene, they also affirm who and what Canadians are at home. Second,
and directly related to the first, the moral content of liberal internationalism
projects a Canadian identity distinct from that of its southern neighbour, defining
a set of ways for Canadians to assert (and to confirm) their distinctiveness from
the United States.
```

```
The War of 1812 as a new discursive frame
```

The celebration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812 reframes Canadian identity  
in ways different from the frame provided by liberal (and Liberal) internationalism.  
Despite its differences, however, the 1812 reframing of the "true" nature of  
Canadian identity continues to respond to the two imperatives of the internation  
alist discourse outlined above: the construction of a unifying pan-Canadian iden  
tity that also asserts Canada's distinctiveness from the United States.  
Liberal internationalism as a discursive project is intimately linked to Canada's  
role in the resolution of the Suez Crisis and the awarding of Lester B. Pearson's  
Nobel Peace Prize. The recasting of Canada from a peacekeeping nation to one  
"born out of conflict" is, in the Harper government's framing, also tied to one  
event: this time, the War of 1812. It is worthy of note that by articulating the War  
of 1812 as a national project before there was a nation, the Harper government is at  
least implicitly suggesting that a peace prize awarded in the 1950s constitutes an  
aberration in the definition of Canada's "authentic" national identity. It is not  
Nobel Peace Prizes that "define who we are as Canadians," but rather the "vet  
erans who defended our land and ultimately won the fight for Canada."16 In this,  
the government of Canada is (arguably more subtly) reflecting the views of one of  
the most ardent defenders of Canada's militaristic past, Jack Granatstein. In focus  
ing on the War of 1812, the Harper government is merely "highlighting something

everyone should know about anyway. There is a military past in Canada, and it  
should be noted—not... hidden behind soft 'pacifist' views that have been perpe  
tuated by popular social history of the last 40 years."17 From this perspective, the  
legacy of the Pearson Nobel Peace Prize is to be found in the soft pacifist views that  
deny Canada's true military identity—and the "truth" of that identity is enshrined  
in the date of its birth: 1812 rather than 1956.

#### 1812 as a unifying moment

The recasting of Canada as a military or warrior nation (rather than as a peace  
keeping one) does not merely rest on the ability of the government to reach further  
back into history than the peacekeeping narrative is able to go.18 Considerable

##### efforts are deployed to create a discourse that unifies rather than divides

Canadians. Of particular note, the representations of the War of 1812 emphasize  
the participation of Canada's First Nations, as well as of francophone Canadian  
soldiers, in the effort to vanquish the enemy. The war's commemorative symbols  
focus on this tripartite "Canadian" alliance. As an example, the special silver dollar  
coin produced by the Canadian Mint (selling for almost $60) depicts "a British  
sergeant, a Voltigeur Canadien and an Iroquois warrior wearing historically accur  
ate uniforms, approaching the invader with unity of purpose to defend the border  
and colonies they represent."19 The "major figures" deemed central to the war  
effort similarly highlight the contributions of Canadians of anglophone, franco  
phone, and First Nations backgrounds.20 As the Government of Canada's War of  
1812 website reminds us, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock, the "Hero of Upper  
Canada," was a member of the British Army. With the arrival of war in 1812,  
he initiated an aggressive campaign to protect Upper Canada, even though his  
superiors had advised him to remain on the defensive. Tecumseh, a Shawnee  
chief and leader of a large tribal confederacy that opposed American territorial  
expansion, joined Brock in the battle to capture Detroit on 16 August 1812. For his  
part, Charles de Salaberry served as an officer of the British Army in Lower  
Canada (now Quebec). As war loomed in the spring of 1812, he helped raise a  
unit of militia corps, known as the Canadian Voltigeurs, from among his primarily

The government of Canada is not content to reach back to 1812 to confirm Canada's militaristic
roots. Extensive celebrations are planned for 2017 in remembrance of the 1917 Battle of Vimy
Ridge and the sacrifice of thousands of Canadian soldiers. As a precursor to these celebrations, the
new polymer $20 bill features the Canadian National Vimy Memorial located in northern France,
rather than the artwork by First Nations artist Bill Reid, notably his sculptures Raven and the First
Men and Spirit of Haida Gwaii, as was the case with the "old" $20 bill.

Canadians in the prosecution of the war. For example, in a speech given in the
Quebec community of Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix in September 2012, Harper
emphasized the importance of the contributions of francophone Canadians to
the war effort: "One of those men was Lieutenant-Colonel De Salaberry. He bril
liantly led his troops, the Voltigeurs canadiens, at the Battle of Châteauguay. His
heroic victory made it possible to protect Montreal. His achievements made him
one of our most esteemed military leaders."22 In a ceremony held at Rideau Hall to
honour the contributions of Aboriginal peoples in the War of 1812, Harper con
tinued in this vein, this time highlighting the role of Canada's First Nations:
```

##### "During the War of 1812, First Nations and Métis warriors stood shoulder

```
to-shoulder with English and French-speaking militias and British military forces
to defend our country against American invaders... Without their courage and
honour, Canada would not have been able to successfully defend itself and we
would not have the peaceful and prosperous country our citizens enjoy today."
The true point of Harper's testimonials became clear later in his speech honouring
```

##### De Salaberry and providing retroactive theatre distinctions ("Defence of

```
Canada—1812 to 1815") to six Canadian regiments whose precursors participated
in the War of 1812:
```

```
The regiments honoured include of course the Royal 22e and the Voltigeurs de
Québec.
```

```
The 22e Régiment in particular is well known for its important role in both world wars
and more recently in Afghanistan.
```

```
But its origins date back in fact to the fight for Canada in 1812, in particular the
battles in the Châteauguay region under De Salaberry.
```

```
And the famous Citadelle of Québec was built in response to that war.

```
It is another example of the influence that the War of 1812 has had up to this very day
both on our history as a country and on our cultural heritage.
```

```
Friends, what makes this war so important is that French Canadians, English,
Aboriginal peoples and many others, like freed slaves, took up arms together to
achieve a common objective, to resist the American invasion.
```

```
And the ties our ancestors forged laid the foundations of a truly pan-Canadian iden
tity and made our Confederation possible, a country of great cultural diversity with
two national languages.
```

```
Let us always remember that this country, Canada, exists only because of diverse
peoples, English-speaking, French-speaking, Aboriginal, and others, who came
together in 1812 to resist the American invasion and to defend their unique identities
and our shared territory.
```

The War of 1812 assumes an almost mythical status in this retelling, for it becomes  
a moment in which a "true" Canadian national identity is forged. In contrast to  
Canadian internationalism, where a pan-Canadian identity is constructed through  
an attachment to specific political values (however exaggerated), this new Canadian  
identity is born of political necessity. Canada's identity stems from the commitment  
of its peoples—especially English, French, and First Nations—to defending  
Canada from American invasion. Canada, as the former minister of national  
defence Peter MacKay would have it, was thus "born out of conflict" rather  
than out of legislative gradualism. In this narrative, Canada was forged in the  
crucible of war, in which all of its founding peoples played a key role. Of course,  
these claims of collaboration between all of Canada's peoples gloss over how many  
residents of what would become Ontario would have been happier fighting for the  
Americans (and providing them aid and comfort when they could). Similarly, in the  
United States, there were clear divisions between Republicans and Federalists over  
the wisdom of the war. Historian Alan Taylor's much-respected 2010 book, The  
Civil War of 1812, suggests the extent to which representations of the war as a  
battle between two nations is overstated to the point of misrepresentation.  
More importantly, the 1812 portrait of a unified Canada is not developed  
around the values of peacekeeping or good international citizenship; it is not  
Canada—the honest broker. It is Canada the warrior nation, with all of its peoples  
participating in that warrior inclination. Individual differences between Canadians  
based on their language or ethnic group are largely irrelevant in this warrior nation.

24. Prime Minister Stephen Harper, "PM delivers remarks in Saint-Paul-de-1'île-aux-Noix, Quebec."  
    Of course, the defence of Canada theatre distinctions were being awarded for battles waged at a  
    time when Canada did not exist and therefore cannot be said to have been defended, at least not as  
    properly understood.

For Harper, this point is particularly clear, as he revealed in his Canada Day 2012  
speech:  
Almost exactly two centuries ago, an American invasion of Canada was launched.  
Our ancestors, English, French, Aboriginal, people of all backgrounds, joined in the  
fight for Canada.  
It was during the War of 1812—the battle for Canada—that the very foundations of  
this great country of ours were laid.  
A country born in French, a country proud of its cultural diversity, stability and  
prosperity, a country, Canada, that stands apart in North America.  
In fighting together, our ancestors in 1812 laid the basis for a common sense of  
Canadian nationality based on diversity.  
And they laid the basis for the vision of freedom, democracy and justice that is our  
inheritance, Canada, the best country in the world.  
The War of 1812 gives birth to a common sense of Canadian nationality based on  
diversity. Difference is not itself important, although what differences exist—within  
Canada and between Canada and the United States—were the results of the War of  
1812: "Without the War of 1812, the French fact in North America would not be  
protected here in Canada. Without the War of 1812, the Aboriginal fact would not  
be protected. Without the War of 1812, Canada would not have been established in  
1867."27 Canadian identity is thus entrenched (and defined) in a particular under  
standing of the source of the Canadian values that Harper outlines. His under  
standing of the source of these values is made clear in a speech given at the Chief of  
Defence Staff Change of Command ceremony on 29 October 2012. While one  
might expect that the speech would herald the many contributions of General  
Natynchzyk during his four years as chief of the defence staff, it in fact begins  
by painting a picture of Canada that finds its origins in the War of 1812. Speaking  
about the Canadian military as an institution, Harper points out that:  
Two hundred years ago this year, the first roots of this institution took hold when  
Canadians of diverse backgrounds risked, and in many cases, lost their lives in the war  
that firmly established our existence as a separate country.

```

```
And in every generation since the War of 1812, a special group of citizens, men and
women, have put on the uniform and put themselves in harm's way, so that their
fellow Canadians need not.
```

```
It is the institution of the military, the institution through which different
Canadians in all their diversity have participated, and the war waged by the mili
tary, which has constructed the nation. As the prime minister reminds us on the
1812 website, "[t]he War was instrumental in creating Canada's armed forces.
Many of our current reserve regiments in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada
trace their origins back to this time. It was the beginning of a long and proud
military history in Canada."29 We are not peacekeepers, we are warriors. This is
not the Canada of the Nobel Peace Prize, this is the Canada of bumper stickers
reading "War of 1812: Been There, Won That."
The unifying nature of this new narrative of Canadian identity is thus a function
of "everyone" having participated in the war. The loyalty to a coherent and unified
Canada despite our diversity stems from the loyalty owed to those who ostensibly
fought to protect it between 1812 and 1815. Just as the deaths of Canadian soldiers
in Afghanistan were often mobilized to legitimize Canada's continued participation
in the war (to withdraw would have betrayed their sacrifice), so too, the fact that
"Canada's diverse peoples" repulsed the American invasion, with many dying in
the effort, is more than enough to construct a unified Canada two hundred years
later. As Minister Moore has been fond of saying, it is "[t]hese heroic efforts" that
"tell the story of today's Canada."
```

```
1812 and the birth of a distinct Canada
```

If the War of 1812 constructs Canada as unified by the very fact of Canadian  
participation in the war, how does the 1812 narrative construct Canada as distinct,  
notably from the United States? At first, the answer seems self-evident. Canadians  
are not Americans because Canadians "won" the War of 1812. The war defined, in  
Stephen Harper's words, "what side of the border we live on, and which flag we  
salute." Canada stood up to the American invasion. As Minister Moore put it in  
June 2012, "As Canadians, we are used to thinking of our neighbours to the south  
as friends and allies. But, 200 years ago, American troops stormed our borders.

Thomas Jefferson said the American invasion would be 'a mere matter of  
marching'... The War of 1812 was the fight for Canada."32 The pride at having  
proven Jefferson wrong (and the pleasure of quoting his erroneous assessment  
some 200 years later) is evident. Whereas the narrative of internationalism con  
structed Canada's distinctiveness on the basis of its "middle power" values, the  
1812 narrative posits that Canada's distinctiveness rests on having defeated the  
United States in the "fight for Canada": "The War of 1812... defined our terri  
torial integrity, defined us differently from the United States and was instrumental  
in the creation of our country,"33 Moore explains. The 1812 narrative constructs a  
unified Canada because all of Canada's diverse people fought in the war, and a  
distinct Canada because "we won." The space for political discussion around  
values is limited, because the War of 1812 establishes the facts.  
The Harper government does not rest here in deploying the 1812 narrative. The  
war is also constructed as the catalyst for peace. In the words of the prime minister  
himself, "The signing of the Treaty of Ghent and other treaties that followed  
confirmed the border between Canada and the United States—now the world's  
longest, undefended border and an example of nations coexisting peacefully side by  
side with mutual respect and friendship."34 War is an instrument that brings sus  
tainable peace, and the implication is clear. Without the War of 1812, Canada's  
relations with the United States might well be fraught with tensions and challenges.  
The War of 1812 resolved all of that.

##### Finally, Canada is also distinct from the United States because Canada is

```
British. The Canada of today, born of the War of 1812, is "an independent and
free country in a constitutional monarchy with its own parliamentary system."35 The
attachment to the Crown, while subtle, marks the 1812 narrative and the symbols
supporting it. Graphical representations of the major figures of the war reproduce
their British military uniforms. The Union Jack is foregrounded, always flying
high. When Prime Minister Harper met with First Nations leaders at Rideau
Hall to thank them for their contributions to the War of 1812, the Crown was
omnipresent in his remarks:
```

```
All those years ago at the conclusion of the War of 1812, and in recognition of their
valour, Aboriginal communities were presented with military banners and King
George the Third medals. So it will be today.

The medal design has a likeness of Her Majesty The Queen on one side, and the image
from the commemorative banner on the reverse. Usage of the Queen's likeness and the
design of the medal itself were approved by Buckingham Palace. They are bestowed
today as symbols of an unbreakable bond forged in a common struggle.
```

There is an attachment to a notion of benevolent queen and country which tra  
verses Harper's 1812 speeches, nowhere more clearly than in his assertion that "the  
War helped establish our path toward becoming an independent and free country,  
united under the Crown with a respect for linguistic and ethnic diversity."37 The  
continued diversity of Canadians, made possible by the outcome of the War of  
1812, is a diversity that is articulated within a specific—British—context. If the  
narrative of internationalism—of a compassionate Canada engaged with the  
world—was mirrored domestically by the ethos of multiculturalism, the narrative  
of 1812 has no such pretenses. Multiculturalism is replaced by an explicit attach  
ment to the British Crown. Adding the prefix "Royal" to the Canadian Navy and  
Air Force, as Harper did in 2011, is only one manifestation of this narrative.38 The  
Canadian military, which forged the nation, is a Royal one.

Conclusion: The battle of the narratives

If the narrative of 1812 has tried to recast Canadian unity and distinctiveness along  
new lines, we must ask about the impacts of such a discursive manoeuvre.39 As I

to-the-victory-stephen-harper-honours-first-nations-contribution-to-war-of-1812/ (accessed 3
April 2013). Nowhere in his speech does Harper allude to the very complicated, and often con
frontational, relationship between First Nations peoples and the Crown. For First Nations peoples
throughout North America, the War of 1812 was far more a "desperate struggle for freedom and
independence" and a fight "to defend their homelands" than a question of choosing sides—and
certainly not of lining up with the British to defend Canada from American invasion. See "Four
Wars of 1812," Military History Research Centre, Canadian War Museum, http://

It is important to note that the campaign to celebrate the bicentennial of the War of 1812 was
almost certainly not successful in teaching Canadians about the war or its importance. As the
report by Phoenix Strategic Perspectives (cited at the outset of this article) discussed, even during
the height of the 1812 celebrations, "the relevance of commemorating the event seemed lost on
almost all" (Canadian Press, "Few Canadians aware"). Nonetheless, the extent to which
Canadians learned, or indeed, cared, about the War of 1812, despite the expenditures of millions
of dollars, is in some respect beside the point. The messages about Canada that the Harper gov
ernment associated with the celebration of the War of 1812—messages that appear in other cam
paigns in other contexts—transcend the specifics of this one effort at commemoration.

have argued elsewhere, understood as part of the process of constructing and  
reinforcing a specific Canadian identity, the use of the internationalist narrative  
has not been without its consequences.40 If Canada is unusually virtuous and moral  
on the world stage, this necessarily implies that others are not quite as virtuous or  
possessing of the same moral superiority. A claim of being a uniquely virtuous or  
moral nation both casts Canadian domestic politics as uniquely harmonious and  
egalitarian (for such a virtuous moral posture internationally surely must be the  
result of a uniquely moral society domestically) and projects an imperial project  
abroad: in constructing Canada as noble, virtuous, and laudable, foreign "others"  
are necessarily constructed as less noble and virtuous.  
The 1812 narrative also clearly seeks to project Canadian authority internation  
ally by casting Canada as a prudent but potentially belligerent country. As Harper  
has made clear, Canadian foreign policy would not reflect the "soft pacifist" views  
associated by Conservative supporters with Liberal internationalism. No longer  
would the purpose of Canada's foreign policy be "just to go along and get along  
with everyone else's agenda. It is no longer to please every dictator with a vote at  
the United Nations."41 Far from the helpful fixer posture associated with peace  
keeping, Canada would not seek to mediate a resolution to conflicts, but would  
rather choose sides wisely and be prepared to fight.  
The 1812 narrative also acts to cast Canada's domestic sphere in a more com  
bative light. The War of 1812 defines Canada in the context of a political project,  
but one that is exclusionary as much as it is inclusionary (both rhetorically and in  
practice)—for it is the project of Empire. While Harper's speeches remind us of the  
participation of the French and the First Nations in prosecuting the War of 1812,  
they are integrated as subjects of the Crown, rather than as actors in their own  
right, with their own claims against the Americans. While the rhetoric of inter  
nationalism conceals an imperialism which is outwardly directed (if Canadians are  
morally superior, that moral superiority is exercised with respect to someone), the  
new rhetoric of 1812 constructs an imperialism which is both powerfully internal  
(one nation under the British Crown) and external (Canadians are right to fight  
wars because Canada was "born out of conflict" and Canada's glory was and is  
proven through war).  
This new rhetoric is also powerfully gendered, because war—and certainly the  
War of 1812—is man's work. The willingness to fight, to prove oneself superior to  
the American invaders, the glory of the ultimate sacrifice—the ideal Canadian in  
the service of the nation—is constructed along a model of militarized masculinity.  
Women are nearly invisible in this new narrative, despite the efforts of the Harper  
government to appear inclusive. That effort is focused first on the figure of Laura  
Secord, who fulfils the role in the 1812 narrative of "standing in" for all women

and of allowing the Harper government to claim that the 1812 discourse is inclusive
of everyone. The "official" story of Laura Secord is worthy of a close look:
```

```
Laura Secord's adventures started when her husband, James Secord, a sergeant in the
1st Lincoln militia, was wounded early on in the War of 1812. She managed to rescue
him from the battlefield during the battle of Queenston Heights...
```

```
In June of 1813, Queenston was still occupied by American troops when James and
Laura Secord were forced to host some American officers in their home. That's when
she overheard the Americans plan to surprise the British outpost at Beaver Dams and
capture the officer in charge, Lieutenant James FitzGibbon. Her husband, given his
injuries, was unable to deliver this message to the British so she set out to do it herself.
The direct route to the outpost was 12 miles (about 20 kilometres), and Laura was
worried that she would encounter American guards on her way there. She decided it
would be better to travel through fields and forests; it wasn't easy and when she finally
arrived, she was exhausted.
```

```
After she crossed the Twelve Mile Creek on a fallen tree, Laura was surprised to come
upon a First Nations' encampment. Once her mission was explained, the chief took
her directly to FitzGibbon. Two days later, American troops were ambushed near
Beaver Dams by First Nations warriors. FitzGibbon then persuaded the much larger
American forces to surrender.
```

##### In this War of 1812 biography, Laura Secord is the perfect—and per

```
fectly—militarized wife. She is an admirable helpmate to her soldier husband,
arguably going beyond the call of duty in rescuing him from the battlefield. She
cares for him and tends to his injuries. Once she overhears the plans of the
American soldiers, she decides she must warn the British, but only because her
husband cannot do so as a result of his wounds. She is the Rosie the Riveter of the
War of 1812—assuming a temporary duty because her husband cannot. The hier
archy of love—for god, country, and home—is revealed, as she sets out on a dan
gerous mission because loyalty to the (British) state is a higher calling, more
important that her own safety or that of her wounded husband.
Laura Secord is one of only two women given preeminence in the 1812 narrative,
although the one woman deemed to be a major figure. The second woman featured
in the Harper government's recounting of the war is Mary Henry, and her role is
even more characteristic of the gendered hierarchies necessary to construct militar
ized masculinity. During a particularly fierce battle in May 1813, a large American
army made an amphibious assault on Niagara, landing not far from the lighthouse

where Henry's husband, a retired artillery gunner, was the keeper. Throughout the  
landing and the extremely heavy bombardment, casualties were numerous with half  
the British and Canadians killed or wounded. During this entire action, Mary  
Henry walked the battlefield, bringing coffee and food to the troops and tending  
to the wounded, as though "guarded by some unseen angel from the peril which  
menaced her every step."44 Mary Henry is the ultimate nurse, bringing food and  
comfort to the troops. Her role, while celebrated, is supportive—of the men in  
battle, and of the state which wages war. Neither Mary Henry nor Laura Secord  
raise questions about state policy nor do they advocate solutions other than war.  
The near invisibility of women, their silent support for a nation at war, their  
selfless support of the men (and the state) that prosecute the war—these gender  
roles are replicated in the controversy surrounding the unveiling of the design  
finalists for the War of 1812 memorial which will find pride of place as a permanent  
fixture on Parliament Hill. The terms of reference for the design of the memorial  
required that the proposals represent seven distinct groups: the British Army, the  
British Navy, the Provincial Marine, the English-speaking militia, the French  
speaking militia, First Nations, and Métis.45 Of the two shortlisted statues, only  
one displays a woman—caring for a wounded soldier in the background.46 If war  
confirms the glory of the nation, women are not central to that project. The nar  
rative of 1812 confirms that foreign policy is man's work.  
Whereas the rhetoric of internationalism depoliticizes Canada's wars (by con  
structing them as peacekeeping or the work of the good international citizen—and  
therefore always right), the rhetoric of 1812 gives pride of place to Canada's mili  
tary and a particular Manichaean understanding of world politics. This under
