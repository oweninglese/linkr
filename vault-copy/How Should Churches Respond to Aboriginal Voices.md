Seeking "Right Relations":
How Should Churches Respond to [[Aboriginal]] Voices?
Marilyn J. Legge

Abstract

What moral and spiritual resources do churches have to open space for
transforming and maldng new relations with and among [[Aboriginal]] communities?

What values best express justice and are cross-culturally appropriate? Who
decides on the terms and how? When are moral agency and responsibility aptly
configured within unevenly structured relations of power? With special attention
to the [[United]] Church of [[Canada]] and to voices of [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]]
women, I explore elements of an ethical framework in dialogue with the Royal
Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples. The Commission suggests three roles that
religious institutions can play: to [[foster]] awareness and understanding; to
participate in public discussion; and to advocate at the local level in situations of
conflict. On what grounds can each role be adequate in practice and what are
some ingredients for ethical guidelines? I suggest what moral agenda and basis
might confirm the claims of ecclesial potential.

Introduction: "The Moment in Our Ribcages"
Of all the non[[government]]al institutions in [[Canadian]] society,
religious institutions have perhaps the greatest potential to [[foster]]

awareness and understanding between [[Aboriginal]] and non

[[Aboriginal]] people. This potential exists even though the Christian
churches' historical role was often that of supporting the dominant

society and contributing to the marginalisation of [[Aboriginal]]
people.1

Both church and state officially urge non-[[Aboriginal]]s to seek right

relations with [[Aboriginal]] peoples.2 Yet dominant [[Canadian]] politics,
identities, and values are blind to the legacy of [[colonialism]] and imperialism

that makes the cultural—and hence ecclesial—body of [[Canada]] unwell.3
Although in post-Christendom [[Canada]], mainline chinches and ecumenical
bodies no longer dream of controlling society, some have refused to
withdraw from the political realm or have neglected their continuing sense of
responsibility in the public arena.41 engage this issue as a fourth generation
[[Canadian]] of [[Scottish]], [[Irish]], and English ancestry with an abiding concern for

women's diverse voices, moral agency, and analyses of justice-making, of
seeking "right relations."5

There is a developing perception in popular and scholarly imagination
that religious bodies have unique social locations, institutional resources,
cultural power and presence that can be put in service of a common good.
What are "distinctively religious contributions" to current struggles for right

relationship between [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] peoples? The
immediate and ongoing role of churches begins with hearing subjugated
voices of [[Aboriginal]] people's suffering, struggle, and hope.6 Connie Fife, a
[[Cree]] poet, issues a call to take seriously "the moment in our ribcages." She
writes:

These are dangerous times
to live without love

to exist without beauty in our eyes.

These are times of hard loving,
the calling forward of regard
untangling of uncertainty

the time of light, star people and beginnings,

the moment in our ribcages.7

Connie Fife helps us imagine the ribcages of a common body, full of
beauty and regard, light and star people. In this common body, the moral
vocation is to breathe new life into "real solidarity. .. where it becomes clear
that the whole body suffers together" and can be healed and transformed. In
facing the legacy of residential schools, the dominant churches are in the
process of exa[[mining]] their own positions in the mirror-image of [[Aboriginal]]
"others."8 There is still a long way to go to account for [[Aboriginal]] people's

suffering and loss of land at the hands of [[Europe]]an immigrants and the
churches' complicity in their domination and exclusion. But for some, the
"calling forward of regard" and an "untangling of uncertainty" has perhaps
begun.

Seeking "Right Relations" 29
The Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples suggests three roles that
religious institutions can play: to [[foster]] awareness and understanding; to
participate in public discussion; and to advocate at the local level in
situations of conflict.9 What unique institutional resources do churches have
to open space for reconciling/transforming relations? The purpose of this
paper is to explore the adequacy, practice and ethical guidelines of each role.
It will also suggest what moral basis might confirm the claim of ecclesial
potential.

Relationship Building: To Foster Awareness and Understanding
between [[Aboriginal]] and Non-[[Aboriginal]] Peoples
In this section I will sketch some of the historical context of the

relationship of First Nations to the rest of [[Canada]], in particular in terms of

the residential school system. Then I will turn to consider one ecclesial
response to this legacy, that of the [[United]] Church of [[Canada]]. From roughly
the turn of this century it was the policy of the [[government]] of [[Canada]] to

provide education to a portion of the [[Aboriginal]] peoples through "[[Indian]]
Residential Schools."10 The schools were part of the colonial will to
"civilise" [[aboriginal]] peoples, i.e., to create good citizens; to "inculcate a
moral sense;" to Christianize. The overall aim of missionary work coincided:
to enable [[Native]] peoples to assume "privileges and responsibilities of
Christian citizenship .. . carrying demands for conformity to the mores of
the majority."11 While the missionary movement assumed [[Aboriginal]]
peoples had a right to education and to hear the gospel, residential schools,
run by various church organizations under the auspices of the federal
[[government]],12 were broadly established in the mid-to-late nineteenth century

as part of a strategy to implement the federal [[government]] policy of
assimilating [[Indian]] peoples into wider society.13 The [[government]] aimed to

remove [[Aboriginal]] peoples as obstacles to the expansion of English
speaking society and to alleviate the resultant needs many [[Aboriginal]]
communities experienced. The coalescing of these two broad concerns

political and humanitarian—dovetailed with church missions; they bolstered
the belief that [[Western]] culture was the way of the future and that [[Aboriginal]]
peoples needed to become westernized to survive. For these ends, [[Aboriginal]]

[[child]]ren were removed from their parents and communities, placed in
schools at often long distances from their homes, and schooled in foreign

ways and language, often subjected to harsh discipline, inadequate food,

grueling manual labour, poor living conditions, and emotional and

sometimes sexual abuse.

Residential schools for [[Aboriginal]] [[child]]ren were mostly absent from
[[Canadian]] consciousness until the [[1990]]s when headline stories brought to
public awareness the abuse of [[child]]ren in the schools where [[Aboriginal]]
[[child]]ren were often subjected to physical, spiritual, emotional, and sexual

abuse. A regular response by mainstream [[Canadian]]s to these accounts, and
to the wider complex legacy of hint, disinheritance, and injustice, has been
denial or apathy, including about how churches were complicit in cultural

abuse or genocide particularly through the eradication of traditional
spirituality.

One key challenge to the potential roles of religious institutions and their

"unique contribution" is Christian complicity in cultural genocide of
[[Aboriginal]] peoples. For some, the contradictions "between the claims and
intentions that led Christians to become involved in residential schools and

the damage that resulted are so massive" that they have prompted "a
legitimation crisis" for Christian ethics.14 Several churches have issued
apologies to begin the long struggle to repair broken relations.
Christians and church institutions are discovering that this is not the result

of benign neglect; indeed, the creation of inferior "others" has been and
continues to be rooted in and made acceptable, even mandated, as "God's
will." Relations of domination and subordination of [[Aboriginal]] peoples
were built over time on the racist and economic premises of non-[[Aboriginal]]
[[Canadian]]s who assumed they knew what was best for [[Aboriginal]] peoples—
in collusion with the ruling desire for land and national development.15 The
residential schools' experience poignantly bears serious lessons for churches
and how they shape and practice religion today which include, as Terry
Anderson observes, "that our best efforts may contain destructive distortions,
or be harnessed for wrong ends."16 In the mounting evidence of the evil
perpetrated in the name of good, the churches have received a wake-up call
to assess their role, make amends, and leam to transform in radical ways.

I will now focus on the [[United]] Church of [[Canada]] as a case study of
[[foster]]ing awareness and understanding as one dimension of seeking right
relations between non-[[Aboriginal]] and [[Aboriginal]] peoples.17 In its brief to the

Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples, the [[United]] Church has

acknowledged that:

... the Residential Schools were premised on a racist
understanding of the superiority of [[Europe]]an civilization as it was

being transplanted in [[North]] [[America]], and the inferiority of
[[Aboriginal]] societies. This racist premise was reinforced by the
churches in their [[theology]] and their attitudes to [[Native]] spirituality.

Contact between these two ways of living in the world led to a
rapid and often bmtal disintegration of the [[Aboriginal]] way of life.

Combined with the relentless economic and social pressure of
expansionist [[Europe]]an society, the effects of the Residential
Schools dealt an almost fatal blow to [[Aboriginal]] societies.18

In [[1984]], Alberta Billy, a First Nations woman from Cape Mudge, [[British]]

Columbia, issued an historic call to the [[United]] Church General Council

Executive (its highest body of decision making): "It is time you apologized

to native peoples."19 On [[August]] 15, [[1986]], the Sudbury General Council
responded with an "Apology to [[Native]] Congregations" for having failed to
respect the depth and richness of [[Aboriginal]] spirituality and vision, and for
confusing the gospel of Jesus Christ with western institutions and cultures:
Long before my people journeyed to this land, your people were

here, and you received from your elders an understanding of
creation, and of the mystery that surrounds us all that was deep and

rich and to be treasured. We did not hear you when you shared
your vision. In our zeal to tell you of the good news of Jesus Christ

we were closed to the value of your spirituality. We confused
[[Western]] ways and culture with the depth and breadth and length
and height of the gospel of Christ. We imposed our civilization as
a condition of accepting the gospel. We tried to make you like us
and in so doing we helped to destroy the vision that made you what
you were. As a result, you, and we, are poorer, and the image of
the Creator in us is twisted, blurred and we are not what we are
meant by God to be. We ask you to forgive us and to walk together
with us in the spirit of Christ so that our peoples may be blessed
and God's creation healed.20
The elders' acknowledged but did not formally accept the apology-only an
apology that is lived out could be real. Such accountability is the enduring
horizon of seeking right relations.
This process of accountability holds the [[United]] Church responsible, as
Stan McKay the first [[Aboriginal]] moderator asserts, for a [[history]] "for which
it must repent."21 Reconciliation involves, therefore, not only listening to the
suffering caused but evidence that the suffering has been heard, the wrong
doing acknowledged, and steps of repentance and redress taken. If apathy
and denial are structured social sins, the [[1986]] apology marks a potential new

beginning or "new partnership with First Nations communities."22
[[Aboriginal]] peoples in [[Canada]] are in theological terms the sinned against.
The recent lawsuits filed by survivors of residential schools—the victims of
the best intentions—have sharpened the understanding of the [[history]] for
which the dominant churches must repent, that of [[white]] [[racism]] and cultural
genocide.23

The All [[Native]] Circle Conference, established in [[1988]], created some

symbolic space to tackle the redress of these wrongs within the church. It is a

non-geographic governing body of [[Native]] congregations and an in

community theological training unit for [[Native]] ministry that officially
supports self-determination of First Nations peoples within the [[United]]
Church's structures and ethos. The realities of ongoing marginalization are
far less heartening.

In the [[1990]]s the churches and wider [[Canadian]] society began to hear and
pay attention to the stories of former residential school students and their
families.24 In response, the [[1997]] Statement of Repentance re-committed the

[[United]] Church to living out the [[1986]] apology. It states particular actions
required to keep open space for restoring a shared and mutual relation: to

acknowledge the role of residential schools in the suffering of [[Native]]
peoples; to express deep regret and sorrow for injustices done and for the
role of the [[United]] Church in residential schools; to continue dialogue and
consultation with First Nations people in order to consider appropriate means
to express repentance, and to take further steps along the healing path and

towards reconciliation; to learn directly from [[Native]] persons about their
experiences in residential schools or to study resources such as those
provided by the Healing Fund or both (see below); to petition the
Government of [[Canada]] to accept its responsibility for the abuses of the
residential schools and to take meaningful steps immediately to redress those

abuses. These resolutions were aimed "to set a positive example that the
Government of [[Canada]] should be persuaded to follow."25
These ecclesial responses confirm the roles of [[foster]]ing awareness and

understanding, participating in public discussions, and advocacy. The
commitments also generate conflict and confrontation within religious
institutions as well as with the state. Such conflict should not be surprising
since religious ethics are enacted in concrete situations where evil is met, in

this case dealing with the legacy of the residential schools within the
political context of religious institutions, [[government]] relations, and the wider
society. In this case, the ongoing revelations of physical and sexual abuse of

[[child]]ren in residential schools have galvanized some [[Canadian]] church
awareness, participation and advocacy, particularly at national levels. Issues
of redress and reparation (providing compensation for wrongs done) are long
outstanding as churches struggle with the [[government]] over apportioning

responsibility as well as with competing ecclesial claims of risking new
relations or maintaining their institutions.26

The values and vision of religious institutions are often expressed in
practical efforts of education and pastoral action to address injustices done
and to mend relations, for example, in the [[United]] Church's Healing Fund

([[1994]]) and The Justice and Reconciliation project ([[2001]]). The Healing
Fund was first initiated in response to the request of First Nations people
asking the church to be part of a healing process. It frames the relationship
across cultures in theological terms of mutuality and is an ongoing project of

practical reconciliation in material and spiritual terms. It is designed to
support projects that help First Nations communities respond to some of the

painful dimensions of the residential school experience and for non
[[aboriginal]] Christians to become aware of the systemic problems at the heart
of this broken relationship.27

Seeking "RightRelations" 33
However, given the depth of [[white]] [[racism]] and colonization at work in
Christian religion, the moral vocation to promote healing and reconciliation

has floundered in response to the Healing Fund. The reaction to this
initiative across the [[United]] Church has been slow and disheartening, to the
point where it has totally withered in some areas. White congregations often
resist or reject the idea that healing and justice includes them too, or do not

feel morally obliged or otherwise moved to participate in seeking right
relations and a shared future. Sherene Razack analyzes this blindness as
"presumed innocence," a determined noninvolvement in social relations. In

this case, such denial is compounded because that noninvolvement is also
based on a repudiation of culpability.28
In recent ecclesial attempts to listen to [[Aboriginal]] peoples and to build

relationships across cultures and histories, the truth of domination and
exclusion by [[white]] churches of [[Aboriginal]] peoples is being unmasked. The
challenge for the dominant culture is to leam to understand how religion and

its symbols and practices are socially engaged and located, too. In an
attempt to [[foster]] awareness and understanding and to undertake healing and

advocacy, a second project has just been released in the [[United]] Church.
Justice and Reconciliation-. The Legacy of [[Indian]] Residential Schools and
the Journey Towards Reconciliation ([[2001]]) is an educational program for
non-[[Aboriginal]] congregations. As [[white]] liberal Protestantism struggles to
cope with its disestablishment and fragmented lives, the temptation is to seek
stability by either retreating to privileged circles where salvation is identified

as a purely spiritual experience unrelated to social context or by
(re)institutionalizing unjust relations by protecting churches from risking

changes required to seek reconciliation. The program reflects an ecclesial
struggle to offer a practical Christian political and social ethic, asking:

How are we to deal with this legacy as chinch and individuals?
Most of us were not personally involved in residential schools, yet
we are nonetheless linked to its painful legacy. We are part of a
church that participated in residential schools in the name of the

gospel. We are also part of a society that implemented and

benefited materially from the policies aimed at devaluing
[[Aboriginal]] cultures.29

This resource offers an overview of the [[history]] of assimilation and the
[[United]] Church's involvement in educating [[Aboriginal]] people against their
will. It then outlines a three-fold process for dealing with the problem of
denial, defensiveness, and paralysis displayed by non-[[Aboriginal]] Christians
if they hear of the terrible pain of the residential school legacy. In the hopes
of reconstructing and beginning new relationships, three normative elements
are meant to support and interact together:

1. Truth-telling — to hear the stories of [[Aboriginal]] peoples in
residential schools, to name [[racism]], to see the gospel-culture
connection, and to realize truth as plural;

2. Lamentation and repentance — to experience grief and pain,
recognize interconnectedness and solidarity, and move towards
authentic repentance and transformation;

3. Seeking the Spirit — only the Spirit of God can pull us away
from paralysis, and where, instead of acting, we need to wait on
God to learn to restore balance.30
Having reviewed and assessed examples in one denomination of attempts
to [[foster]] awareness and understanding, I move now to the second role of
religious institutions in seeking right relations.

Advocacy and Agency: Making Public Space for Discourses of
Marginalized Voices
The Royal Commission is concerned to end the marginalization of
[[Aboriginal]] Peoples; it also promotes the unique contribution of churches.
Advocacy for justice and love is birthed in struggle. Some non-[[Aboriginal]]
Christians are learning that to heed calls for justice and to respond to the
needs of others are expressed through conflicted relationships. Theological
ethicist, Gerard Fourez describes conflictual encounters with others as those
with potential to become epiphanies. In this meeting God is beyond and yet
in this heeding. When others confront and struggle with us, they force us to

give our unique response and to risk discovery of ourselves and our
humanity.31

Hence, a religious—as distinct from a political—dimension of advocacy
is nothing less than a standpoint of openness to "others." Religious concerns
for [[liberation]] and community, wholeness, and meaning in life can [[foster]]

relationships that challenge all to see the world from the standpoints of
others. An adequate advocacy stance is informed by keeping together more

specific accounts of the diversity of human life with a complex
understanding of the roots of suffering. Morally, the work of seeking right

relations is assessed by asking where are engagement and accountability
located? Whose concrete lives are represented? Connie Fife dedicates the
poem, "A Mother's Song," to Connie Jacobs and her son Ty from the Tsuu
T'in Reserve. Both were shot to [[death]] by police after Social Services tried to
apprehend her three [[child]]ren and she refused to relinquish custody of them

my son

i stopped the bullets
for as long as i could
until my heart was torn from my ribcage
and my shattered bone become flour on our kitchen floor
how i wept going down
down

to the moment when i could no longer withstand their bullets
your youth clearcutting a pathway
back into my arms when i held you up to the sun
singing praises for your birth

now i watch as righteous men
defend your murder
defend the onslaught of sliced corpuscle
and the tearing away of your muscle
and i sing
i sing your name into the mouth of every coming sunrise
and i will continue

until they know the significance of your birth
together with the act of stealing your life

and i will sing
and i will not stop32

In the inquiry that followed, the courts found that Constable Dave Voiler
had used excessive force. No charges were ever laid. Connie tried to shield

her son from the bullets that [[kill]]ed them both in the end. In terms of moral

agency, she risked all she had to fight for her [[child]]ren—her life.33 The
policeman's power, symbolic of the state and criminal justice system, was
untouched.

Fife's poetic narrative indicates that there are different risks for specific

people in refusing subjugation. The stories of the wide range of abuse of
[[child]]ren in residential schools, and the ongoing abuse of many [[Aboriginal]]
women and [[child]]ren especially in the [[Canadian]] justice system, are located in
racist and misogynist heritages of religious and social traditions.34 In many

women's experience as well as in the experiences of those who are
"othered," freedom to participate in the co-creation of shared meanings has

consistently been thwarted by social roles, values, and virtues that place
them within hierarchies of domination and exclusion. In a liberative [[theology]]
and ethics, the critical moral task is to uncover the massive social denial and

distrust of the moral agency of all those who inhabit "varied positions of
outsiderhood."35

Theologically, power is the capacity to act with God, to exercise one's
moral agency, always rooted in community, which Ruth Smith declares is
radical responsibility:

Agency involves responding to the needs, responsibilities, and
choices within the constraints of our experiences and situations.
Agency also involves the changing of historical conditions of our
particular nexus of relations and the critical self-consciousness and
activity through which we become aware of our relations and seek

to change them. ... To become a moral subject is itself a moral
task, if not the central moral task.36

If this be the case, listening to [[Aboriginal]] women's stories of victimization

and resistance, suffering, survival, and hope is necessary in the healing
journey; but simply validating that experience is not enough to refuse or
relinquish control and domination.
Janet Jakobsen names three levels of relationality necessary in the moral
labour of responsibility required for seeking right relations and the work of

advocacy: the interpersonal; subjective experiences linked with political
realities; and the funda[[mental]] relatedness of all things. This moral labor has

affinity with the teaching of various [[Aboriginal]] women's voices on then
needs for making right relations.

To move back and forth across different levels of relationships provides

various sites of critique necessary for critical awareness and responsible
agency. Moral agency, when placed in the diversity of relationships and the
creativity of justice-seeking, enables confrontation of domination as well as
maintenance of the type of critique justice is meant to ensure.37 For example,
Emma Laroque examines culturally appropriate models in alternative justice
work among [[Aboriginal]] peoples that will not disregard victims' interests,
particularly women's perspectives, in the name of 'restoring harmony' in
[[Native]] communities.38
When those in religious institutions hear stories of [[child]]hood deprivation

and abuse in residential schools perpetrated by policies of state and
complicity of churches, it becomes clear that many theologians and ethicists

have done so because they have overlooked the ways in which our overall
horizon of moral expectation is shaped by family patterns and the patterns of
our first communities of intimacy. The keen sense of reality that so deeply
affects moral development is the interpersonal, the so-called private sphere,

where gender and sexual patterns as basic social patterns are learned and
construed as given and "natural," rather than as culturally and socially

specific.39

A social ethic capable of addressing the legacy of residential schools with
its effects on generations who were not parented or cannot now parent well

because of the harm done has to connect the personal and political, the

private and public spheres. For religious institutions to realize their potential
of being agents of justice and reconciliation, they need to learn about ways
women are empowered to participate in shaping their own lives and their

communities and to advocate for their shaping of new relationships,
structures, and policies. For example, when theological ethics functions

publicly, women as specific others tend to fade away or become marginal
references. However, women have manifold experience of working to tell
the truth of their lives, to secure their own identities, to heal from trauma,
and to acknowledge a [[history]] of suffering and hurt—all crucial steps towards
reconciliation.

If religious institutions are to advocate for social, political, and economic
resolutions adequate to restore right relations with those most wounded and
burdened, they must leam to acknowledge that dominant theologies are not

only racist but also implicated in state, nation, gender, class, and sexual
systems. For example, understanding Christianity's deep [[misogyny]] and
consequent marginalization of women is also required to advocate for those
in the margins, particularly women. "Nothing can be said to be 'good news'
for women, including those who are victims [and survivors] of the racist and

classist dynamics of oppression, if a vicious Christian complicity in the
historical oppression of women is muted or denied."40 Therefore, women's
struggles to claim and sustain life need to be heard and brought into public
discourse as keen resources for resolving conflicts and finding new ways to
relate as persons and peoples.
Advocacy, as one strategy for seeking justice and reconciliation, requires
the creation of new relational spaces and a continual checking of strategies

and assessment of the consequences of action with those who bear the
burden, bell hooks insists that instead of meeting the "other" in the centre,
as colonizer, those in the mainstream are called to meet the "other" in the
margins:

This is an intervention. A message from that space in the margin
that is a site of creativity and power, that inclusive power, that

inclusive space where we recover ourselves, where we move in
solidarity to erase the category of colonized/colonizer. Marginality
as site of resistance. Enter that space. Let us meet there. Enter that
space. We greet you as liberators.41

Here the colonizers are not only implicated in but are dependent upon the
margins where voices of others, including ancestors and survivors, can jolt

us into an awareness of what is really going on in the current political
economic context and help us critically to locate ourselves in a world where
many are being forced to relinquish valued ways of life.
In responding to this challenge, some links are being made at the margins

with [[Aboriginal]] communities, both within churches, between [[Aboriginal]]

groups, and beyond in wider networks. Morally the claim of the other is
rendered possible in being at the margins and making space for silenced and
oppositional discourses in public. It is hoped that in this back-and- forthness,
moral vision is enlarged and sustained.
For example, some [[Aboriginal]] women ask about "justice for whom?" For
Patricia Monture-Angus, justice—as distinct from the machinations of [[white]]

criminal law—must be seen to be a process where harmony and right
relations are the ideal. She explains that:

[[Aboriginal]] women have survived oppression, colonization and
abuse. Now we seek recovery. Recovery and healing will only
come when we leant to walk in balance again, with the men, with
the leaders, with the [[child]]ren, with the Elders, and with the many
nations that have come to this land. For me, seeking harmony is
striving to reach a higher standard than mere justice.42

The ethical task of "walking in balance" relates to healing power, to
promoting [[health]], interdependency, and community; it refers to the balance
and harmony attained as a way of life as a path to wholeness which goes far
beyond the "mere justice" of the legal apparatus.
What ethical implications for advocacy does "walking in balance" hold?
Balance has to do with power and harmony, with respectful regard, with
including [[child]]ren and elders, women and men, honouring many nations, and

learning coexistence and cooperation. To live these values and vision
requires naming all that harms relations, learning how to live with ambiguity

as well as with some dignity and grace, and transforming structures of
oppression and privilege into those of freedom and fulfillment.43 The aim of
justice, therefore, is not to seek an ideal state of distribution but to assess
how the damage is done and to provide new beginnings for learning to walk
in balance.

Linda Tuhiwai Smith, an [[Aboriginal]] women from Aotearoa/[[New]]
[[Zealand]], names criteria for participating in public discourse and working
together as [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] peoples. These include: to revise
[[history]]; to acknowledge those still being colonized and searching for justice;
to ac[[company]] priorities announced by [[Aboriginal]] women and men; to heal;
and to support land claims struggles as a way of shaping the future.44 Elly
Haney also clarifies a critical and constructive view of justice as the moral
and spiritual basis for action. In this ethical framework, justice is both
[[liberation]] from oppression and [[violence]], and transformation of structures and

relationship toward more respectful, nurturing and creative patterns of
behaviour.45 Relationality, walking in balance, interdependency, dignity, and
moral agency are key moral norms in this work of restoring right relations
among [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] people.

Seeking "RightRelations" 39
In short, advocacy is rooted in a critical epistemology where all moral
thinking is considered partial and formed in specific social contexts. The
work of advocacy places theological and other cultural traditions under
scrutiny to reduce the temptation to make one's own context absolute and to

relate across differences towards understanding roots of suffering and
sources of hope. To work in solidarity requires development of alternative
practices, narratives, theologies, and communities. Take for example, [[white]]

Christian feminists, who, when invited, will enter into [[alliance]]s with

[[Aboriginal]] women who may not perceive gender as their primary concern;
they will also be mindful of appropriating another's traditions and in the

process of [[alliance]]-building challenge assigned categories and power
relations. Or note how the glossary of terms in Justice and Reconciliation
defines "cultural loss" but not cultural genocide. Why this omission? Whose
voice has been silenced? Whose tradition is being protected?
If ethics is to be about more than refusing to be dominated, it is also then
about refusing to dominate and working across differences. Some will have
to deliver themselves from doing for others in altruistic fashion and answer

Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz's call to recognise "common responsibilities and
interests which necessarily arouse shared feelings and lead to joint action."46
Seeking right relationship is about making moral claims through a process of
asking and responding, of being answerable to those who are unjustly treated

and being willing to listen, to be transformed, and to act for change. It
involves "untangling" those threads of relation which literally cut off
breathing and voice, in households, political economic decisions, and
spiritual beliefs and practices.

Healing Communities of Reflective Solidarity
To make space for marginalised voices simultaneously means building
inclusive communities. The challenge of seeking right relations, given a
[[history]] of imposed suffering, stolen land, broken trust, hearts, and bodies,
includes many ethical issues: to whose stories of injustice and from which
perspective to listen, of how to discern together the meaning of justice and
right relations, of means for atonement, reconciliation, and forgiveness. This
community-building requires self-critical awareness and the permanent risks

of recognizing particularity and connection, of cooperation and sharing
power, of conflict and ambiguous outcomes, all the while respectfully
sharing sources of hope.
A particular challenge for restoring relations that heal and nurture life,
justice and peace is the sharing and reception of spiritual gifts.47 As Achiel

Peelman insists, while interreligious dialogue has become an important
factor in the healing of [[Aboriginal]] peoples, it may also help the larger
[[Canadian]] society deal more effectively with the brokenness of its non
[[Aboriginal]] communities.48 Nonetheless, given the racist and patriarchal

colonizing of [[Aboriginal]] peoples by church and state, as well as how these
legacies live on in mainstream religions, there is hope in learning how to
welcome spiritual resources that encourage justice, reconciliation, and peace
and that respect different histories, structures, and identities, and spiritual
gifts. What gifts are being offered by [[Aboriginal]] peoples for edification of

the whole body, to learn "to walk in balance?" How can they be well

received and honoured?

The ongoing effort among First Nations to renew [[Native]] spirituality is
evident as they aim to harness their resources and develop their capacities
and communities. The traditional prayer in many [[Aboriginal]] cultures that
summarizes human connection to all life is the phrase "All my relations."49

This is at once spiritual and practical. It is a call to live with respect in
creation in the circle of life, to attend to human needs for dignity, food,
shelter, [[health]], community, bodily integrity, nonalienating labor, and cultural
and spiritual creativity. There is also responsibility in receiving [[Aboriginal]]

teachings of the circle of life (a place where everyone is welcome and
everyone is necessary to complete the circle as the basis of creation) to
reshape all concepts and practices, theological and political, that exclude and
marginalize some and harm the earth.

Christian churches are realizing that solidarity with First Nations'
struggles for land claims and self-[[government]] involves respect for traditional
spiritualities. It also includes support for those [[Aboriginal]] Christians who

wrestle with how to be both Christian and [[Native]]. For example, Nanette
McKay names four gifts [[Aboriginal]] peoples learn and practice within the

circle of life: generosity, patience, transformability, and consensus.
Generosity is the secret of giving everything away and becoming more;
patience, not acquiescence but practice of quietness, is the recognition that
balance, not force, propels transformation, and theologically patience is a
trust that our own createdness is beloved; transformability is awareness of
the [[flu]]idity of the whole universe which eliminates the need for artificial
boundaries and structures to trust that we were created [[flu]]id and dynamic;
and consensus is the traditional basis for [[Aboriginal]] community, what the
Anishnawbe describe as Pimadaziwin, the Good Life.
"The Good Life," she writes, "is a constellation of values which honours
the fullness of life for the whole community." In Christian terms, the good
life is understood through Jesus Christ who came that all might have life and

have it abundantly (John 10:10).5° This contemporary [[Aboriginal]] [[theology]]
reffames ethical virtues and norms for practicing religious life that in the
Spirit of Jesus welcome all those in need of healing, justice, and love. It also
exposes the ongoing need for an ecclesial presence that counteracts virulent
forms of exclusive funda[[mental]]ist Christianity that function as new forms of
colonization of [[Aboriginal]] peoples.51
The ecclesial work depicted here shares an assumption that spiritual life
and the wider public sphere are genuinely connected. That is, for religious

persons and institutions, like political persons and institutions,
transformation comes through a genuine moral resistance to oppression and
not through consensus on ideal principles for reconciliation.52 Obligations of
engagement and advocacy for restoring relations are especially underscored
in coalitional movements such as the [[Canadian]] Ecumenical Jubilee Initiative

and its focus on Sacred Land, Sacred Earth.53 The [[Ottawa]]-based [[Aboriginal]]

Rights Coalition works in partnership with [[Aboriginal]] peoples and
community organization.54 [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] spiritual leaders

are present to deepen reflection on [[Aboriginal]] justice concerns.55 These
radical ecclesially-sponsored, broad-based movements have provided other
forums for public discourse of justice and reconciliation and in[[flu]]ence the
agendas of mainstream chinches.
Conclusion

The key contribution for churches in keeping with the hopes of the Royal

Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples is this: to attend to justice and
reconciliation in ways that embrace political economy (land claims,
resources, and social infrastructure) as well as spirituality and culture in a
reflective and compassionate solidarity. The struggle to understand and seek

right relations between [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] peoples is also
necessary to renew religious commitment to a public ecclesial role of raising

moral concerns about injustice and the common good; it has potential to
open spaces for more supple, hospitable, and pluralist forms of ecclesial and
common life.

If religious institutions are not going to betray their stated allegiances to
the neighbour who stands as mutually in need, they will encourage a moral
horizon of inclusive and healing communities in service of a new commons
of civil society. Facing public moral deficits, renewed moral communities
would themselves need to be created along lines that account for the deep

and connected critique of patriarchy, of [[white]] supremacy, of cultural
imperialism, and of the capacity of globalized economic power to re
colonize nature, land and peoples. Elizabeth Bounds depicts this vision as "a
heterogeneous public where different groups with different life experiences
can participate in the policies affecting their lives."56As George Erasmus co

chair of the Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples recently asserted,
what is needed is a completely new relationship of [[Aboriginal]] peoples with
the rest of [[Canada]] that builds up peoples, their capacities, and a shared future
among peoples of many nations within a nation.57

To build this participatory capacity for right relations, [[alliance]]s are
crucial:

Alliances have special characteristics: [first] they demand
commitment; [second] they begin to break down dividing walls of

hostility by forcing participants to address inequalities of power
and unearned social advantages and to work through stereotyping

and suspicion toward honesty and trust; [third] they create a
broader and more coherent challenge to oppression and [[violence]];

and [fourth] they set the context and condition for faithful

theological and ethical reflection.58

In religious terms, the process of seeking right relations—or moving
towards new relationship—is conversion to the "Other." This other is not an
object of charity or a salve for guilt but a means of grace where the divine is

encountered in relationships of mutual healing and [[liberation]]. The

theological basis, for instance, of the Healing Fund appeals to mutual
solidarity. Simultaneously, as cumbersome legal matters proceed, it calls
upon the wider body to maintain connection with [[Aboriginal]] peoples who
are subjugated and seeking healing both inside and outside the churches. The
difficulty of engaging non-[[Aboriginal]] members of religious institutions and

their congregations in social movements remains huge. Face-to-face
relations are key nonetheless, especially because religious interaction is

meaningful precisely when it draws upon our capacity to engage

communicatively with another. Openness to going beyond alienated

otherness and to taking risks of vulnerability towards relational empathy, is
empowered and sustained in relations of compassionate diversity and with

all living things.59 Stan McKay announces this prophetic task: "The real
challenge is to take that reconciliation [experienced in the circle of healing]

out into the world when the world doesn't want to have any part of the

process.

NOTES

1 The Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples, vol. 5 ([[Ottawa]]: [[1996]]), 97. Roy

Commissions in [[Canada]] are a mechanism of liberal democracy whereby the state inqui
officially into a matter of public concern, for example, the Status of Women, [[1968]]-[[1970]]
[[Aboriginal]] Peoples, [[1991]]-6. They solicit a broad range of input and make a report w

recommendations to aid the generation of more effective public policies and practices. A Roya
Commission has wide-ranging scope, from ordering new [[research]] and studies to holding publi
hearings across the country for citizens and non-[[government]]al organizations to participate. T

Royal Commission on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples was created in the aftermath of the [[August]] 199

violent conflict at Kanehsatake (Oka) over a golf course expansion into land claimed

[[Aboriginal]]. A police officer was [[kill]]ed and armed [[Mohawk]] [[warrior]]s stayed behind barrica

for over 100 days. The [[United]] Church, which has [[Aboriginal]] and non-[[Aboriginal]] congregation
there, reiterated its stand in favor of self-determination and of the urgent need to find just a
non-violent resolutions. For highlights of the Report of the Royal Commission on Aborigi
Peoples, see http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/rpt/index_e.html.

First Nations, [[Native]] [[Canadian]], and [[Indigenous]], often interchangeably.

interests. At the same time, for instance in relation to [[Aboriginal]] peoples and Latin [[America]], the
[[Canadian]] state is imperialist, attempting to create false unity among classes and cultures at the
expense of different and diverse cultures, all in the name of increased security and wealth. See,

for example, Judith Emberley, Thresholds of Difference: Feminist Critique, [[Native]] Women's

Writings, and Postcolonial Critique ([[Toronto]]: University of [[Toronto]] Press, [[1993]]); and M.
Nourbese Philip, Frontiers: Essays and Writing on [[Racism]] and Culture (Stratford, [[Ontario]]: The

4 See Roger Hutchinson, Prophets, Pastors, and Public Choices: [[Canadian]] Churches and
the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Debate (Waterloo, ON: Wilfred Laurier University Press for
[[Canadian]] Corporation for Studies in Religion, Comparative Ethics Series Volume 3, [[1992]]), 92.
For example, in the highly charged political debate over the Mackenzie Valley Pipeline, Roger
Hutchinson proposes a dialogical ethical method and assesses the churches' contributions in
developing public awareness, advocacy of native people's position, and pressing ethical and
religious questions throughout that case.
5 Following a feminist [[liberation]]ist approach to [[theology]] and ethics, I frame my [[treatment]]
of seeking right relations, church, public, and community with specific interests: Where is

engagement and accountability located? Whose concrete lives are represented? Is there a
kaleidoscopic analysis of the causes of suffering and sources of hope? Are critical perspectives
being developed? Do moral norms include relationality and interdependence, dignity and moral
agency? Are private and public spheres connected? Does attention to justice embrace political

economy as well as culture in a reflective and compassionate solidarity? See Elizabeth M.
Bounds, Pamela K. Brubaker, and Mary E. Hobgood, "Welfare Reform: A [[War]] against the
Poor," in Welfare Policy, [feminist critiques], ed. Elizabeth M. Bounds, Pamela K. Brubaker,

12 Most of the schools were managed for the [[government]] on contract by four churches: the
[[Roma]]n Catholic church through some of its orders, Anglicans, Presbyterian, and [[United]]. It is
estimated that 100,000 [[child]]ren attended the schools, about twenty percent of all status [[Indian]]
students. For example, the [[United]] Church of [[Canada]] participated in the operation of a maximum
of 13 residential schools from the [[1920]]s until the last school closed in [[1969]].

assimilation, see for example, "People to People, Nation to Nation," in The Royal Commission

on [[Aboriginal]] Peoples ([[Ottawa]]: Minister of Supply and Services, [[1996]]). Laws buttressing

assimilation were codified in the [[Indian]] Acts of [[1876]], [[1880]], and [[1884]] and continued into the
twentieth century.

25 The 1[[998]] Moderator's Letter of Apology from Bill Phipps to former students of [[United]]
Church [[Indian]] Residential schools, and to their families and communities, reflects the growing
awareness of the evil perpetrated over time as well as the commitment of the church to hear and

help carry the burdens, whatever the cost. This most recent apology moves the manner of
repentance from a general to a more face-to-face and tangible connection. For example, ways to
assure survivors that their abuse was not their fault and that they have been deeply wronged are
being explored as part of a healing process.
26 The struggle over responsibility is currently ruled at 70% the [[government]] of [[Canada]] and

30% the [[United]] Church. Are the plaintiffs any further ahead given this ruling? David

peoples based on spiritual relationships to the universe, to the landscape and to stones, rocks,
insects and other things, seen and unseen, have been difficult arguments for [[Western]] systems of
knowledge to deal with or accept. These arguments give a partial indication of the different
world views and alternative ways of coming to know, and of being, which still endure within the

[[indigenous]] world. Concepts of spirituality that Christianity attempted to destroy, then to
appropriate, and then to claim, are critical sites of resistance for [[indigenous]] peoples. The values,
attitudes, concepts and language embedded in beliefs about spirituality represent, in many cases,
the clearest contrast and mark of difference between [[indigenous]] peoples and "the West" and
which "the West" has not yet been able to decipher, understand or control . . . yet." In Tuhiwai

Seeking "Right Relations " 47

53 Sacred Earth, Sacred Community: Jubilee, Ecology and [[Aboriginal]] Peoples ([[Toronto]]:
CEJI, [[2000]]) is the third volume of theological work by the [[Canadian]] Ecumenical Jubilee
Initiative which as of [[July]] 1, [[2001]] is part of Kairos. See www.kairoscanada.org.

54 The [[Aboriginal]] Rights Coalition stands in the radical faith-and-justice tradition of
[[Canadian]] ecumenism and the advocacy and educational mandate of its predecessor Project
[[North]] ([[1975]]). It was conceived as a three-way partnership consisting of 12 participating
churches and religious bodies, [[Aboriginal]] political organizations, and regional groups
throughout the country. It works on public education and action programmes designed to
support [[Aboriginal]] peoples, especially to recognize rights of [[Aboriginal]] peoples to land, [[treaties]]
and self-determination; to enhance the economic and political bases of [[Aboriginal]] nations; to

oppose the erosion of social rights, such as adequate housing, education, [[health]] care, and
appropriate legal systems; and to seek and clarify the moral and spiritual basis for action
towards [[Aboriginal]] and social justice in [[Canada]]. See www.home.istar.ca/~arc.
