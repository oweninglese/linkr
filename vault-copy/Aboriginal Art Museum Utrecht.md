Note: We recently spent a few weeks in [[Europe]] and finally had the chance to 
visit the [[Aboriginal]] Art Museum Utrecht. What follows is a preview of a piece 
that I wrote for publication elsewhere, so it’s a little more general in nature 
than things I’ve posted here in the past, but I wanted to share our impressions 
of this fabulous museum and the generosity with which we were welcomed by the 
staff. 
 
On a day that threatened (and finally delivered) rain, we rode the tram up to 
[[Amsterdam]] Centraal to catch the train 40 mms southeast to the medieval and 
modern city of Utrecht. A university town of about 300,000 inhabitants, the site
of the signing of the [[Treaty]] of Utrecht that ended the [[War]]s of [[Spanish]] 
Succession 401 years ago, Utrecht is in some ways a smaller, quieter version of 
[[Amsterdam]]. Laced with canals, full of centuries-old buildings that sport upscale
boutiques and excellent, tiny restaurants, it’s a charming city, once you get 
your bearings. The train station seemed larger than [[Amsterdam]]’s and it disgorged
into a leviathan of a shopping mall. Our destination was little more than ten 
minutes walk away, but we wandered, not quite lost, for nearly an hour before 
arriving there.
 
We were on our way to visit the [[Aboriginal]] Art Museum Utrecht[3] (AAMU), the 
only museum in [[Europe]] dedicated entirely to the contemporary art of the 
[[Indigenous]] people of [[Australia]]. Over the last 40+ years, a transformation of 
traditional iconography and artistic practice from impermanent, ceremonial 
creations into durable expression in acrylic painting, sculpture, photography, 
and even a new form of traditional use of earth pigments on the flattened bark 
of eucalyptus trees has blossomed into what the late critic Robert Hughes 
described as “the last great art movement of the twentieth century.” An 
expression of the [[Indigenous]] people’s enduring connection to the land they 
belong to, contemporary [[Aboriginal]] art is most often recognized in a format in 
which thousands of colorful tiny dots create seemingly abstract patterns of 
startling geometric design and intensity. Starting in [[1988]], the bicentennial 
year of [[Australia]]n settlement by the [[British]], and accelerating through the [[2001]] 
Sydney Olympics, [[Australia]] has adopted (and co-opted) this art form as a badge 
of national identity. Sadly, [[Australia]]’s long [[history]] of mis[[treatment]] of its 
tiny percentage of [[Aboriginal]] people (roughly 2% of the population of 23 
million) has not been materially altered by their recognition of this unique and
vibrant aesthetic culture.
 
[image 2: aamu-interior (link #5)][4]That culture has inspired international 
partisans, and there are numerous large and important collections of [[Aboriginal]] 
art worldwide, including several in the Netherlands. Some of these have found a 
permanent or long-term, loan-based home at the AAMU, which lies in the city 
center on the picturesque Oudegracht. We had met the Museum’s curator Georges 
Petitjean at the [[2006]] opening of the Musée du quay Branly[6] in Paris, where a 
significant public art commission incorporates the work of eight prominent 
[[Aboriginal]] artists in the architectural design of its administrative and 
curatorial headquarters building. We have been eager to visit Utrecht and the 
AAMU ever since, and we were not disappointed when we finally arrived there.
 
Georges and Director Mike Anderson were our hosts for the day and they gave us a
comprehensive tour of the museum. The major exhibition of the moment, Country to
Coast, focuses on art from the Kimberley region in [[Australia]]’s vast and sparsely
populated northwest [[corn]]er. It is an area where [[mining]] dominates, whence iron 
ore and uranium feeds the wealth of the nation via exports to Asia. And apart 
from the tiny concentrated settlements that serve the [[mining]] industry, it is 
largely populated by [[Aboriginal]] people, who in their turn primarily use ocher 
pigments extracted from the earth to create their depictions of ancestral 
creation myths and continuing contemporary connections to the land.

Is is an art as diverse as the country from which it springs. Paddy Bedford and 
[[Queen]]ie MacKenzie are among its most famous practitioners, with major canvases 
by the late Bedford often selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars in the 
secondary auction market. Camel [[Cree]]k, from [[2005]], is typical of the master’s 
late period, in which features of the landscape—hills, desert tracks, waterholes
that provide sustenance in the often forbidding environment—are represented with
extraordinary delicacy and nuance.
 
Lily Karedada uses the same ocher-based paints to recreate the figures of 
Wandjinas that have adorned the walls of caves and rock shelters for thousands 
of years. These spirit beings are associated with the coming of rain—again 
marking the importance of water—and the rock art depictions of them are 
regularly refreshed by new applications of color in their caves, as well as 
being reproduced and re-interpreted on bark supports for sale in the 
contemporary art market.

Away on the [[Pacific]] coast of [[Australia]], in the tiny mission town of Bidyadanga, 
a talented and self-assured young man named Daniel Walbidi decided, ten years 
ago when he was barely out of his teens, to encourage the elders in his 
community to take up acrylic paints to preserve a cultural connection that was 
on the point of vanishing forever. The Yulparija people originated in the inland
deserts of the Kimberley. But late in the twentieth century a combination of 
drought and the draining off of underground reservoirs of fresh water by the 
[[mining]] industry’s insatiable thirst forced them to abandon their homeland for a 
long trek to a more sustainable coastal home. Under Daniel’s precocious 
leadership they began to paint the stories of their desert homeland, but with a 
palette inspired by the vivid blues and greens of their new oceanside settlement
beside the traditional reds and oranges of the desert.
 
After touring the exhibition with us, Georges and Mike led us back out into the 
misty streets of Utrecht in search of lunch and further conversations about the 
collecting and exhibition programs of the AAMU. In addition to showcasing the 
tradition-based arts of [[Aboriginal]] [[Australia]], the AAMU does excellent work in 
demonstrating the breadth of this art form and its connections to contemporary 
artistic practice, taking the discussion out of the realm of ethnographic 
curiosity into the arena of installation art, video, and photography. A year 
ago, BOMB! [11]celebrated the 400th anniversary of the Peace of Utrecht with a 
large, multimedia installation of work created in concert by [[Aboriginal]] artist 
Adam Hill (aka Blak Douglas) and Adam Geczy, a Sydney artist who has lived and 
worked extensively in [[Europe]]. This coming fall, a new exhibition called BLAK: 
forced into images will focus on representations of [[Indigenous]] [[Australia]]n 
identity through the mediums of video and photography.
 
After lunch, we returned to view the installation of works from the museum’s 
permanent collection , which showcased the variety of styles, media, and content
that characterizes current practice. And then we were taken down into the 
subterranean vaults of the museum for a quick look at the innovative ways 
Petitjean and Alexander have transformed the potentially humid canal-side 
environment of an old [[Dutch]] building into a [[climate]]-controlled storage facility 
where the bulk of the collection can be safely housed.

We ended our visit, as one does, inspecting the museum shop. We somehow managed 
to resist the temptation to take a bit of [[Australia]] and Utrecht back home with 
us. Like any good museum shop, AAMU’s is crowded with plenty of good books that 
help to interpret the collections. But unlike many, it is also well stocked with
the art itself. Although modestly priced for the most part, the canvases and 
paintings on bark, along with fiber art and prints, were truly museum quality 
pieces themselves that would not have looked out of place on the walls of the 
gallery instead of the walls of the shop. We said our goodbyes with regret, and 
headed off under Georges’ direction through the narrow, winding streets of the 
city to regain the train station and settle in for the 45-minute ride back to 
[[Amsterdam]]. Along the way we enjoyed watching the deep green fields of the [[Dutch]] 
countryside slide past us, spotting the occasional windmill in the distance and 
following the progress of barges along the canals. But our minds’ eyes were full
of images of [[Australia]] that the visit had captured for us. Our short trip had 
taken us four centuries away from the Golden Age of [[Dutch]] painting that we’d 
been enjoying in [[Amsterdam]], and thousands of miles from the lowlands of Holland 
to the worn hills of a continent half a world away. It’s a journey I suggest you
take if you’re ever in the neighborhood.
