## Abstract

**Background.** The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity of [[COVID]]-19 vaccination in persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. **Methods.** Employees of the Cleveland Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, [[2020]], the day [[COVID]]-19 vaccination was started, were included. Any subject who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days earlier was considered previously infected. One was considered vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 m[[RNA]] [[vaccine]]. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection over the next five months, among previously infected subjects who received the [[vaccine]], was compared with those of previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated, previously uninfected subjects who received the [[vaccine]], and previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. **Results.** Among the 52238 included employees, 1359 (53%) of 2579 previously infected subjects remained unvaccinated, compared with 22777 (41%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained almost zero among previously infected unvaccinated subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, compared with a steady increase in cumulative incidence among previously uninfected subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, after adjusting for the phase of the [[epidemic]], vaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not previously infected (HR 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR 0.313, 95% CI 0 to Infinity). **Conclusions.** Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from [[COVID]]-19 vaccination, and [[vaccine]]s can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.
