It is fairly well-accepted that [[America]]n [[slavery]] of the 19th century developed 
from three distinct traditions of [[slavery]] that were mutated into a new, 
racialized, institutionalized form: [[Europe]]an indentured servitude, West [[Africa]]n 
[[slavery]], and southeastern [[Native]] [[America]]n slave trading. Of these, the last is 
probably the least well-known, despite it being essential to understanding how 
[[slavery]] as it’s popularly known became such an economic force in the southeast. 
So this is a brief overview of southeastern [[slavery]] before [[1800]].
 
[[Indigenous]] Traditions of Slavery
 
The period from 900 to [[1700]] CE in the southeast is known as the Mississippian 
period. During this time, people lived primarily in provinces composed of towns 
that paid tribute to a mico, or chief, who inherited his position through the 
maternal line. Power was established through deeds of war, so provinces 
frequently fought with one another. As a part of this, captives were often 
taken, although frequently in earlier times even women and [[child]]ren were [[kill]]ed 
rather than taken captive. These war captives were given to wealthy people in 
the provinces for workers. Being a slave was defined by being not a part of the 
kinship system, which was essential to society. Lacking kinship connections, 
[[slaves]] were isolated. However, by adoption or marriage they could become part of
a clan and thus leave their state of [[slavery]] by entering the kinship system.
 
This was the state that the [[South]]east was in when Hernan De Soto visited it with
his army. During the years after his visit, Mississippian society began to 
disintegrate for reasons that aren’t totally understood. De Soto, whose army was
used by some micos to attack other chiefdoms, may have destabilized 
relationships between provinces, or disease may have spread in the aftermath. 
Internal pressures likely played a part. Regardless of why, the fact is that by 
the [[1600]]s, people in the [[South]]east were living far more spread out, often on 
more isolated farmsteads. Though clan, kinship, and micos continued to be 
important, their role was different than it had previously been.
 
The [[Indian]] Slave Trade
 
It was the entrance of the English trading system beginning around [[1650]] that 
sparked the creation of intensive slave trading in the south. The English needed
workers for their [[plantation]]s in the southeast and in the Caribbean, and [[Native]] 
people desired [[Europe]]an goods both for an advantage in war and for prestige in 
their community. In order to acquire these goods, several [[Native]] communities 
began to focus heavily on raiding for captives to sell to the English. In the 
north, the Haudenosaunee were the most feared raiders; in the south the 
Occaneechis and Westos became major slave [[trade]]rs. Later more interior groups 
such as the Chickasaw would take over.
 
Between the constant slave raids and disease, huge changes occurred in the 
[[South]]eastern world, with entire societies devastated from the population loss. 
This wasn’t a minor thing, it was a region-encompassing issue that affected the 
lives of practically every [[indigenous]] person. In the wake of this, new 
confederations appeared, both to engage in the slave [[trade]] and to protect from 
it: the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee, Catawba, and others emerged with new 
political systems. These groups fiercely defended their claims to large tracts 
of land in the interior, keeping [[Europe]]ans on the coast.
 
The Decline of the [[Indian]] Slave Trade
 
By the [[1700]]s, there was a demographic crisis in the [[South]]east, and [[Europe]]ans had
begun important enslaved [[Africa]]ns at a significantly higher rate to keep up with
their needed labor power. Multiple groups began to develop racialized senses of 
self at this time. [[Native]]s in the east frequently espoused the idea that the 
Creator had made three races–White, Red, and Black–and had given each their own 
place as a way to defend their right to their land. However, as [[slavery]] of 
[[Africa]]ns became more institutionalized and [[Native]] elites became more 
acculturated, this same rhetoric was used to assert that Black people were 
inherently enslavable.
 
Despite this, [[Indian]] and Black people continued to work as [[slaves]] in fairly 
significant numbers alongside each other up until the Removals of the [[1830]]s, 
while [[Native]] people also continued to own Black [[slaves]] until emancipation three 
decades later. For [[Europe]]ans, one of the original concerns that led to focusing 
on [[slavery]] of [[Africa]]ns rather than [[Indian]]s was the fact that escaping from 
[[slavery]] was much easier when one had a community to escape to. The close 
intertwining of Black and [[Indian]] communities thus threatened the system of 
[[slavery]] as a whole. In addition, the land owned by [[Indian]] people was highly 
desired by [[white]] colonists. The forced removal of [[Indian]] people opened space for
larger [[plantation]]s and severed the ease with which enslaved people could escape.
(Which isn’t to say that Black people were necessarily treated well in [[Native]] 
communities–the later the period, the more [[Native]] communities in the southeast 
had developed and adopted anti-Black attitudes. “Running away to [[Indian]] 
Territory” continued to be remembered as a path to freedom all the way into the 
20th century, though.) It was this process that allowed the creation of the 
massive [[plantation]]s of the [[1800]]s.
 
The ways that [[slavery]] and colonization of [[Native]] [[America]]n lands are intertwined 
are only starting to be examined relatively recently, due to the removal of 
[[Native]] people from the east and their subsequent erasure from eastern [[history]], 
and the general lack of study of Black-[[Indian]] relations. Both of these things 
are major gaps in the popular understanding of [[America]]n [[history]] that need to be 
rectified.
