[[Cree]] Discourse and Narrative

Ways of Knowing
Angela Van Essen

[[Cree]] narrative memory is essentially open-ended

—Neal McLeod, "[[Cree]] Poetic Discourse"

Ifs the hottest day [[Winnipeg]] has seen in twenty years, and the rivers are

swollen, washing away the walking trails that ran beside them through
the city. As a non-[[Native]] student who is about to begin PhD work on
contemporary [[Cree]] literature at the University of Alberta, I am keenly
aware of my status as a guest on this campus and in this city. Not only
am I blundering my way through these buildings, looking for a room in

St John's College, but I realize that I don't know the stories behind the
names of many of these landmarks: who was Elizabeth Dafoe? Why is
the library here named after her? And who was Lagimodière, and why
is this boulevard named after him? Why is Chief Peguis remembered
in the name of the "trail" that runs through the city? The name of this
city, [[Winnipeg]], is a [[Cree]] word, meaning "dirty water." With some newly

acquired linguistic knowledge I figure that the name comes from the
morpheme win which means dirty, and nipiy, which is [[Cree]] for water,
and the locative or territorial suffix -îhk (put together would be wîti
nipîhk), but Arok Wolvengrey's dictionary spells it wînipêk. This name,

like a story, is one that I will circle for years. Much later I learn from
Neal McLeod that the pê in wînipêk is a stem used to describe water. But,

he says, you can never just have a name, just a word. You always need
the story behind it. And in the days to come, after that first sweltering

day in [[Winnipeg]], I will hear Louis Bird tell us a story about how Lake
[[Winnipeg]] got that name.
But on this very first day, in a stuffy classroom at the University of

[[Manitoba]], we are sitting in a sticky circle, on plastic chairs. However,
I forget my sweaty back when Louis Bird begins to speak: "So I, any
way, I have listened to many, many legends in our area. Different kind.

Different ways of saying. Different people, different ways of saying."

He pauses and apologizes for his broken English. A graduate student
from India studying at the University of [[Toronto]] leans forward in his
chair, earnest to praise his "subversive syntax" and "resistant use of
the English language." Louis is silent. For a moment no one speaks. My
bum prickles. Postcolonial theory sounds pretentious at this moment,
and only seems to widen the gap between academic discourse and [[Cree]]
oral literature. That moment, between the graduate student's eager re
sponse to Louis Bird's apology and what happened next opened up so
many doors in my mind: in this paper I want to linger in the doorway
of four of those spaces.
The Doorway between Standard Written English and Good Storytelling

First, I thought of the door between languages, and the power of Stan
dard English. Clearly Louis Bird was not using the English language
subversively; he was not making grammatical errors to resist the au
thority of Standard Written English. However, his speech prompted
me to remember that Bird is speaking in a language that is foreign to
him, thus reminding me that these stories are told in translation, and
that his perspective and his linguistic background are not the same as
mine. The graduate studenf s comments also reminded me that master
ing Standard Written English is a key to power. Most academic audi
ences will only respect your words if they are, at the very least, strung

together in error-free prose. Chris Anson explores the tension between
good storytelling and correct prose in his narrative essay "Beginnings"
where he reflects on his experience as a fledgling teacher reading a rivet

ing student narrative full of glaring mistakes and nonstandard syntax:
I read the paper avidly, in spite of the many grammatical errors.
... there was a kind of leanness to the descriptions that seemed
almost deliberate... But what then to do about all the errors? (63)

Perhaps the graduate student in our seminar felt similarly torn: he
respected Louis Bird, and he wanted to learn from him and his stories,
but he also respected error-free speech; to relieve this tension, he con
cluded that Bird must have been using broken English subversively.
Or perhaps he felt a clear connection between his experience as an
[[Indian]] growing up under the dominance of the colonizer's language
and Louis Bird's experience as a [[Cree]] storyteller speaking in English
in a [[Canadian]] university classroom.
Mastery of Standard English is a source of power and authority in
[[North]] [[America]]n culture (it is also a source of power all over the world:
my experience teaching English as a Subsequent Language in [[South]]
[[[[Korea]]]] made this clear to me). But Louis Bird filled the room with a dif

ferent kind of authority. We all listened to him. Why? We listened not
because his grammar was perfect or his prose eloquent, but because he
was a good storyteller, we respected him, and his stories held wisdom.
Rhetorical Traditions: The Doorway between Nehiyaw and [[Western]]
Academic approaches to Knowledge and Learning

Despite the awkward silence that afternoon, I found it intriguing that
no one intervened or tried to correct anyone. This silence reminded
me of the way Dorothy Thunder, my [[Cree]] language professor at the
University of Alberta, handles disagreement or error in her classroom.
There, whenever we answer a question incorrectly, she remains silent.
She waits for someone to say the right answer. When she hears it she
smiles: "kwayaskl" she says. "Good job." At first, I felt disoriented by
her approach. I wanted to be corrected if I made a mistake. But over
time I grew to appreciate her nonassertive method, for, as James (Sâkéj)

Youngblood Henderson explains, [[Aboriginal]] teachers and leaders "seek
to persuade through example but not to command" (270). Instead of
debating or arguing, [[Cree]] teachers are more interested in meeting their

audiences and students where they are; they want to establish mutual
thinking. Eugene Gendlin analyzes the intricacy of mutual understand
ing and suggests that this complex process is foundational for dialogue
and meaning-making ("Reply to Wallulis," qtd. in Sargent 176). But
[[Cree]] discourse assumes more than intellectual mutual thinking: there
is an ethical element to a [[Cree]] understanding of this concept. As Walter
Lightning explains, "it is assumed that there will be effort to think mutu
ally with the Elder. The assumption is that active attention, humility of
the hearer, and respect for the Elder, will put one in the frame of mind

where the minds can meet" (62).

This primary [[Cree]] assumption stands in stark contrast to many
forms of academic discourse and [[Western]] rhetoric. In the weeks prior to

Louis Bird's seminar, I took a Linguistics course entitled "The Structure

of the [[Cree]] Language." There we spent one day looking at different
genres in [[Cree]], and for part of that class we also talked about rhetoric.
The professor, Jeffery Muehlbauer, contrasted traditional western Ar
istotelian rhetoric, where the goal is to persuade, with [[Cree]] rhetoric.
He suggested that the usual goal in [[Cree]] rhetoric is not an aggressive
persuasion, but rather an establishment of mutual understanding and
knowledge ([[August]] 6, [[2010]], lecture). Indeed, as Youngblood Hender
son explains, knowledge is gained in traditional Algonquian cultures
through "intimate and endless listening to stories and dialogue with

elders and parents each thematic repetition or spiral add[s] a little.
This can be contrasted with the step-by-step, linear progression of an
Aristotelian argument" (266).
Relationality: The Doorway between the Speaker and the Listener

In her essay, "Negotiating a Different Terrain: Geographical and Edu
cational Cross-Border Difficulties," Loraine [[May]]er tells the story of her

struggles as an [[Aboriginal]] student earning a degree in a mainstream
academic institution. She found herself pulled by opposing traditions
of education when she tried to write, so that the brutal and competitive

nature of her western academic training caused her to write "lengthy
and cruel rhetoric" (103). However, when she got "back to her right

mind," recalling her No'khum (her [[Cree]] grandmother), she would
delete the venomous writing and start again (103). She realized that her
goal as a writer was to build dialogue, and the vitriolic language she
had been using in her competitive frame of mind was only destroying
dialogue (104). It seems to me that her story illustrates that establishing

dialogue is a core value in [[Cree]] discourse, and this value assumes an
audience who is willing to think along with the speaker. This brought
me back to Louis Bird's storytelling, and prompted me to wonder how
[[Cree]] speakers, storytellers, and writers go about establishing authority
and mutual thinking. Often, in [[Cree]] stories and speeches, experiential

knowledge is crucial. Speakers use their own experience to explain
how they know what they know; this is sometimes established through
chains of information: they will identify in[[flu]]ential teachers, parents,
Elders, and storytellers (Muehlbauer, [[August]] 6,[[2010]], lecture).
Some composition theorists, such as Carolyn Matalene, have sug
gested that keeping "the personal in one compartment and the imper
sonal in another is not only bad writing instruction, but also immoral"
(223). However, this view is not always respected or understood in
mainstream academic discourse. For example, [[May]]er describes how
she felt "continually frustrated ... having to defend my claims, when
all I wanted was to tell a story, especially when the claims were from
lived experience" (102). Similarly, Janice Acoose recalls how she "had

experiences with readers/critics who too often dismiss[ed] as 'uncriti
cal' or 'romantic/ nostalgic' [her] lived experiences, which are rooted in
Nêhiyawak-Métis-Nahkawè cultures" (217). Far from being uncritical
or romantic, Neal McLeod asserts
Instead of theory being abstracted and detached from concrete
experience, theory (critical poetic consciousness) emerges out of
concrete situations and through conversation and storyteller. (117)

These [[Cree]] writers' and theorists' emphasis on the importance of personal

experience, culture, and conversation supports the writing of personal
narrative in the classroom and in academic discourse. Indeed, leading
composition theorist Wendy [[Bishop]] concludes that "real moments of

the writing classroom [include]... the enlivened unwrapping of
narratives and histories and tastes and experiences that are shared
there—relationships between people, words, places, work, and won
der" (200). Perhaps [[Bishop]]'s experiences with "real moments" can be
understood more clearly if we understand learning as funda[[mental]]ly
relational. Lightning's relationship with the late Elder Louis Sun[[child]]
taught him that
learning is not a product of transferring information between a
teacher and a student. It is a product of creation and re-creation,
in a mutual relationship of personal interaction, of information.
It is not just a cognitive ([[mental]]) act, but an emotional—thus
physical—act. Learning is felt. It is a sensation. It is something
that involves emotions. And as the elder here points out, learning
is ideally a spiritual thing, because the compassionate mind is one
that is spiritually centred. (64)

directly, but he also says they are teaching tools (www.ourvoices.ca,
[[February]] 17,[[2003]]).
An early draft of this essay was called "A Story and Four Lessons,"
and my plan was to tell one of the stories I had learned from Louis Bird,

pull out four lessons from it, and apply them to alternative discourses
and narrative ways of knowing. At first I felt excited and confident in
this task: I had heard the story from a respected [[Cree]] storyteller, I had
worked at memorizing it and telling it correctly, and I had been thinking
about the story for several months. I really wanted to explore how [[Cree]]

intellectual traditions could teach me about discourse and knowledge.
But when I went back to the story, I began to feel unprepared. I knew
that I didn't totally understand the story. I didn't know what the story

could teach me, but I wanted to learn. I took courage from Gian Pag
nucci's assertion that "stories connect what we know to what we're
trying to understand. They make things personal, give things mean
ing. They make things matter" (9). But I had a cold hard feeling in my
chest, as if there were a metal rod lying there against my sternum. I
felt like I sometimes do when I read some of those parables that Jesus
told. Sometimes, when we are honest, those stories don't make sense. I
also worried that I was making a mistake in [[Cree]] protocol: even though
Louis Bird had given us permission to re-tell a story if we worked hard
at memorizing it, and if we told it to our friends, I wasn't sure if it was
okay to bring that story into an academic setting.
I put those nagging feelings behind me because my rough draft
was due in a few days. I had four lessons, and in my mind they were
clearly connected to both the theories and the story: first, you should
be curious—wonder, my grandfatherly uncle is fond of reminding me,
is the beginning of wisdom; second, you should listen to your elders,
your relations, your sisters; third, you should stay humble no matter
how much you learn and no matter how powerful you become; finally,
you should leave some things alone. I built my first draft around the

lessons that I learned from the story. But this structure was not clear
to my fellow classmates or to my professor, and I returned to my com
puter with a rough draft covered in red ink. When I came across Walter

Lightning's dissertation and read the following story, that cold metal
rod (that had remained in my chest since I wrote the draft) melted away:

I can honestly say that I don't understand the story. Not yet, anyway.
I am still too young.
The Elder than (sic) took a stick about 16 inches long from the
ground a few feet away from where they were sitting on the grass.

He then scratched a notch at about the middle of the stick and
then indicating one end of the stick and that notched mark said,

'This is when you are born and this notch is 50 years old. In this
area between being born up to 50 years of age, you do not know
anything." He then proceeded to point from the notch at the middle
of the stick to the other end and stated that from 50 years of age
to 100 years of age you can say that you begin to have a hunch,
an intuitive feeling, for knowledge. From 100 years of age and
on, you then have entered an area, a stage in your life, where you
know something. (14)

Lightning's story about the Elder's understanding of knowledge re
minded me of one of Louis Bird's lessons on stories. He told us on that
first sweltering day that all of his stories have at least four versions:
there is the version he tells to [[child]]ren, then there is the version he tells

to young [[adults]], next is a version he tells to people who have grown
[[child]]ren of their own, and finally there is a version that only old people
know. These stories are not meant to be understood all at once. To truly

understand these stories takes a lifetime. Perhaps this is the beginning
of wisdom: admit that you know nothing. Carry the stories with you.
Live. Learn. Remember. Re-imagine.
