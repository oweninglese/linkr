Alier Marrero is stumped.

For years, the neurologist in Moncton, [[New]] [[Brunswick]], has seen patients with symptoms common to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a fatal brain disorder that affects one in 1 million people each year.

But diagnostic [[testing]] for the rare neurodegenerative syndrome keeps coming back negative, more patients with similar symptoms have turned up each year, and Marrero hasn’t found another cause. Federal public [[health]] officials last year identified the cases as a cluster meriting further investigation.

Now Marrero and scientists and doctors from [[Canada]] and around the world are playing detective in a medical whodunit, racing to untangle the cause of the brain disorder that has afflicted 48 people, six of whom have died, in the Moncton area and [[New]] [[Brunswick]]’s Acadian peninsula.

Those afflicted with the condition — called the [[New]] [[Brunswick]] Cluster of Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause, for now — have ranged in age from 18 to 85. Symptoms began in [[2018]] and onward for many of them, but one case in [[2015]] was identified retrospectively last year.

“The suffering is immense … because it’s beyond physical,” said Marrero, who works at Moncton’s Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Center. “There’s also the neuropsychiatric and moral suffering of the patients that is only partially relieved by medications.”

An otherwise [[health]]y 75-year-old woman arrived at the Dumont emergency department last [[June]]. For months, she had experienced unexplained weight loss and what she described to her daughter as a “trembling sensation” inside her body. Her legs felt heavy. One arm was shaking involuntarily.

The daughter said her mother is one of the cases under investigation.

“My mother goes to bed at night and questions herself: ‘Am I going to wake up tomorrow, and if I do wake up tomorrow, am I going to be able to walk or talk?'” she said. “Because there’s no answers. Nobody knows anything. There’s no reasoning. There’s nothing.”

Patients experience a constellation of symptoms, Marrero said, usually beginning with atypical anxiety, depression and muscle aches or spasms. They develop sleep disorders, including insomnia so severe that they sleep only a few nights a week or not at all, even with medication. Their brains are atrophied.

Many experience blurred vision, memory problems, teeth chattering, hair loss and trouble with balance. Some, including those in palliative care being administered strong medications, suffer from uncontrollable muscle jerks. Others have rapid and unexplained weight loss and muscle atrophy.

Some have hallucinations, including what Marrero said are “terrifying hallucinatory dreams” that leave them afraid to go to sleep, and tactile hallucinations in which they feel as if insects are crawling on them. One symptom, particularly devastating for loved ones, is Capgras delusion, a belief that family members have been replaced by impostors.

“The rapidity in the constellation of features is something that — I’ve not seen this before,” said Michael Strong, the neurologist who heads the [[Canadian]] Institutes of Health [[Research]].

The cluster was detected by the federal public [[health]] agency’s Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance system, which monitors for CJD and other prion disorders. They occur when [[prions]], misfolded proteins, build up and cause normal proteins in the brain to misfold. Under a microscope, the brains of people and animals with prion disorders resemble sponges with small holes.

Michael Coulthart, who heads the surveillance system, said it’s notified of many suspected cases each year, but only a tiny number are confirmed. The system has identified 36 “definite and probable” cases of CJD in [[New]] [[Brunswick]] since 1[[998]].

The system doesn’t typically follow up on unconfirmed cases; the physician treating the patient is left to search for another diagnosis.

Marrero, with one such case in [[2015]], couldn’t find a satisfying diagnosis. From [[2018]] on, patients kept showing up with similar symptoms. In [[2019]], there were 11 cases in [[New]] [[Brunswick]] that would later be identified as part of the cluster. In [[2020]], there were 24. Marrero and Coulthart thought they could be dealing with something new.

“We say that they were resistant to diagnosis,” Coulthart said. “That’s what had to emerge as a pattern before we started talking about a cluster.”

Scientists believe the syndrome has a two-year incubation period. They’re pursuing every clue — sleuthing through environ[[mental]] exposures to travel histories to diets — to determine its etiology.

Marrero has tested his patients’ blood and screened for the presence of zoonotic infectious diseases known to cause neurological symptoms. He’s looked for auto[[immune]] disorders, metabolic deficits and cancer. His patients undergo genetic [[testing]]. None of it has brought an answer.

Testing cerebrospinal [[flu]]id for elevated levels of protein markers can help diagnose CJD in life, but Marrero’s patients are negative. Brain autopsies for three of the dead — the [[gold]] standard for confirming a diagnosis — have displayed no hint of a known prion disorder. Molecular [[testing]] of those samples is underway.

“These cases for all intents and purposes by their description should be CJD,” Strong said. “That’s what they sound like and are presenting like, and yet the [[testing]] is negative.”

One theory is that the syndrome is caused by an entirely new prion disorder. Another is that it’s tied to exposure to an environ[[mental]] toxin.

One toxin that has come under scrutiny is beta-Methylamino-L-alanine, which is produced by cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae blooms. Another is domoic acid, a naturally occurring toxin produced by certain types of algae, that was responsible for a deadly contaminated seafood outbreak in [[Canada]] in [[1987]].

In Caraquet, a town of some 4,200 people in the Acadian peninsula, [[May]]or Kevin Haché said “the biggest problem is the unknown.”

“The population is in shock,” Haché said, “to realize that there’s a sickness out there, and we don’t know anything about it, and we don’t know where it’s coming from, and we don’t know what to do to protect ourselves from it.”

Across the border in Maine, officials say their disease surveillance and epidemiology teams learned about the cluster in [[March]]. Robert Long, a spokesman for the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said no cases with similar characteristics have been reported in the state.

[[New]] [[Brunswick]] has fared relatively well against the [[corona[[virus]]]], but the scientists and doctors who are investigating the new syndrome say it has slowed their work.

“The [[pandemic]] has put many wrenches in the works,” said Neil Cashman, a neurologist at the University of [[British]] Columbia. He’s advising the investigation, mostly over Zoom.

Strong agreed.

“The worst time for this to have happened is in the middle of a [[pandemic]],” he said.

When the [[corona[[virus]]]] hit, many nonemergency procedures, including diagnostic imaging and spinal taps, were temporarily canceled. Some patients feared seeking medical aid because they worried about contracting the [[virus]], Marrero said.

[[New]] [[Brunswick]]’s travel restrictions and quarantine rules have complicated efforts to get epidemiologists on the ground to take environ[[mental]] samples and interview residents.

“[[New]] [[Brunswick]] has been able to divert some new resources to the issue as it gradually became more and more recognized as needing constant attention,” Coulthart said. “But I don’t think we still have all the people engaged that we’re going to have.”

Some in the province have expressed frustration at what they’ve said is a lack of transparency from the [[government]]. The CJD surveillance system brought the province into its investigation in [[December]], and a draft case definition was compiled in [[January]]. But the public wasn’t made aware of the cluster until mid-[[March]], when the [[Canadian]] Broadcasting Corp. reported on a memo about the cases sent to [[New]] [[Brunswick]] physicians that month.

When a reporter at a news conference on the [[corona[[virus]]]] asked if officials could address the “news of this mysterious neurological syndrome,” Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of [[health]], confirmed that more than 40 cases were under investigation.

A spokeswoman for [[New]] [[Brunswick]]’s [[health]] department did not respond to a question about why the public first learned about the cluster in a media report.

“The Department of Health is committed to continue working closely with our provincial and federal partners to explore and identify all potential causes including food, environ[[mental]] and animal exposures,” spokeswoman Abigail McCarthy said.

Coulthart said the attention the cluster is now drawing leaves him “confident that, in the end, we’re going to arrive at an answer.”

Marrero says he tries to sound an optimistic note with his patients and their families.

“Fear is understandable,” he said. “But we are working for hope.”
