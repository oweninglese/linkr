# Advanced persistent threat - Wikipedia

> ## Excerpt
> An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a stealthy threat actor, typically a nation state or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period.[1][2] In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.[3]

---
An **advanced persistent threat** (**APT**) is a stealthy [threat actor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threat_actor "Threat actor"), typically a [nation state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state "Nation state") or state-sponsored group, which gains unauthorized access to a [[[computer]] network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network") and remains undetected for an extended period.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-2) In recent times, the term may also refer to non-state-sponsored groups conducting large-scale targeted intrusions for specific goals.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:0-3)

Such threat actors' motivations are typically political or economic. Every major [business sector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_sector "Business sector") has recorded instances of [cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack "Cyberattack") by advanced actors with specific goals, whether to steal, [[spy]], or disrupt. These targeted sectors include [[government]], [defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry "Arms industry"), [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services "Financial services"), [legal services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law "Practice of law"), industrial, [telecoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication "Telecommunication"), consumer goods and many more.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:2-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-6) Some groups utilize traditional [espionage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage "Espionage") vectors, including [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) "Social engineering (security)"), [human intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_intelligence_(intelligence_gathering) "Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)") and [infiltration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiltration_tactics "Infiltration tactics") to gain access to a physical location to enable network attacks. The purpose of these attacks is to install custom [malware (malicious software)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware "Malware").[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-7)

The median "dwell-time", the time an APT attack goes undetected, differs widely between regions. [FireEye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FireEye "FireEye") reported the mean dwell-time for [[2018]] in the [[[America]]s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[[America]]s "[[America]]s") as 71 days, [EMEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[[Europe]],_the_Middle_East_and_[[Africa]] "[[Europe]], the Middle East and [[Africa]]") as 177 days, and [APAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-[[Pacific]] "Asia-[[Pacific]]") as 204 days.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:2-4) Such a long dwell-time allows attackers a significant amount of time to go through the attack cycle, propagate, and achieve their objective.

## Definition\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advanced_persistent_threat&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Definition")\]

Definitions of precisely what an APT is can vary, but can be summarized by their named requirements below:

-   _Advanced_ – Operators behind the threat have a full spectrum of intelligence-gathering techniques at their disposal. These may include commercial and open source [[computer]] intrusion technologies and techniques, but may also extend to include the intelligence apparatus of a state. While individual components of the attack may not be considered particularly "advanced" (e.g. [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware "Malware") components generated from commonly available do-it-yourself malware construction kits, or the use of easily procured exploit materials), their operators can typically access and develop more advanced tools as required. They often combine multiple targeting methods, tools, and techniques in order to reach and compromise their target and maintain access to it. Operators may also demonstrate a deliberate focus on operational security that differentiates them from "less advanced" threats.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:0-3)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:1-8)[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-9)
-   _Persistent_ – Operators have specific objectives, rather than opportunistically seeking information for financial or other gain. This distinction implies that the attackers are guided by external entities. The targeting is conducted through continuous monitoring and interaction in order to achieve the defined objectives. It does not mean a barrage of constant attacks and malware updates. In fact, a "low-and-slow" approach is usually more successful. If the operator loses access to their target they usually will reattempt access, and most often, successfully. One of the operator's goals is to maintain long-term access to the target, in contrast to threats who only need access to execute a specific task.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:1-8)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-10)
-   _Threat_ – APTs are a threat because they have both capability and intent. APT attacks are executed by coordinated human actions, rather than by mindless and automated pieces of code. The operators have a specific objective and are s[[kill]]ed, motivated, organized and well funded. Actors are not limited to state sponsored groups.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:0-3)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-:1-8)

## History and targets\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advanced_persistent_threat&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: History and targets")\]

[[War]]nings against targeted, socially-engineered emails dropping trojans to exfiltrate sensitive information were published by [[UK]] and US [CERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team "Computer emergency response team") organisations in [[2005]]. This method was used throughout the early [[1990]]s and does not in itself constitute an APT. The term "advanced persistent threat" has been cited as originating from the [[[United]] [[States]] Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[[United]]_[[States]]_Air_Force "[[United]] [[States]] Air Force") in [[2006]][\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-11) with Colonel Greg Rattray cited as the individual who coined the term.[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-12)

The [Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet "Stuxnet") [[[computer]] worm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm "Computer worm"), which targeted the [[computer]] hardware of [[[Iran]]'s [[nuclear]] program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[[Iran]]%27s_[[nuclear]]_program "[[Iran]]'s [[nuclear]] program"), is one example of an APT attack. In this case, the [[Iran]]ian [[government]] might consider the Stuxnet creators to be an advanced persistent threat.\[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[[Wikipedia]]:Citation_needed "[[Wikipedia]]:Citation needed")_\][\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-13)

Within the [[[computer]] security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") community, and increasingly within the media, the term is almost always used in reference to a long-term pattern of sophisticated [[computer]] network exploitation aimed at [[government]]s, [[companies]], and political activists, and by extension, also to ascribe the A, P and T attributes to the groups behind these attacks.[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-14) Advanced persistent threat (APT) as a term may be shifting focus to [[computer]]-based hacking due to the rising number of occurrences. [PC World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World "PC World") reported an 81 percent increase from [[2010]] to [[2011]] of particularly advanced targeted [[computer]] attacks.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-15)

Actors in many countries have used [cyberspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace "Cyberspace") as a means to gather intelligence on individuals and groups of individuals of interest.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-16)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-18) The [[[United]] [[States]] Cyber Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[[United]]_[[States]]_Cyber_Command "[[United]] [[States]] Cyber Command") is tasked with coordinating the US military's offensive and defensive [cyber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber-Attacks "Cyber-Attacks") operations.[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-19)

Numerous sources have alleged that some APT groups are affiliated with, or are agents of, [[government]]s of [sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state "Sovereign state").[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-20)[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-21)[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-22) Businesses holding a large quantity of [personally identifiable information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personally_identifiable_information "Personally identifiable information") are at high risk of being targeted by advanced persistent threats, including:[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-Dell_SecureWorks-23)

-   Higher education[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-24)
-   [Financial institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution "Financial institution")
-   Energy
-   [Transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport "Transport")
-   [[Technology]]
-   Health care
-   Telecommunications
-   Manufacturing
-   Agriculture[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-Cybersecurity:_Current_Writings_on_Threats_and_Protection_[[2019]]-25)

A Bell [[Canada]] study provided deep [[research]] into the anatomy of APTs and uncovered widespread presence in [[Canadian]] [[government]] and critical infrastructure. Attribution was established to [[Chinese]] and [[Russia]]n actors.[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-26)

## Life cycle\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advanced_persistent_threat&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Life cycle")\]

[![Diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat (APT) which repeats itself once complete.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Advanced_persistent_threat_lifecycle.jpg "Diagram depicting the life cycle staged approach of an advanced persistent threat (APT) which repeats itself once complete.")

Actors behind advanced persistent threats create a growing and changing risk to organizations' financial assets, intellectual [[property]], and reputation[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-27) by following a continuous process or [[[kill]] chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_chain "Kill chain"):

1.  Target specific organizations for a singular objective
2.  Attempt to gain a foothold in the environment (common tactics include [spear phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_phishing "Spear phishing") emails)
3.  Use the compromised systems as access into the target network
4.  Deploy additional tools that help fulfill the attack objective
5.  Cover tracks to maintain access for future initiatives

The global landscape of APT's from all sources is sometimes referred to in the singular as "the" APT, as are references to the actor behind a specific incident or series of incidents, but the definition of APT includes both actor and method.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-EMAGCOMSECURITY-28)

In [[2013]], Mandiant presented results of their [[research]] on alleged [[Chinese]] attacks using APT method between [[2004]] and [[2013]][\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-mandiant-29) that followed similar lifecycle:

-   **Initial compromise** – performed by use of [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security) "Social engineering (security)") and [spear phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear_phishing "Spear phishing"), over email, using [zero-day [[virus]]es](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-day_[[virus]] "Zero-day [[virus]]"). Another popular infection method was planting [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware "Malware") on a website that the victim's employees will be likely to visit.
-   **Establish foothold** – plant [remote administration software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_administration_software "Remote administration software") in victim's network, create net backdoors and tunnels allowing stealth access to its infrastructure.
-   **Escalate privileges** – use [exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_([[computer]]_security) "Exploit ([[computer]] security)") and [password cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking "Password cracking") to acquire administrator privileges over victim's [[computer]] and possibly expand it to [Windows domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_domain "Windows domain") administrator accounts.
-   **Internal reconnaissance** – collect information on surrounding infrastructure, trust relationships, [Windows domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_domain "Windows domain") structure.
-   **Move laterally** – expand control to other workstations, servers and infrastructure elements and perform data harvesting on them.
-   **Maintain presence** – ensure continued control over access channels and credentials acquired in previous steps.
-   **Complete mission** – exfiltrate stolen data from victim's network.

In incidents analysed by Mandiant, the average period over which the attackers controlled the victim's network was one year, with longest – almost five years.[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-mandiant-29) The infiltrations were allegedly performed by Shanghai-based [Unit 61398](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLA_Unit_61398 "PLA Unit 61398") of [People's Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army "People's Liberation Army"). [[Chinese]] officials have denied any involvement in these attacks.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-30)

Previous reports from Secdev had previously discovered and implicated [[Chinese]] actors.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-31)

## Mitigation strategies\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Advanced_persistent_threat&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Mitigation strategies")\]

There are tens of millions of malware variations,[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-GSEC_GIAC_Security_Essentials_Certification_All_[[2013]]-32) which makes it extremely challenging to protect organizations from APT. While APT activities are stealthy and hard to detect, the [command and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control_(malware) "Command and control (malware)") network traffic associated with APT can be detected at the network layer level with sophisticated methods. Deep log analyses and log correlation from various sources is of limited usefulness in detecting APT activities. It is challenging to separate noises from legitimate traffic. Traditional security technology and methods have been ineffective in detecting or mitigating APTs.[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-33) Active cyber defense has yielded greater efficacy in detecting and prosecuting APTs (find, fix, finish) when applying [cyber threat intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_threat_intelligence "Cyber threat intelligence") to hunt and adversary pursuit activities.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-34)[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat#cite_note-35)
