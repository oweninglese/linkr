HUDSON'S BAY COMPANY CLAIMS, [[1846]]-69
By RALPH RICHARD MARTIG

THE CHARTER of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company dates from the

year [[1670]], when Charles II granted to "The [[Governor]] and

Company of Adventurers trading into Hudson's [[Bay]]" a vast
extent of territory, in perpetuity, henceforth to be "reckoned
and reputed as one of our [[plantation]]s or colonies in [[America]],
called 'Rupert's Land'." Joined to this vast grant of territory
were rights of [[government]], of the administration of justice in
civil and criminal cases, of maintaining an army and navy, and
of making "war or peace with any prince or people whatso
ever, that are not Christians." These ample powers fell short
only of paramount [[sovereignty]].
The [[company]], however, was not destined to hold its powers

and advantages free from challenge and dispute. In [[1783]],

long before the [[company]] had extended its possessions beyond
the territorial limits indicated by its charter (the territory

which drained into Hudson [[Bay]]), a rival had sprung up in

the old [[North]] West Company of Montreal. In a few years,
that association absorbed into itself all the minor fur trading
associations and, by agreement with the new [[North]] West Com
pany, [[1804]], the powerful body simply known as the [[North]]

West Company was formed. This [[company]] pushed its [[trade]]
across the Rocky Mountains and established its first post on
Fraser Lake, in the year [[1806]]; the posts at Kootenai and Flat
head were built in [[1808]]. Thence extending southward, it ac
quired by purchase from the [[Pacific]] Fur Company, [[1813]], the
posts at Okanagan and Astoria (Fort George). The rivalry
between the two [[companies]] became so intense that it assumed
the form of open [[warfare]], and, at the instance of Lord Bat
hurst, colonial secretary, an agreement was made whereby the

[[North]] West Company was merged into the Hudson's [[Bay]]

Company. An act of [[parliament]] confirmed the union.
Letters patent, granted by the crown in [[1821]] and renewed
in [[1838]], gave to the union [[company]] an exclusive right of [[trade]]
against all persons other than [[America]]n citizens; the license
was limited to a 21-year period, and the exception in favor of
[[America]]ns was necessary because of the joint occupation agree

ment under which the Oregon country was held. During the
period from [[1821]] to [[1846]], the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company greatly
extended its operations over the Oregon country, until its es
tablishments extended from Fort Hall, some 200 miles from
Salt Lake City, to Fort Simpson, near the [[Russia]]n ([[Alaska]])

border.

Sovereign jurisdiction over the Oregon country, that terri
tory which comprises the states of Oregon, [[Washington]], and
Idaho, and the province of [[British]] Columbia, was claimed by
both [[Great]] [[Britain]] and the [[United]] [[States]]. During the period
from [[1818]] to [[1846]], though title had not been determined, a
temporary settlement had been reached through an arrange

ment for joint occupation. By the [[treaty]] of [[1846]], that por
tion of the country, in which the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company had
its most valuable establishments, was awarded to the [[United]]
[[States]], and [[Great]] [[Britain]] relinquished all claims to territory

south of the 49th parallel of north latitude. In that settle

ment, however, care was taken by the [[British]] [[government]] to
obtain from the [[United]] [[States]] a sufficient guarantee of the
[[company]]'s rights. Article II provided that the navigation of
the Columbia River should remain free and open to the Hud
son's [[Bay]] Company and to all [[British]] subjects trading with

them; under article III, the [[America]]n [[government]] pledged
itself to respect the possessory rights of the Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company and of all [[British]] subjects who may be already in the
occupation of land or other [[property]] lawfully acquired within
the said territory, and article IV confirmed the Puget Sound
Agricultural Company's (a subsidiary [[company]]) title to its
farms, lands and other [[property]] of every description on the
north side of the Columbia River. It further provided that,
should the situation of these farms and lands be considered by
the [[America]]n [[government]] to be of public and political import
ance and should that [[government]] signify a desire to obtain
possession of the whole or any part, the [[property]] so required
was to be transferred "at a proper valuation to be agreed upon
between the parties." The Hudson's [[Bay]] Company early be
gan to feel that this change in position was exercising a most
injurious effect upon its business and interests, "and that it
was regarded by the [[America]]n settlers and by the public au

thorities with no favorable eye." As soon almost as the [[treaty]]
was concluded, urgent representations were made to the Bri
tish [[government]], and through it to the [[America]]n [[government]],
charging the latter with failure to protect the [[company]] in the
enjoyment of its [[treaty]] rights. Recourse to the local courts of

justice, it was said, was not sufficient protection, due to a
popular prejudice against any foreign corporation which held
valuable properties within the territory.

For a score of years, before the date of the [[treaty]], the Ore
gon country had been in the virtual possession of the Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company, and, when the [[America]]n people awoke to the
realization that through this occupation [[Great]] [[Britain]] had ma
terially strengthened her claim, public opinion demanded the

immediate colonization of the Oregon country. Mass meet

ings were held and emigration societies were formed, and the
expedient of granting land to any [[America]]n settler who would
emigrate to Oregon appeared to meet with general approba
tion. During the decade prior to [[1850]], and before [[America]]n
title to the country was admitted, the practicability of grant
ing donation land claims to such [[America]]ns as had or would in
the future settle in Oregon was a much debated topic in con

gress. The senator from Missouri, Lewis Linn, periodically

raised the question, and, as often, bills providing for such do
nations were defeated, on the ground that they were not in
good taste. When [[America]]n title to the country was acknowl
edged by the [[treaty]] of [[1846]], it was felt generally that the chief

objection to the donation privilege had been removed and that
[[congress]] would treat the settlers handsomely by the adoption

of a liberal land policy. It was not entirely chance that the
largest emigration of the decade occurred in [[1847]]. In order

to force the hand of [[congress]], the provisional [[government]] in
Oregon had provided to each settler, over 18 years of age, a
donation claim of 640 acres. Not only did [[congress]] not con
firm these claims, but, in the act establishing the territorial
[[government]], all such grants were declared void and of no con
sequence. In [[1850]], however, the coveted donation claims were
provided by [[congress]]; at the same time, the office of surveyor
general of public lands in Oregon was created.
Upon the extension of the public surveys over Oregon, the

land office was faced with the difficult problem of determin
ing the limit and extent of the [[property]] and possessory rights

guaranteed to the [[British]] [[companies]] under the [[treaty]]. As con
gress had neither availed itself of the opportunity to purchase
those claims nor made any provision for ascertaining and de
taching from the public domain the particular lands compre
hended by the [[treaty]], it devolved upon the general land office
to assume the task. Consequently, the surveyor-general was
instructed to require the [[company]] to present evidence in sup
port of its claims, and, when this should be done to his satis
faction, he was to avoid making any sectional or other minute
subdivisions of the lands in question. When asked to define
the limits of their respective establishments, the [[company]]
agents, with one accord, pleaded lack of authority in the mat
ter and refused to make any authoritative definition of bound
aries. Meanwhile, the country was rapidly being settled, and,
as the [[company]] claimed much of the best land in the territory
(the [[Vancouver]] claim comprised over 160,000 acres alone), a
struggle between the settler and the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company
was inevitable. Already in [[1852]], there were so many Ameri
cans squatting on the [[company]]'s acreage at [[Vancouver]] that
Chief Factor Ballenden had thought it necessary to seek the

protection of the military. This conflict of claims-the set
tler seeking to appropriate and the [[company]] to retain the best
lands-raised many interesting questions, and, beyond a doubt,
the piecemeal appropriation of the [[company]]'s lands was an
important factor in the [[company]]'s determination to liquidate
its claims and withdraw from [[America]]n territory.

The fur [[trade]] was the [[company]]'s chief [[trade]], but, when
title to the country was vested in the [[America]]n people, the
heydey of the [[trade]] in furs was past. Farms and the fur [[trade]]
could not exist side by side, and the latter was destined to give
way. The advent of the settler not only foretold the whole
sale destruction of the fur-bearing animals, but it also occa
sioned a feeling of unrest and resentment among the [[Indian]]
tribes. This disaffection was manifest during the Cayuse In
dian war, [[1847]]-48, when the [[trade]] at Walla Walla was seri
ously curtailed and the reverberations were felt at posts as far

removed as Fort Hall, some 600 miles. The posts at Walla

Walla, Boise and Hall were finally abandoned, never to be re

occupied, in consequence of the Yakima [[Indian]] war, [[1855]],

but not before [[America]]n officialdom had struck a telling blow

at the [[company]]'s [[Indian]] [[trade]]. Anson Dart appeared in Ore
gon as superintendent of [[Indian]] affairs; in [[1850]], he was in
structed by Commissioner Lea, of the [[Indian]] office, to pro
hibit the [[company]]'s [[trade]] in his superintendency. In [[1853]],
the [[company]] was notified by [[Governor]] Stevens, of Washing
ton Territory, that after [[July]] 1, [[1864]], it would no longer be
permitted to [[trade]] with the [[Indian]]s in [[Washington]] Territory.
This order was enforced through the removal of most of the

tribes to reservations in [[1856]], "leaving the [[company]] no In
dians to [[trade]] with, except at their stations at Fort Colville,
the Kootenay and Flatheads." The matter of the [[company]]'s
[[Indian]] policy, with its masterful control over the tribes, pro
vides an interesting theme; especially when contrasted with
the inherent weaknesses of the [[America]]n policy, as revealed
during the period of the [[1840]]s and 18S0s.
In [[1849]], the customs district of Oregon was created, with
Astoria as the port of entry. Goods imported from England
were dutiable, and the [[company]] supplied all its posts, west of
the mountains, from [[Vancouver]]. By [[January]] 1, [[1850]], duties

aggregating $23,000 had been collected at Astoria; of this

amount, $6800 had been paid, under [[protest]], by the Hudson's
[[Bay]] Company. The result was a considerable increase in the
cost of the merchandise, with a relative decrease in the mar
gin of profit. In order to avoid the expense of entering, at
Astoria, goods destined for the posts north of the 49th parallel,

Fort Victoria, on [[Vancouver]] Island, was made the entrepot for
the northern posts.

In the early period of the [[trade]], the [[company]] employed a
large force of men to protect the fur brigades from the hostile

[[Indian]]s. During the inactive season, these men were employed
at dairying, lumbering and farming, thus providing the basis
for an extensive foreign commerce. Lumber, shingles, flour
and salt salmon were exported to the Hawaiian Islands at the
annual profit of $10,000. The [[trade]] in flour, wheat, butter,
pork and beef, with the [[Russia]]n-[[America]]n Fur Company at
Sitka, yielded an additional profit of from $8000 to $10,000 a

year. Shipments of lumber and spars were made to Chile.
There was a [[company]] post at Yerba Buena, on the site of the
present San Francisco; although this establishment was aban
doned in [[1846]], [[trade]] with [[California]] was resumed after the
[[gold]] rush. However, the piecemeal appropriation of the com
pany's acreage at [[Vancouver]], by settlers claiming under the
donation act, destroyed the industries on which the foreign
[[trade]] was based, and the [[trade]] was ruined.
The unobstructed use of the Columbia River system was
essential to the prosecution of a profitable [[trade]], and the [[treaty]]

of [[1846]] secured the free navigation of this river to the Hud

son's [[Bay]] Company. The portages at the Cascades and The

Dalles, the unrestricted use of which the [[company]] claimed as a
[[treaty]] right, were appropriated and improved by [[America]]n
business interests. Although a public highway was maintained
at each portage, the [[company]] complained that their rights were
so restricted as to be valueless.

In [[May]], [[1849]], Major Hatheway landed at Fort [[Vancouver]]
with a contingent of regulars and, upon the invitation of Chief
Factor Ogden, established a military post there. His successor,
Colonel Loring, declared a military reservation of four square
miles, "subject alone to the lawful claims of the Hudson's [[Bay]]
Company, as guaranteed under the [[treaty]] between the [[United]]

[[States]] and [[Great]] [[Britain]];" the [[company]] post was included

within the limits of the reserve. [[America]]n settlers, greedy of
the [[company]]'s numberless acres, had early questioned the ex
tent of the [[company]]'s possessory rights, and had determined to
their own satisfaction that these rights did not extend beyond
the actual enclosures. The authorities of Clarke County, hav
ing decided to locate the county seat at [[Vancouver]], plotted a

town on the [[company]] claim, and actually disposed of lots

which included buildings occupied by [[company]] employes. The

purchasers were restrained from actual occupancy only be
cause the [[property]] fell within the limits of the military re
serve. A petition to the war department, drawn up by the

disaffected citizenry, did not fall on deaf ears, and, in [[August]],

[[1851]], the war department instructed the general commanding
the [[Pacific]] division to reduce the [[Vancouver]] reserve to 160
acres excluding, as far as possible, all improvements belonging

to private parties. Given interests as powerful and as diverse
as those which motivated the [[company]] and the military at
[[Vancouver]], it was inevitable that there should be a conflict of
interests. In order to obtain coveted sites, the military occa
sionally found it necessary to remove or destroy abandoned
sheds and buildings belonging to the [[company]]. In [[1850]], the
[[company]] challenged the right of the military to dispose sum
marily of [[company]] [[property]], thus instituting a controversy
that was to end only with the withdrawal of the [[company]]
from [[Vancouver]]. The adverse claims advanced by the Catho
lic mission of Saint James, by the [[America]]n settlers, and by
the county of Clarke to the acreage embraced in the com
pany's [[Vancouver]] claim also provide an attractive theme.
The [[company]] early hit upon the obvious solution of selling
its [[America]]n properties and withdrawing from the territory;
in this way it hoped to liquidate its claims before too substan
tial a part of its [[property]] had been appropriated. As early as

[[November]], [[1847]], the [[company]] entered into an agreement

with George N. Sanders whereby the latter was empowered to

act as an agent in the matter of the proposed sale. Accord
ing to the terms, the [[company]] asked only $410,000 for its
claims against the [[America]]n [[government]]; in the event that

Sanders should be able to dispose of the [[property]], it was agreed
that he was to receive two and one-half percent of the sale
price, plus any sum in excess of the amount asked. A decade
later, when the [[British]] [[government]] was supporting the com
pany's claim that its [[America]]n [[property]] was worth $1,000,
000, the Sanders contract was disclosed and the [[company]] was
considerably embarrassed. In a correspondence relative to the
matter of sale, Sanders informed Secretary of State Buchanan
that the [[company]] had fixed but one price, and that price was

$1,000,000; Sanders was playing for high stakes. In [[April]],
[[1848]], [[Governor]] Pelly, of the [[company]], informed Lord Pal
merston, at the foreign office, that the [[company]] was ready and

willing to dispose of its possessory rights to the [[America]]n gov
ernment, and he authorized Palmerston to open negotiations on
the matter. Palmerston informed Pelly that the navigation
right, though listed among the [[company]]'s possessory rights,
could not be sold by the [[company]]. In [[June]], the [[British]] min

ister at [[Washington]] was instructed to inform the [[America]]n
[[government]] of the [[company]]'s offer. Crampton's resultant
conversation with Secretary Buchanan introduced a corre
spondence on the matter, between the two [[government]]s, which
was to be terminated only with the settlement of the question.

During the course of the conversation, Buchanan stated that
he favored purchasing the claims, especially the navigation
right. He expressed an opinion that the question might best
be settled by [[treaty]] or convention, as [[congress]] would vote the
necessary appropriation as a matter of course in that case;
whereas, any other means would necessitate a grant of money
by the house of [[representative]]s, at best a procedure uncertain.
The [[America]]n [[government]] insisted that the navigation right
must be extinguished upon the purchase of the [[company]]'s
possessory rights. Despite the opinions of eminent jurists, in
[[British]] [[North]] [[America]] as well as in the [[United]] [[States]], wherein
all agreed that the navigation right would be extinguished

with the other claims, Palmerston was unyielding. Conse

quently, Buchanan took no definite action in the matter of
purchase, although the [[company]] had offered to close out at

$1,000,000.

In the Oregon country, conflicts between the [[company]]'s
agents and [[America]]n settlers and public officials were both
frequent and threatening. The [[company]] complained to the
[[British]] [[government]] that squatters were appropriating the best
lands it possessed. Upon being requested to investigate the
matter, Secretary of State Clayton replied that the proposed
territorial [[government]] would put a stop to such acts of ag
gression. Nor were the [[British]] alone in making accusations.
The delegate from Oregon, S. R. Thurston, charged -the com
pany with pursuing a policy whereby the [[Indian]]s in the terri
tory became prejudiced against the [[America]]n [[government]] and
people. An actual conflict seemed imminent in [[1850]], when
two [[company]] vessels, the Cadboro and the Prince of Wales,
were seized by customs officials for alleged violations of the

revenue laws. At this time, the [[company]] was so eager to

withdraw from [[America]]n territory that [[Governor]] Pelly sug
gested that a joint commission be named for the purpose of
deter[[mining]] the purchase price. In [[1851]], many more com

plaints were received at the foreign office. After requiring
that the [[company]] state the extent of its claims, the [[British]]
minister at [[Washington]] was instructed to inform the Ameri
can [[government]] that his [[government]] was anxious to see an
equitable and speedy settlement reached; "that the sooner the
[[company]]'s possessory rights pass by sale to the [[United]] [[States]],
the better for all parties concerned." Meanwhile, two more
[[company]] vessels, the steamer Beaver and the brigantine Mary
Dare, had been seized by customs officials. The [[British]] gov
ernment secured the release of the vessels, and a commission,
appointed to investigate the seizure, made an award of dam
ages to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company.

At last, in [[1852]], it seemed that the claims question would be
settled by [[treaty]]; that the navigation right clause, the main
source of misunderstanding in the earlier negotiations, would
cause no more trouble. Crampton and Webster were agreed
that, upon the purchase of the [[company]]'s rights, the naviga
tion right would cease for all practical purposes. A convention
effecting the purchase was drawn up, and a draft was submit
ted to the foreign office. The [[America]]n [[government]] was to
pay $1,000,000 in settlement of the claims. The [[British]] gov
ernment, however, rejected the convention because article III
renounced the navigation right. Concerning this article, the
foreign secretary wrote to Crampton: "I have to say that Her
Majesty's Government feel that they cannot with propriety
assent to such an article because by so doing they would have
the appearance of making a cession without an equivalent. It
is true that the cession would be merely in appearance; but
appearance ought, for fear of misconstruction, to be avoided."
Then almost overnight the [[British]] [[government]] reversed itself
and instructed Crampton to press for a settlement of the
claims question. The change in policy was due to information,
sent by Eden Colvile of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company, to the
effect that the Fraser River constituted a superior route of
communication into the northwest, and that there was no
longer need to retain the route of the Columbia. But mean
while, on [[October]] 24, [[1852]], Daniel Webster had departed this
life, and his successor in the state department, Edward Everett,

was unacquainted with the question. When Crampton ap

proached Secretary Everett on the matter, in [[December]], [[1852]],
he was informed that the [[America]]n [[government]] was awaiting
information concerning the extent and value of the [[company]]'s

possessions. This information was not received at the state
department until a year later; [[Governor]] Stevens, of Washing
ton Territory, who drew up the report, valued the [[company]]'s
claims at $300,000. He recognized, however, only such rights
as were based upon actual occupation.
In the year [[1855]], the [[company]]'s claims could have been pur
chased for the sum of $300,000. The house had passed a bill
appropriating that sum, and, when the senate refused to make
the appropriation, it was charged that the driving of a shrewd
bargain had been placed before the peace of a nation. When
the [[British]] [[government]] proposed arbitration, the offer was re

fused by the [[America]]n [[government]]. When it was proposed
to refer the question for settlement to the boundary commis
sioners, Mr. Campbell and Captain Prevost, the [[America]]n gov
ernment again refused, though with less reason this time, for
the commissioners were already in the northwest, they knew
land values there, and they were able enough to serve in this
added capacity. In [[May]], [[1857]], the [[America]]n [[government]] ap
peared to be ready to settle for the sum of $300,000. By this
time, however, the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company had raised its price
to $1,000,000; only to reduce it within a few months to the
sum of $650,000. At the advice of the [[British]] [[government]],
the price was further reduced to $500,000; but there was no
purchaser. In [[1858]], the [[America]]n [[government]] began to press
for a settlement of the question. After Secretary of State Cass
was assured that the foreign office had power of attorney to
act in the matter, he announced that the [[America]]n govern
ment was ready to receive any formal plan for settlement. In
reply, the foreign office submitted, for the approval of the
[[America]]n [[government]], a [[treaty]] to provide a joint commission
for the purpose of settling the claims dispute. An objection
was made to article V, and the [[British]] [[government]] offered to
substitute an amended article. At this point, the negotiations
were interrupted by the outbreak of the Civil war. Negoti
ations, resumed in the spring of [[1863]], resulted in the signing

of the [[treaty]] of [[July]] 1, [[1863]], which provided for a joint com
mission to settle the question.
Sir John Rose was appointed commissioner on the part of
[[Great]] [[Britain]], and Alexander S. Johnston was named on the

part of the [[United]] [[States]]. The commissioners met in Wash

ington in [[January]], [[1865]], where they subscribed the requisite
declarations, chose clerks, received authorities from respective
counsel, and adopted procedural rules and regulations. There
was some delay in the selection of the umpire. The Hudson's

[[Bay]] Company refused to accept the [[King]] of [[Italy]] in this
role, while the [[America]]n [[government]] would accept no other

person save an [[America]]n. On [[April]] 21, the commissioners

jointly issued a commission to Judge B. R. Curtis, who sub
scribed the solemn declaration three days later. In [[November]],
[[1868]], the Hudson's [[Bay]] Company complained that almost four
years had elapsed since the commissioners had held their first
meeting, and nothing definite had yet been achieved. It was
explained, by the [[British]] commissioner, that the delay was due
to the rule which required the commissioners to sit as a judicial

body to review the evidence. The evidence had taken con

siderable time to gather; in the case of the Hudson's [[Bay]] Com
pany, it had filled four printed volumes of 1470 pages. The
Puget Sound Agricultural Company presented its evidence in
three volumes of 550 pages. Other documents and the printed
arguments filled 1250 pages more. The [[company]] had not closed
its case until [[August]], [[1868]], while the [[United]] [[States]] had filed
its answer only in [[November]].
On [[September]] 10, [[1869]], the commissioners pronounced the
award; they were able to reach a compromise decision without
referring the case to the umpire. By the terms of the award,
the sum of $450,000 was awarded to the Hudson's [[Bay]] Com
pany, and the sum of $200,000 to the Puget Sound Agricul
tural Company. The award was paid in two equal installments.
