Inter-[[America]]n Commission on Human Rights in [[Washington]], DC - fall [[2019]]).
 
 
For decades, the families of [[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Indigenous]] women and girls and
their communities; together with [[Indigenous]] women leaders and experts and allied
human rights organizations, advocated for [[government]] action to end the crisis. 
Many families had called for a national inquiry, which was supported by various 
international human rights [[treaty]] bodies. After a tumultuous start and numerous 
set-backs, the National Inquiry concluded its work and released its final report
at a ceremony on [[June]] 3, [[2019]], before hundreds of [[Indigenous]] family members, 
leaders and advocates. They found [[Canada]] guilty of both historic and ongoing 
genocide.
 
 
Throughout the National Inquiry’s proceedings, Minister of [[Indigenous]] Affairs 
Carolyn Bennett committed that [[Canada]] would not sit idly by while the inquiry 
proceeded. They committed to take action to end the [[violence]], which was well 
documented in numerous reports. Yet, they failed to act. Since the release of 
the final report, very little, if any substantive action has been taken by PM 
[[[[Trudeau]]]]’s Liberal [[government]] to end genocide against [[Indigenous]] women and girls 
in [[Canada]]. 
 
 
The abuse, exploitation, [[violence]], disappearances and murders of [[Indigenous]] 
women and girls continues unabated and represents the largest human rights 
crisis ever facing [[Canada]]. The National Inquiry confronted this reality head on 
when it concluded that [[Canada]] is guilty of genocide that is both race-based and 
one that has specifically targeted [[Indigenous]] women. They found that:
 
 
While the [[Canadian]] genocide targets all [[Indigenous]] peoples, [[Indigenous]] women, 
girls and 2S[[LGBT]]QQIA people are particularly targeted.
 
 
This finding was based on an independent legal analysis and the extensive 
evidence gathered during the inquiry. They further explained:
 
 
[[Canada]]’s colonial [[history]] provides ample evidence of the existence of a 
genocidal policy – a manifest pattern of similar conduct which reflects an 
intention to destroy [[Indigenous]] peoples.
 
 
What resulted from this finding was a media blitz of commentators engaging in 
debates as to whether the inquiry went too far; whether they were using the word
to strategically to get attention; or whether anything other than the Holocaust 
could ever amount to genocide. Very few of those commentators had specifically 
worked in, were educated in, or conducted [[research]] on genocide; nor were most of
them lawyers. Yet, these emotional or political reactions to the finding is what
led the discussion versus the very pressing need for [[government]]s to take urgent 
action. 
 
 
Even the [[United]] Nations High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet expressed great 
concern and called on [[Canada]] to examine this finding. Similarly, Luis Almagro 
who heads the Organization of [[America]]n [[States]], expressed his concern that [[Canada]]
was too slow to act on the national inquiry’s findings. Meanwhile, some 
commentators reacted by saying that the inquiry’s finding should be 
investigated. There is no utility in reinvestigating this finding. It is a legal
finding based on fact and law. What was needed then and what is needed now is 
action to end the genocide.
 
 
None of this should come as a shock to [[government]] officials, [[Indigenous]] leaders,
scholars and activists have long been calling [[Canada]]’s historic and ongoing 
[[treatment]] of [[Indigenous]] peoples genocide. Some have also highlighted the fact 
that sexualized genocide towards [[Indigenous]] women and girls has been an integral
part of [[Canada]]’s violent colonization of [[Indigenous]] lands. While not a specific 
focus of Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) investigation into 
residential schools, their final report also concluded that [[Canada]]’s actions 
towards [[Indigenous]] peoples amounted to cultural, physical and [[biological]] 
genocide: “part of a coherent policy to eliminate [[Aboriginal]] people as distinct 
peoples and to assimilate them into the [[Canadian]] mainstream against their will.”
 
 
The crime of genocide is a crime under international law that developed over 
time – even before the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the 
Crime of Genocide adopted in [[1948]]. A state need only be guilty of one of the 
five ways to commit genocide against a racial group like [[Indigenous]] peoples, 
which include: 
 
 
(1) [[kill]]ing; 
 
(2) physical/[[mental]] harm; 
 
(3) conditions of life to bring about destruction; 
 
(4) preventing births; and 
 
(5) the forced transfer of [[child]]ren. 
 
 
[[Canada]] is guilty of all five.
 
 
The National inquiry, without excluding the possibility that individuals could 
be held liable for genocide in [[Canada]], and duly noting that acts and omissions 
of provinces within [[Canada]], draws a conclusion on the responsibility of [[Canada]] 
as a state for genocide under international law.
 
 
The inquiry also found that pre- and post-colonial settler [[government]]s have 
created, maintained and reinforced an infrastructure of [[violence]] towards 
[[Indigenous]] women and girls. This infrastructure of [[violence]] is a complex set of 
institutional laws, policies, practices, actions and omissions that treat 
[[Indigenous]] women as lesser human beings, who are sexualized, racialized and 
treated as disposable because of their sex and their race. This infrastructure 
remains firmly in place today manifesting in high rates of [[violence]] towards 
[[Indigenous]] women and girls.
 
 
This genocide has been empowered by colonial structures, evidenced notably by 
the [[Indian]] Act, the Sixties scoop, residential schools and breaches of human and
[[Indigenous]] rights, leading directly to the current increased rates of [[violence]] 
[[death]] and suicide in [[Indigenous]] populations.
 
 
The National Inquiry considered the following as examples of genocide:
 
 
- Deaths of [[Indigenous]] women and girls in police custody;
 
- Failure to protect them from exploitation and trafficking;
 
- Failure to protect them from known [[kill]]ers;
 
- Taking their [[child]]ren and placing in [[foster]] care at high rates;
 
- Physical, [[mental]] and sexual abuse in state institutions (residential schools, 
hospitals, [[prison]]s, etc);
 
- Denial of [[Indian]] status and band membership;
 
- Forced and/or coerced sterilizations; and
 
- Purposeful chronic underfunding of essential human services like food, water, 
[[health]], housing.
 
 
These modern day examples discussed in the inquiry’s report would be in addition
to earlier pre-meditated [[kill]]ings:
 
 
- small pox blankets, 
 
- scalping bounties, 
 
-mass murders of some native groups, like the Beothuk; and
 
- starvation policies and ethnic cleansing on the prairies.
 
 
When considering the testimonies of thousands of families, [[Indigenous]] women 
leaders, and advocates, as well as subject-matter experts, together with 
extensive legal, historical and social [[[[science]]]] [[research]]; the inquiry could come 
to no other conclusion but genocide.
 
 
[[Canada]] has displayed a continuous policy with shifting expressed motives but an 
ultimately steady intention, to destroy [[Indigenous]] peoples physically 
[[biological]]ly and as social units.
 
 
All [[government]]s and state agencies are still active perpetrators and 
perpetuators of genocidal [[violence]] against [[Indigenous]] women and girls in [[Canada]].
Ending the genocide which is embedded in state institutions and society as a 
whole, will require immediate and urgent remedies that match the scope and 
character of these grave human rights violations – i.e. a comprehensive national
action plan that is well-resourced and focusing on transitioning [[Canada]] out of 
genocide. That is no small feat. This will require external oversight but 
international human rights bodies or experts, with [[Indigenous]] women as core 
decision-makers.
 
 
Organizations like the Inter-[[America]]n Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) have 
access to experts in genocide – experts who have worked with other countries to 
transition out of genocide. It makes no sense to ask the perpetrator of genocide
to be the one to design the plan and implement the plan to get out of genocide. 
[[Indigenous]] women and human rights experts must be the ones to lead this process,
together with international genocide experts to design this plan. [[Canadian]] 
officials must then work directly with [[Indigenous]] women and their [[Indigenous]] 
[[government]]s to oversee a fully- resourced transitional justice plan that is 
national in scope, applies to all levels of [[government]] and related agencies, and
focuses on: 
 
 
(1) ending ongoing genocide;
 
(2) [[reparations]] for harms done; and 
 
(3) the prevention of future genocide. 
 
 
This will require an [[Indigenous]] and human rights framework and gender-based 
analysis for all stages of the plan. While [[Canada]] promised the [[United]] Nations 
that it would come up with a national action plan by [[June]] [[2020]], few expect more 
than their standard action plan framework that tends to be overly general with 
no measurable outcomes. This is why several [[Indigenous]] women and human rights 
advocates attended the IACHR in the fall of [[2019]] to ask for international 
intervention and oversight. [[Canada]]’s response at the time was that they were too
busy with the election. Then, they were too busy with holidays. [[June]] is several 
weeks away and in all likelihood, [[Indigenous]] women and girls will be left behind
again. 
 
 
Genocide is the worst crime and human rights violation that can be committed 
against a people. But you wouldn’t know it by looking at [[Canada]]’s lack of action
on the crisis. Pipelines get more money and attention than [[Indigenous]] women and 
girls.
 
 
 
It’s truly time for more international intervention before thousands more lives 
are lost.

plan to take into account that [[Indigenous]] women and girls face not only the 
[[pandemic]], but also ongoing genocide:
