Introduction
The [[assassination]] of [[President]] John F. [[Kennedy]] in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, Texas at 12:30PM CST
on [[November]] 22nd, [[1963]] stands as a pivotal moment in the consciousness of the [[America]]n
people, especially the most idealistic generation: the Baby Boomers. Since that tragic day, there
have been multiple [[government]] investigations, reports, and review boards, and over 600 books
published on the [[Kennedy]] [[assassination]]. The result: an entire spectrum of theories as to what
happened that day and who, exactly, was responsible for that terrible event. Cowell 103 will
explore, within context, the ten principal theories, and their political, social and legal
implications for [[America]].

Expectations
The purpose of this course is NOT to “advocate” any particular theory but, instead, to familiarize
a new generation of [[America]]ns with the specifics of each such major theory and to allow each
student to evaluate the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each. Each student will
subsequently come to his or her own conclusion as to what they believe happened.
Each student is expected to show up to every lecture, attendance will be taken. Weekly readings
must be completed before your section, and students must be ready for group discussion. Each
student will write two, 2-3 page summaries, and one Final Paper (10-12 pages). Extra-credit will
be assigned to final papers that display exemplary quality, increased length, and thorough
[[research]]; talk with TA’s for more information.

Grading
Attendance (Lecture and Section) - 15%
Participation (Lecture and Section) - 15%
(2) 3 page summaries- 20% (10% each)
Rough Draft of Final Paper - 10%
Final Paper - 40%

Section
Each student is mandated to come to the Thursday evening section, after the lecture, from 67:10pm. There are 9 scheduled sections, and failure to attend will result in a substantial reduction
in the student's participation grade.
