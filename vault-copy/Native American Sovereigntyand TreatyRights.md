NATIVE AMERICAN SOVEREIGNTY AND TREATY
RIGHTS: ARE THEY HISTORICAL ILLUSIONS?
Robert A. Fairbanks*

Introduction
[[Native]] [[America]]n peoples, and their [[government]]s, steadfastly claim they
possess "[[sovereignty]]." Moreover, they vociferously demand that local, state

and federal [[government]]s honor and respect their [[sovereignty]]. However,
given the conservative political [[climate]] that has swept the [[United]] [[States]],
[[Native]] [[America]]n peoples can expect strong challenges to the [[sovereignty]] of
their [[government]]s. These challenges will be resilient and imaginative. They

will take many forms and come from expected and unexpected sources. In
turn, [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples, and their [[government]]s, must be prepared to

repel these attacks. Otherwise, they can expect continued erosion of their
[[sovereignty]] and pendent [[treaty]] rights.

Sovereign Capacity
A claim of [[sovereignty]] implies ability and willingness to exercise the
supreme powers of [[government]]. Therefore, assuming a sufficient population

and adequate land base, the inquiry becomes whether [[Native]] [[America]]n
[[government]]s possess the institutional capacity to exercise jurisdiction over
the population resident on reservation territory.1

Inspection reveals that [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s, in fact, are able
to exercise very little sovereign power over people ? native and non-native
alike ? residing within, or merely passing through, reservation boundaries.

According to federal law, a tribal [[government]] cannot prosecute a non
reservation member for a crime committed within the boundaries of its

reservation no matter how heinous or trivial.2 Moreover, a tribal
[[government]] cannot even prosecute a reservation member for murder, rape,
robbery or any other felony.3 The revealing truth is that tribal [[government]]s

142 AMERICAN INDIAN LA W REVIEW [Vol. 20
are incapable of exercising the police power of [[government]] within the
boundaries of their reservations, except in minor, almost insignificant ways.
It is inescapable, therefore, that most [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s have
no police power over the majority of people within the boundaries of their

reservations. For example, Leech Lake Reservation in north central
Minnesota is populated by nearly 10,000 individuals; only about 3700 of the
reservation residents are members of the Leech Lake Band of [[Ojibwe]].4
Most reservations across the country are similarly situated.
Similarly, it is doubtful that tribal [[government]]s can effectively regulate

land use within their reservation boundaries. There is little question that
tribal [[government]] can enact zoning regulations for land held by reservation

members on the reservation. However, on many, if not most, reservations
the vast majority of land is owned by non-reservation members. Again
using Leech Lake Reservation as an example, only about 30,000 of over
677,000 acres is owned by a reservation member or the tribal [[government]].5
Therefore, tribal [[government]]'s ability to regulate use of reservation land is,

indeed, negligible.
Foregoing consideration of other indicia of sovereign power for now,6
it becomes apparent [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s exercise little in the way

of legitimate sovereign power. Moreover, mere casual inquiry reveals that
by and large the [[government]]al powers actually exercised by contemporary
tribal [[government]]s are those gratuitously granted by the federal [[government]].

Those powers are found in the [[Indian]] Reorganization Act of [[1934]],7 an act
of the [[United]] [[States]] [[Congress]]. Besides being severely limited in scope,
those powers can be amended, or eliminated for that matter, at the whim of

[[Congress]]. Thus the sovereign powers exercised by contemporary tribal
[[government]]s are more illusion than real.

Even more significantly, the Self-Determination and Educational
Assistance Act8 is also illusory. In substance, self-determination under the
Act means no more than permission to administer housing, education,
[[health]], and community development and other programs of the Bureau of
[[Indian]] Affairs and the Public Health Service. Moreover, administration of
those programs must conform to the rules, regulations and guidelines of the

federal [[government]]. Furthermore, reservation casinos ? the alleged
economic salvation of the [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples ? are subject to

extensive federal regulation and reluctant state acquiescence.9 Given federal

plenary power,10 [[Native]] [[America]]n self-determination and [[sovereignty]] are
illusory.

Federal plenary power notwithstanding, the rancorous chorus of
"inherent" [[sovereignty]] is often heard. Does tribal [[government]] have any
political capacity independent of the federal [[government]]? Much insight into

this question can be gained by exa[[mining]] the political maturity of [[Native]]
[[America]]n [[government]]s.
By analogy, [[government]]s are just like people. The [[sovereignty]] powers
of [[government]]s can be compared to citizenship rights of individuals. For
instance, when a [[child]] is first brought into this world, it is totally dependent
upon its parents for survival. If the parents do not feed, clothe and shelter

the [[child]], it will soon die. But, if the [[child]] is appropriately nurtured, it will

grow physically, emotionally and intellectually, and it may eventually
acquire the worldly s[[kill]]s necessary to survive in the community in which
it finds itself.

In this final develop[[mental]] stage, an individual adult will acquire some
degree of capacity to engage in the spectrum of human endeavor; in varying

degrees some will be dependent upon [[government]] for food, shelter and
clothing and others will be fully independent. Similarly, [[Native]] [[America]]n
peoples, and their [[government]]s, need to determine where on the scale of
political maturity they find themselves. Many, if not most, will find
themselves dependent upon the [[Great]] White Father in [[Washington]], D.C.
Political Maturity and Meeting the Challenge
The only scrap of [[sovereignty]] [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples can claim with
certitude emanates from the authority of the [[United]] [[States]] [[Congress]] which

passed the [[Indian]] Reorganization Act of [[1932]].11 This act permitted [[Native]]
[[America]]n peoples to form "reservation business committees" to conduct
their limited affairs with the local, state and federal [[government]]s. Although
now often called "Reservation Tribal Councils," the form and power of the
business committee has changed little since [[1932]] and the exercise of such
power, in large measure, remains subject to approval by Bureau of [[Indian]]
Affairs officials.

The salient point here is that the business committees can be eliminated
by [[Congress]] very simply. And given the misconduct of many elected tribal

officials and the general ineffectiveness of tribal [[government]],12 coupled

144 AMERICAN INDIAN LAW REVIEW [Vol. 20
with the political conservatives' desire to slash the cost of federal
[[government]] and their perception that huge casino profits abound, the vestige
of [[sovereignty]] exercised by [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples is endangered, indeed.

For the most part, tribal [[government]]s appear ill-prepared to rebut
challenges to their [[sovereignty]]. For example, tribal [[government]]s have
generally proven incapable of dealing with self-serving and corrupt elected

tribal officials. This critical institutional weakness alone may hasten the
demise of tribal [[sovereignty]]. Similarly, former Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal

Chairman Frank Ducheneaux has observed that "today tribal leaders pay
little attention to the Constitution and by-laws governing them and they
have no knowledge of the [[history]] of their tribe, [[treaties]] and acts of
[[Congress]]."13 There are exceptions, of course, but generally tribal leaders,
for reasons including little formal education, lack political sophistication and
are ill-prepared to deal effectively with local, state and federal [[government]]

officials.

To secure and protect the residual [[treaty]] rights of native peoples, [[Native]]
[[America]]n [[government]]s must begin a swift march toward political maturity

and economic independence. To do otherwise will insure the demise of
distinct [[Native]] [[America]]n "body politics" and amount to complicity in the
historical federal policy of termination.

Acknowledging much federal [[Indian]] law rests on questionable political

logic, Notre Dame Professor Sharon O'Brien instructs that "[t]ribal
[[government]]s and individuals must not simply accept the federal
[[government]]'s interpretation of their rights and status. Laws, regulations, and
court decisions that limit tribal [[sovereignty]] must be questioned and carefully

challenged."14 In other words, if [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s are truly
"inherently" sovereign, they will, and must, assert their rights of citizenship
in the community of sovereign [[government]]s.

However, tribal [[government]]s must be able and willing to accept the

responsibility of governing. Questions abound about whether tribal
[[government]]s, given their often dictatorial, nonseparation of powers structure

and the ill-preparedness of many elected tribal officials, are capable of
assuming such responsibility. Furthermore, [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples must
ask themselves, given the historic and contemporary performance of their

[[government]]s, whether they want their [[government]]s to assume such
responsibility. This inquiry may not be particularly encouraging.

Pemberton, Secretary-Treasurer Myron Ellis and reservation attorney Harold Finn were convicted

of multiple felony counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and theft of reservation funds, and

Treasurer Jerry Rawley and Representative Rich Clark were similarly convicted.

No. 1] SOVEREIGNTY & TREATY RIGHTS 145
The litmus test of [[Native]] [[America]]n tribal [[sovereignty]] is whether [[Native]]

[[America]]n [[government]]s would whither and die if all non-[[treaty]]-mandated
federal monies were withdrawn in response to sustained assertions of
[[sovereignty]]? The answer would reveal the magnitude of any disparity

between persistent claims of [[sovereignty]] and the ability to perform
sovereign responsibilities.

Loss of [[Native]] Languages and Sovereignty
As if the foregoing challenges are not daunting enough, there is another,

more funda[[mental]], matter that must be addressed if [[Native]] [[America]]n
[[sovereignty]] is to survive in any reasonable, recognizable form. While it
may not be readily apparent to the casual observer, the loss of native
languages is by far the greatest threat to [[Native]] [[America]]n [[sovereignty]].

Federal policy makers have known the political significance of [[Native]]
[[America]]n languages for ages and, consequently, made eradication of native
languages a priority in the boarding schools of yesteryear. As a result, a
scant few individuals under the age of thirty can speak the native tongue of
their ancestors today. Furthermore, [[history]] teaches that when a language is
no longer heard, cultural distinctiveness soon fades from view.

Perhaps Captain Richard Henry Pratt, who founded Carlisle [[Indian]]
School, the first boarding school for [[Indian]]s, expressed the [[government]]'s
assimilation policy best when he said, "In [[Indian]] civilization I am a Baptist,

because I believe in immersing the [[Indian]]s in our civilization and when we
get them under holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked"15 The

[[Indian]]'s baptism was swift and the [[Western]] civilization catechism was
earnestly taught. Today, conversion from ancient traditional teachings is
nearly complete, and [[Native]] [[America]]n [[sovereignty]] is rapidly becoming a
historical matter.
Other than cultural nostalgia, native languages are important because they

provide cultural distinctiveness and identification of a "people." As [[Ojibwe]]
writer and artist Larry Cloud-Morgan has said, "The language is the people;

the language is the people!"16 In other words, for a "people" to exist they
must be distinguishable in some significant way. And, the important point
here is that there is no "[[sovereignty]]" if there is no "people."

Before [[Native]] [[America]]n people can claim any measure of [[sovereignty]]
according to international law, they must exist as a distinct people that
occupy certain territory and they must have a [[government]] that is capable of

exercising jurisdiction over both the territory and the people and the

capacity to relate to other sovereign entities.17 It is evident, in a strict
sense, that [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples' claim to international [[sovereignty]] is,
indeed, tenuous. Few would argue that [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s are
capable of, for example, maintaining international intercourse in the
community of nations or capable of training and equipping an effective
military defense establishment.
Nonetheless, the "inherent" [[sovereignty]] refrain is heard time and again
on every reservation across the country. The measure of this "inherent"
[[government]]al power must begin with the identification of a culturally
distinct people and as native languages relentlessly march toward [[death]] such
identification becomes increasingly problematic. Simply put, if there is not

a living language, there is no distinctive people; there is no inherent
[[sovereignty]].

What are [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples to do? Assuming the cries of

"inherent" [[sovereignty]] are earnest, then [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples must make
the revitalization of their languages and the reinvigoration of their cultural

distinctiveness their highest priorities. Moreover, they must take
responsibility for language revival into their own hands. Waiting for the
federal [[government]] or eleemosynary foundations to provide the resources
will only hasten extinguishment of [[Native]] [[America]]n [[sovereignty]].
The urgency of this matter cannot be overstated. "At the present rate of

decline, it is doubtful the [[Ojibwe]] language will survive another
generation,"18 [[Canadian]] [[Ojibwe]] scholar Cecil [[King]] recently stated. If [[King]]
is correct, the [[Ojibwe]] proclamation of [[sovereignty]] may well fall on deaf
ears. [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples should examine their language situation
carefully and act accordingly; their very existence as a distinct, sovereign

people depends on it. Otherwise, their descendants will have to read [[history]]

books to learn about the "[[Great]] [[Indian]] Nations."

Erosion of Pendent [[Treaty]] Rights
Of the many major issues facing [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples today, none
is more volatile and divisive than the question of "[[treaty]] rights." Many
[[America]]ns, inspired by the contemporary conservative political [[climate]],
vociferously [[protest]] the exercise of [[treaty]] rights by [[Native]] [[America]]ns. Even
so, [[Native]] [[America]]ns have achieved some success in protecting their [[treaty]]

rights. Nonetheless, there has been, and there will continue to be,
significant erosion of [[Native]] [[America]]n [[treaty]] rights. Why is this so?
The various [[Native]] [[America]]n nations negotiated and executed over three
hundred [[treaties]] with the [[United]] [[States]] of [[America]] before [[Congress]] declared

in [[March]] [[1871]] that "no [[Indian]] nation or tribe within the territory of the [[United]]
[[States]] shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or
power with whom the [[United]] [[States]] may contract by [[treaty]] . . . ,"19 Since the
Constitution requires Senate "advise and consent" to [[treaties]] negotiated by the
executive branch of [[government]], the [[congress]]ional enactment amounted to

notice to [[Native]] [[America]]ns that no additional "[[Indian]]" [[treaties]] would be
ratified and they would no longer have equal contracting status under federal

domestic law. [[President]]ial approval of this [[congress]]ional action indicated
agreement with this theretofore unprecedented federal policy. Clearly,
[[Congress]] had concluded that the various [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples no longer
deserved, or required, the recognition or respect of a sovereign personality.
Prior to this enactment, all [[Native]] [[America]]n [[treaties]] were considered and
approved in accordance with constitutional provisions. This irrefutable fact,

coupled with the [[1871]] Act, was explicit recognition that [[Native]] [[America]]n
[[treaties]] negotiated prior to [[March]] [[1871]], were of the same international
character as [[treaties]] between the [[United]] [[States]] and other foreign nation
states and, importantly, acquired the municipal status as the supreme law of

the land. In recognition of this obligation, [[Congress]] ratified the legal
viability of the outstanding [[treaties]] by providing that "no obligation of any
[[treaty]] lawfully made and ratified with any . . . [[Indian]] nation or tribe prior

to [[March]] 3, [[1871]], shall be . . . invalidated or impaired."20 However, due
to the expansionist forces of Manifest Destiny and ostensible capitalistic
greed, the efficacy of the [[Native]] [[America]]n [[treaties]] was soon called into
question; they have not enjoyed the same, or equal, [[treatment]] as other
[[treaties]].21

This disparate situation has been a source of considerable disagreement
and friction between the [[United]] [[States]], the various [[States]] and the various

[[Native]] [[America]]n peoples and has raised the inevitable question of the
practical (vice legal) efficacy of the [[treaties]]. [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples
maintain that their [[treaties]] ought to be honored as solemn contracts between

nations. The various [[States]], seemingly at the behest of special interest
groups, consistently refuse or neglect to honor [[treaty]] provisions.
In order to address this disparity, the contemporary force and effect of

[[Indian]] [[treaties]] must be decided. Thus, it is necessary to determine what
measure of [[sovereignty]] power is retained, if any, by the various [[Native]]
[[America]]n [[government]]s. Although many observe that [[Native]] [[America]]n
[[government]]s appear incapable of independent existence and, therefore, any
[[treaty]] rights they may have held are extinguished, individual [[Indian]] nations

148 AMERICAN INDIAN LA W REVIEW [Vol. 20
still regard themselves as independent, sovereign nations "inherently"
capable of political and economic intercourse with the [[United]] [[States]] and the

various [[States]]. Their position is supported by the decision of the [[United]]
[[States]] Supreme Court in [[United]] [[States]] v. Winans22 decided shortly after
the turn of the century. The Winans court determined that the [[Indian]] [[treaty]]
under consideration "was not a grant of rights to the [[Indian]]s, but a grant of

rights from them ? a reservation of those (rights) not granted."23 This
case confirms the principle that [[Indian]] nations keep, or reserve, certain
rights and powers not granted by [[treaty]] to the [[United]] [[States]] and that some

measure of [[sovereignty]] is retained.
Given the [[1871]] [[congress]]ional ratification and the subsequent recognition
by the Winans Court, why do the various [[States]] so uniformly fail to honor

[[treaty]] provisions at nearly every opportunity? Perhaps it is because the

Supreme Court has declared [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s as being
"domestic dependent nations."24 Or, as [[Native]] [[America]]n scholar Vine
Deloria, Jr., has argued, that the various [[Indian]] nations ought to seek the
status of an international protectorate under the tutelage of the [[United]]
[[States]].25 These two positions are implicit recognition that [[Native]] [[America]]n
peoples, and their [[government]]s, have lost contractual, [[treaty]]-making parity

with the [[United]] [[States]].

The most telling factor, however, is that [[Native]] [[America]]n [[government]]s
lack sufficient institutional strength to require the various [[States]], or the
federal [[government]] for that matter, to come to the bargaining table
whenever [[treaty]] disputes arise. To obtain any relief at all, they are required
to resort to the courts, and the law, of the [[United]] [[States]]. The various [[States]]

recognize this apparent institutional weakness and act accordingly.
Why do the various [[States]] perceive this apparent institutional weakness?
Perhaps an analogous situation will be enlightening. Consider what happens
when Mr. Smith grants title to his land to Mr. Jones, but reserves the right
to use the land during the remainder of his life. When Mr. Smith dies, there
is absolutely no question his right to use the land is extinguished. After all,
he is dead. By analogy, if the sovereign life of a [[Native]] [[America]]n people
dies, so does their reserved [[treaty]] rights. Many [[America]]ns believe "[[Indian]]"
[[sovereignty]] is a simple matter of [[America]]n [[history]] and, therefore, the
reserved [[treaty]] rights have been extinguished.
Other [[America]]ns, especially the politically conservative, believe allowing
[[Native]] [[America]]ns to have special privileges, e.g., hunting and fishing rights
on ceded territory, is un-[[America]]n. After, all, they argue, all "[[America]]ns"

have equal rights under the law. Because of these perceptions, [[Native]]
[[America]]n peoples can expect continued challenges to the exercise of their
[[treaty]] rights.

Conclusion
[[Native]] [[America]]n peoples continue to face significant challenges to the
[[sovereignty]] which they have so steadfastly claimed. These challenges come

from within ? through the loss of language and culture ? and without ?
from local, state, and federal political forces. To counter these challenges,

[[Native]] [[America]]n peoples must act decisively to insure their [[government]]s
demonstrate the institutional quality of inherently sovereign political
personalities. Otherwise they can expect politically conservative [[America]]ns

to persist in their ridicule of [[Native]] [[America]]n [[treaty]] rights. Moreover,

failure to do so with all deliberate speed will complete the intent of
[[Congress]] expressed in [[March]] [[1871]].
Whether [[Native]] [[America]]n peoples, and their [[government]]s, are
sufficiently resilient to survive even another generation or so remains to be

seen. The challenges are certainly formidable.
