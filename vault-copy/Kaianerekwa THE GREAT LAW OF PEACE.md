Originally from ganienkeh.net/thelaw, retrieved from the Internet Archive after 
the site went out of service in [[December]] [[2020]]. These are published with original
commentary from the website after some of the Wampums.
 
These texts provide an insight into only a fraction of the political thought and
structures that [[Indigenous]] people have developed over thousands of years of 
shifting political landscapes. Some things resonate today with us [[Indigenous]] 
anarchics, while some things don’t. What can be said is that we all stand to 
benefit from reading and considering the [[Great]] Law of Peace.

THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CONFEDERACY
 
WAMPUM #1
DEGANAWIDA AND THE CHIEFS PLANT THE TREE OF PEACE
 
I am Deganawida. With the statesmen of the League of Five Nations, I plant the 
Tree of [[Great]] Peace. I plant it in your territory. Atotarho and the Onondaga 
Nation: in the territory of you who are the Firekeepers. I name the tree 
Tsioneratasekowa, the [[Great]] White Pine. Under the shade of this Tree of [[Great]] 
Peace, we spread the soft, [[white]] feathery down of the Globe Thistle as seats for
you, Atotarho and your cousin statesmen. We place you upon those seats, spread 
soft with the feathery down.of the Globe Thistle, there beneath the shade of the
spreading branches of the Tree of [[Great]] Peace. There shall you sit and watch the
Fire of the League of Five Nations. All the affairs of the League shall be 
transacted at this place before you, Atotarho and your cousin statesmen, by the 
statesmen of the League of Five Nations
 
Note: The term Five Nations makes it evident that all the laws were made before 
[[1714]] at which time the Tuscarora Nation was admitted into the Confederacy, but 
without an equal voice, contrary to the Plan of Deganawida. Apparently, the 
first Grand Councils of the Iroquois Confederacy were held under the evergreen 
[[white]] pine, the largest tree in [[Eastern]] [[North]] [[America]], more than 250 feet high. 
All cut down 200 years ago by the [[white]] men who afterwards never let the great 
tree grow to full size again in their haste and eagerness to exploit it.
 
WAMPUM #2
THE GREAT WHITE ROOTS OF THE TREE OF PEACE
 
Roots have spread out from the Tree of [[Great]] Peace: one to the north, one to the
east, one to the south and one to the west. These are the [[Great]] White Roots and 
their nature is Peace and Strength. If any man or any nation outside of the Five
Nations shall obey the laws of the [[Great]] Peace (Gayanerekowa) and shall make 
this known to the statesmen of the League, they may trace back the roots to the 
Tree. If their minds are clean and if they are obedient and promise to obey the 
wishes of the Council of the League, they shall be welcomed to take shelter 
beneath the Tree of the Long Leaves.
 
We place at the top of the Tree of [[Great]] Peace an eagle who is able to see afar.
If he sees in the distance any danger threatening, he will at once warn the 
people of the League. Note: The translator from the [[Indian]] to English got his 
tree mixed up. Tioneratasekowa does not mean a Tree of Long Leaves, but a [[Great]] 
Tree with ever fresh leaves meaning evergreen or the [[Great]] White Pine. The Tree 
of Long Leaves could not be the White Pine. Unless they had domesticated the 
eagles, it is an allegory meaning that the people must be very watchful.
 
WAMPUM #3
ATOTARHO AND THE ONONDAGA CHIEFS CARETAKERS OF THE COUNCIL FIRE
 
To you, Atotarho, and the Onondaga statesmen, I and the other statesmen of the 
League have entrusted the care taking and watching of the Five Nations Council 
Fire. When there is any business to be transacted and the Council is not in 
session, a messenger shall be sent to either Atotarho, Honowirehton or 
Skanawati, firekeepers or their [[War]] Chief, with a full statement of the business
to be considered. Then Atotarho shall call his cousin chiefs together and 
consider whether the business is of sufficient importance to call the attention 
of the Council of the League: If so, Atotarho shall send messengers to summon 
all the chiefs of the League and to assemble beneath the Tree of [[Great]] Peace. 
When the statesmen are assembled, the Council fire shall be kindled but not with
chestnut wood and Atotarho will formally open the Council. Then shall Atotarho 
and his cousin statesmen, the Firekeepers announce the subject for discussion. 
The smoke of the Council Fire of the League shall ever ascend and pierce the sky
so that the other nations who may be allies may see the council fire of the 
[[Great]] Peace.
 
Note: Chestnut wood throws out angry sparks. The inference here is not to 
inspire angry moods. Seeing “The smoke of the Council Fire ascend the sky” is to
induce friendly neighbors to drop in and sit a spell.
 
WAMPUM #4
THE FIREKEEPERS TO KEEP THE COUNCIL FIRE CLEAN
 
You, Atotarho, and your thirteen cousin statesmen shall faithfully keep the 
space about the Council Fire clean and you shall allow neither dust, nor dirt to
accumulate. I lay along seagull wing (Tiowatatekowa Onerahontsa) before you as a
broom.
 
As a weapon against a crawling creature, I lay a stick with you so that you may 
thrust it away from the Council Fire. If you fail to cast it out, then call the 
rest of the united statesmen to your aid.
 
Note: Keeping the space around the council fire clean may also mean that a well 
conducted council is being recommended and the crawling creature may be a 
disrespectful person or persons seeking to disrupt the council.
 
WAMPUM #5
THE COUNCIL OF THE MOHAWKS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTIES
 
The Council of the [[Mohawk]]s shall be divided into three parts: Tehanakarine, 
Ostawenserentah and Soskoharowane are the first. Tekarihoken, Ayonwatha and 
Satekariwate are the second. Sarenkowane, Teyonhekwen and Orenrekowa are the 
third.
 
The first party is to listen only to the discussion of the second and third 
parties and if an error is made or the proceeding irregular, they are to call 
attention to it and when the case is right and properly decided by the two 
parties, they shall confirm the decision of the two parties and refer the case 
to the Seneca statesmen for their decision. When the Seneca statesmen have 
decided, in accord with the [[Mohawk]] statesmen, the case or question shall be 
referred to the Cayuga and Oneida statesmen on the opposite side of the house.
 
Note: The above is the procedure when the Grand Council of the Iroquois 
Confederacy is in session.
 
WAMPUM #6
DEGANAWIDA APPOINTS THE MOHAWK CHIEFS LEADERS OF THE CONFEDERACY
 
I, Deganawida, appoint the [[Mohawk]] statesmen the head and the leaders of the Five
Nations League. The [[Mohawk]] statesmen are the foundation of the [[Great]] Peace and 
it shall therefore be against the [[Great]] Binding Law to pass measures in the 
Council of the League after the [[Mohawk]] statesmen have [[protest]]ed against them.
 
No Council of the League shall be legal unless all of the statesmen of the 
[[Mohawk]]s are present.
 
Note: The [[Mohawk]]s were the first to accept the [[Great]] Law. They helped the 
Founder, Deganawida, to gather the other nations together. Missionaries admit 
they went all over [[America]] and spread propaganda among the [[Indian]]s against the 
Iroquois Confederacy, especially against the [[Mohawk]]s because they were the “most
militant and great organizers.” The missionaries felt certain they checked the 
spread of the [[Great]] Law which “would have made it impossible for the [[white]] men 
to [[conquer]]. [[America]].”
 
WAMPUM #7
THE GREAT LAW OF PEACE ONONDAGA CHIEFS OPEN THE COUNCIL FIRE OF THE IROQUOIS
 
Whenever the statesmen of the League shall assemble for the purpose of holding a
council, the Onondaga Rotiyaner shall open it by expressing their gratitude to 
their cousin statesmen and greeting them and they shall make and address and 
offer thanks to the Earth where men dwell, to the streams of water, the pools 
and the lakes, to the maize and the fruits, to the medicinal herbs and trees, to
the forest trees for their usefulness, and to the animals that serve as food and
give their pelts for clothing, to the great winds and the lesser winds, to the 
thunderers; to the Sun, the mighty [[warrior]], to the moon; to the messengers of 
the Creator who reveals his wishes and to the [[Great]] Creator who dwells in the 
heavens above who gives all the things useful to men, and who is the source and 
the ruler of [[health]] and life.
 
Then shall the Onondaga Rotiyaner declare the council open. The Council shall 
not sit after darkness has set in.
 
Note: The above opening thanksgiving ritual is done at every gathering of the 
people. The orator gives thanks to all that help human life. Giving thanks to 
the trees, water, winds, etc., does not mean that the people worship all these 
useful gifts but thank the power that produces them. The word Royaner means “he 
makes a good path for the people to follow.” Rotiyaner is in the plural.
 
WAMPUM #8
EVERY ONONDAGA CHIEF MUST BE PRESENT
 
The Firekeepers shall formally open and close all councils of the statesmen of 
the League, they shall pass upon all matters deliberated upon by the two sides 
and render their decision. Every Onondaga statesman (or his deputy) must be 
present at every Council of the League and must agree with the majority without 
unwarrantable dissent, so that a unanimous decision may be rendered.
 
If Atotarho or any of his cousin statesmen are absent from a Council of the 
League, any other Firekeeper may open and close the Council, but the Firekeepers
present may not give any decisions, unless the matter is of small importance.
 
Note: No chief may start any unnecessary arguments or unjustifiably delay the 
progress of the Council.
 
WAMPUM #9
ALL [[ISS]]UES PASSED FIRST BY THE MOHAWKS AND THE SENECAS
All the business of the Five Nations League Council shall be conducted by the 
two combined bodies of Confederate statesmen. First, the question shall be 
passed upon by the [[Mohawk]] and Seneca statesmen, then it shall be discussed and 
passed by the Oneida and Cayuga statesmen. Their decision shall then be referred
to the Onondaga statesmen, the Firekeepers, for final judgment.
 
The same process shall be followed when a question is brought before the Council
by an individual or a [[War]] Chief.
 
WAMPUM #10
THE CAYUGA AND ONEIDA CHIEFS ARE NEXT TO DECIDE
In all cases, the procedure must be as follows: when the [[Mohawk]] and Seneca 
statesmen have unanimously agreed upon a question, they shall report their 
decision to the Cayuga and Oneida statesmen, who shall deliberate upon the 
question and report a unanimous decision to the [[Mohawk]] statesmen. The [[Mohawk]] 
Rotiyaner will then report the standing of the case to the Firekeepers, who 
shall render a decision as they see fit in case of a disagreement by the two 
bodies or confirm the decisions of the two bodies, if they are identical. The 
Firekeepers shall then report their decision to the [[Mohawk]] statesmen who shall 
announce it to the open Council.
 
Note: This means that in case of a disagreement between the two parties, 
[[Mohawk]]-Seneca and Oneida-Cayuga, the Onondaga statesmen shall cast their “vote” 
on one or the other, making it a two thirds majority, making it necessary for 
the one third minority to go along with the decision of the majority and it 
becomes a unanimous decision.
 
WAMPUM #11
CASE MUST BE RECONSIDERED IF THERE IS A DISAGREEMENT
If, through any misunderstanding or obstinacy on the part of the Firekeepers, 
they reach a decision at variance with that of the two sides, the Two Sides 
shall reconsider the matter and if their decisions are jointly the same as 
before, they shall report to the Firekeepers, who are then compelled to confirm 
their joint decision.
 
WAMPUM #12
THE ONONDAGA FIREKEEPERS ARE THE LAST TO DECIDE
When a case comes before the Onondaga, the Firekeepers, for discussion and 
decision, Atotarho shall introduce the matter to his comrade statesmen, who 
shall then discuss it in their two bodies. Every Onondaga statesmen except 
Hononwireton shall deliberate and he shall listen only. When a unanimous 
decision shall have been reached by the two bodies of Firekeepers, Atotarho 
shall notify Hononwireton of the fact, then he shall confirm it. He shall refuse
to confirm a decision if it is not unanimously agreed upon by both sides of the 
Firekeepers.
 
Note: In the Onondaga national council, the party for the final decision is 
comprised of only one individual, Hononwireton; who however has to follow the 
rule which is simply to confirm a unanimous decision or to refuse to confirm a 
decision which was not agreed upon by the two sides. He does not have to take 
part in the de[[liberation]]. It’s already taken care of.
 
WAMPUM #13
CHIEFS TO DELIBERATE IN LOW TONES
No chief shall ask a question of the body of chiefs of the League when they are 
discussing a case, question or proposition. He may only deliberate in a low tone
with the separate body of which he is a member.
 
Note: Such an action by a chief may result in disorder and delay the progress of
the council.
 
WAMPUM #14
THE COUNCIL SHALL APPOINT A SPEAKER FOR THE DAY
When the Council of the Five Nations chiefs shall convene, they shall appoint a 
speaker for the day. He shall be a chief of either the [[Mohawk]], Onondaga or 
Seneca nations.
 
The next day, the Council shall appoint another, but the first speaker may be 
reappointed if there is no objection, but a speaker’s term shall not be regarded
more than a day.
 
WAMPUM #15
ONLY CHIEFS HAVE A VOICE IN THE GRAND COUNCIL
No individual or foreign nation interested in a case, question, or proposition 
shall have any voice in the Council of the League except to answer a question 
put to him by the Speaker of the chiefs.
 
Note: This rule precludes hecklers and rowdy disruptions.
 
WAMPUM #16
IN CASE A NEW LAW IS MADE
If the conditions which shall arise at any future time call for an addition or 
change of this law, the case shall be carefully considered and if a new beam 
seems necessary or beneficial, the proposed change shall be decided upon and if 
adopted, shall be called, “Added to the Rafters.”
 
Note: This points out the law-making privileges of the Rotiyaner.
 
RIGHTS, DUTIES, AND QUALIFICATIONS OF THE STATESMEN
 
WAMPUM #17
CLAN MOTHERS TO HOLD CHIEFTAINSHIP TITLES VIA WAMPUM STRINGS
A bunch of certain shell (wampum) strings, each two spans in length, shall be 
given to each of the female families in which the. chieftainship titles are 
vested. The right of bestowing the titles shall be hereditary in the family of 
females legally possessing the bunch of shell strings and the strings shall be 
the token that the females of the family have the ownership to the chieftainship
title for all time to come, subject to certain restrictions mentioned here
 
Note: The families mentioned are political families called the “Clan.” The women
in possession of the Chieftainship -title wampum strings are Clan Mothers. Like 
the Rotiyaner (Chiefs), the Clan Mother can be deposed if she does a serious 
wrong at which time another woman will be installed in her place as the Clan 
Mother.
 
WAMPUM #18
CHIEF DEPOSED IF HE REFUSES TO ATTEND A COUNCIL FIRE
If any chief of the League neglects or refuses to attend the Council of the 
League, the other Chiefs of the nation of which he is a member shall require 
their [[War]] Chief to request the female sponsors of the Chief so guilty of 
neglecting his duties to demand his attendance at the Council. If he refuses, 
the women holding the title shall immediately select another candidate for the 
title. No chief shall be asked more than once to attend the Council of the 
League.
 
Note: The Clan Mother deposes the errant. chief. The [[War]] Chief delivers the 
order by reciting the words of deposition to the errant chief. The three Clan 
mothers of the Clan of the deposed chief immediately choose another Royaner.
 
WAMPUM #19
AN ERRANT CHIEF DEPOSED BY CLAN MOTHER THROUGH THE WAR CHIEF
If at any time it shall be apparent that a chief of the League has not in mind 
the [[welfare]] of the people or disobeys the rules of the [[Great]] Law, the men or 
women of the League, or both jointly, shall come to the Council and scold the 
erring chief through his [[War]] Chief. If the complaint of the people through the 
[[War]] Chief is not heeded on the first occasion, it shall be uttered again and 
then if no attention is given, a third complaint and a warning shall be given. 
If the chief is still disobedient, the matter shall go to the Council of [[War]] 
Chiefs. The [[War]] Chiefs shall then take away the title of the erring chief by 
order of the women in whom the title is. vested. When the chief is deposed, the 
women shall notify the chiefs of the League through their [[War]] Chief and the 
Chiefs of the League shall sanction the act. The women will then select another 
of their sons as a candidate and the chiefs shall elect him. Then the chosen one
shall be installed by the Installation Ceremony.
 
When a chief is deposed, his [[War]] Chief shall address him as follows:
“So you, …, disregard and set at naught the warnings of your women relatives. 
You fling the warnings over your shoulder to cast them behind. Behold the 
brightness of the Sun, and in the brightness of the Sun’s light, I depose you of
your tide and remove the emblem of your chieftainship title. I remove from your 
brow the deer’s antlers which was the emblem of your position and token of your 
nobility. I now depose you and return the antlers to the women whose heritage 
they are.”
The [[War]] Chief shall now address the women of the deposed Chief and say:
“Mothers as I have deposed your chief, I now return to you the emblem and the 
title of chieftainship; therefore, repossess them.”
Again addressing the deposed chief, he shall say:
“As I have deposed and discharged you, so you are no longer chief. The rest of 
the people of the League shall not go with you, for we know not the kind of mind
you possess. As the Creator has nothing to do with wrong, so he will not come to
rescue you from the precipice of destruction in which you have cast yourself. 
You shall never be restored to the position you once occupied.”
Then shall the [[War]] Chief address himself to the Chiefs of the nation to which 
the deposed chief belongs and say:
“Know you, my chiefs, that I have taken the deer’s antlers from the brow of …, 
the emblem of his position and token of his greatness:”
The chiefs of the League shall have no other alternative than to sanction the 
discharge of the offending chief.
 
WAMPUM #20
FOR THE CHIEF GUILTY OF MURDER
If a chief of the League of Five Nations should commit murder, the other chiefs 
of the nation shall assemble at the place where the corpse lies and prepare to 
depose the criminal chief. If it is impossible to meet at the scene of the 
crime, the chiefs shall discuss the matter at the next Council of their nation 
and request their [[War]] Chief to depose the chief guilty of the crime, to “bury 
his women relatives” and to transfer the chieftainship title to a sister family.
 
The [[War]] Chief shall address the chief guilty of murder and say:
“So you,…, did [[kill]] … with your own hands! You have committed a grave crime in 
the eyes of the Creator. Behold the bright light of the Sun and in the 
brightness of the Sun’s light, I depose you of your title and remove the horns, 
the sacred emblems of your chieftainship title. I remove from your brow the 
deer’s antlers which was the emblem of your position and token of your nobility.
I now depose you and expel you and you shall depart at once from the territory 
of the League of the Five Nations and never more return again. We, the League of
Five Nations, moreover, bury your women relatives because the ancient 
chieftainship title was never intended to have any union with bloodshed. 
Henceforth, it shall not be their heritage. By the evil deed that you have done 
they have forfeited it forever.”
The [[War]] Chief shall then hand the title to a sister family and he shall address 
it and say:
“Our Mothers, …, Listen attentively while I address you on a solemn and 
important subject. I hereby transfer to you an ancient chieftainship title for a
great calamity has befallen it in the hands of the family of a former chief. We 
trust that you, our Mothers, will always guard it and that you will warn your 
chief always to be dutiful and to advise his people to ever live in love, peace 
and harmony that a great calamity may never happen again.”
Note: “Bury his women relatives” means political relatives. “Sister Family” is a
part of a clan which is composed of three parts with a Chief and a Clan Mother 
in each part. The Chieftainship Title is lost by the involved part and 
transferred to another part of the clan. “His women relatives” is that one third
part of the clan associated with the deposed [[kill]]er chief. “Family of a former 
chief’; political family of the,deposed chief, a third part of the clan.
 
WAMPUM #21
CERTAIN DEFECTS RESTRICT A CHIEF
Certain physical defects in a statesman of the League makes him ineligible to 
sit in the League Council. Such defects as infancy, idiocy, blindness, deafness,
dumbness and impotency. When a statesman of the League is restricted by any of 
these conditions, a deputy shall be appointed by his sponsors to act for him, 
but in cases of extreme necessity, the restricted statesman may exercise his 
rights. 
 
WAMPUM #22
CHIEF MAY OR MAY NOT RESIGN IF ACTIVE CHIEFS REFUSE TO ACCEPT HIS RESIGNATION
If a statesman of the League desires to resign his title, he shall notify the 
statesmen of the nation of which he is a member of his intentions. . If his 
co-active statesmen refuse to accept his resignation, he may not resign his 
title.
 
A statesman, in proposing to resign, may recommend any proper candidate which 
recommendation shall be received by the statesman but unless confirmed and 
nominated by the women who hold the title, the candidate shall not be 
considered.
 
WAMPUM #23
ON CHIEFS MAKING WAMPUM STRINGS OR BELTS
Any chief of the League of Five Nations may construct shell strings or wampum 
belts of any size of length as pledges or records of matters of national and 
international importance.
 
When it is necessary to dispatch a shell string by a [[War]] Chief or other 
messenger as a token of summons, the messenger shall recite the contents of the 
string to whom it is sent. That party shall’ repeat the message and if there has
been a summons, he shall make ready for his journey.
 
Any of the people of the Five Nations may use shells or wampum as the record of 
a pledge, contract or an agreement entered into and the same shall be binding as
soon as shell strings have been exchanged by both parties.
 
WAMPUM #24
THE SKINS OF CHIEFS SHALL BE SEVEN SPANS THICK
The chiefs of the League of Five Nations shall be mentors of the people for all 
time. The thickness of their skin shall be seven spans nine 
(tsatahniioronkarakeh), which is to say that they shall be proof against anger; 
offensive ‘action and criticism. Their hearts hall be full of peace and good 
will, and their minds filled with a yearning for the people of the League. With 
endless patience, they shall carry out their duty. Their firmness shall be 
tempered with a tenderness for their people. Neither anger nor fury shall find 
lodging in their minds and all their words and actions shall be marked by calm 
de[[liberation]].
 
WAMPUM #25
CHIEF SEEKING INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY WILL BE DEPOSED
If a chief of the League should seek to establish any authority independent of 
the jurisdiction of the League of the [[Great]] Peace, which is the Five Nations, he
shall be warned three times in open Council: first by the women relatives, 
second by the men relatives, and finally by the chiefs of the Nation to which he
belongs.
 
If the offending chief is still persistent, he shall be dismissed by the [[War]] 
Chief of his Nation for refusing to conform to the laws of the [[Great]] Peace. His 
Nation shall then install the candidate nominated by the female name holders of 
his family.
 
Note: Again, the “relatives” are the people of the Clan. Political relatives. 
The ‘female name holders of his family” are the Clan Mothers of the Clan. The 
“name” is the title given to each Royaner while he is going through the ceremony
of becoming a Royaner. The title he gets is the name of the original Chief whose
place he assumes when installed as a Royaner.
 
WAMPUM #26
THE CHIEFS AS TEACHERS AND SPIRITUAL GUIDES
It shall be the duty of all the chiefs of the League of Five Nations from time 
to time as occasion demands to act as teachers and spiritual guides of their 
people and remind them of their Creator’s will and words.
 
They shall say:
“Listen, that peace may continue unto future days! “Always listen to the words 
of the [[Great]] Creator, for he has spoken. “[[United]] People, let no evil find 
lodging in your minds. “For the [[Great]] Creator has spoken and the Cause of Peace 
shall not become old. “The cause of Peace shall not die if you remember the 
[[Great]] Creator.”
Note: [[Great]] faith shown here.
 
WAMPUM #27
ALL CHIEFS MUST BE HONEST
All chiefs of the League of Five Nations must be honest in all things. They must
not idle and gossip, but be men possessing those honorable qualities that make 
true leaders. It shall be a serious wrong for anyone to lead a chief into 
trivial affairs for the people must ever hold their chiefs high in estimation 
out of respect to their honorable positions.
 
WAMPUM #28
A NEW CHIEF MUST MAKE PLEDGE VIA FOUR STRINGS OF WAMPUM
When a candidate Chief is to be installed, he shall furnish four strings of 
shells or wampum one span in length bound together at one end. Such will 
constitute the evidence of his pledge to the chiefs of the League that he will 
live according to the Constitution of the [[Great]] Peace and exercise justice in 
all affairs.
 
When the pledge is furnished, the Speaker of the Council must hold the shell 
strings in his hand and address the opposite side of the Council Fire and he 
shall begin his address saying:
“Now behold him. He has now become a chief of the League. See how splendid he 
looks.”
An address may then follow. At the end of it, he shall send the bunch of shell 
strings to the opposite side and they shall be received as evidence of the 
pledge. Then shall the opposite side say:
“We now do crown you with the sacred emblem of the deer’s antlers, the emblem of
your chieftainship. You shall now become a mentor of the people of the Five 
Nations. The thickness of your skin shall be seven spans, which is to say that 
you shall be proof against anger, offensive actions and criticism. Your heart 
shall be filled with peace and good will. Your mind shall be filled with a 
yearning for the [[welfare]] of the people of the League. With endless patience you 
shall carry out your duty and your firmness shall be tempered with tenderness 
for your people. Neither anger nor fury shall find lodging in your mind. All 
your words and actions shall be marked with calm de[[liberation]]. In all your 
de[[liberation]]s in the Council of the League, in your efforts at law-making, in 
all your official acts, self-interest shall be cast away. Do not cast over your 
shoulder behind you the warnings of your nephews and nieces should they chide 
you for any error or wrong you may do, but return to the [[Great]] Law which is 
right and just. Look and listen for the [[welfare]] of the whole people, and have 
always in view not only the present, but also the coming generations, even those
whose faces are yet beneath the surface of the ground – the unborn of the future
Nation.”
 
Note: A condolence ceremony is performed when a chief dies and a new one is 
installed. The candidate Chief shall make or buy the required string wampum, 
four strings of one span (four inches) in length tied together at one end. The 
Clan Mother keeps the string wampum after the Installation Ceremony. In the 
address, the Royaner holds the string pledge wampum in his hand. The Rotiyaner 
of the opposite side of the Council Fire from the Candidate Chief shall do the 
Installation Ceremony. That is, the [[Mohawk]], Seneca and Onondaga Rotiyaner shall 
be installed by the Oneida and Cayuga Rotiyaner and vice versa.
 
WAMPUM #29
THE NEW CHIEF SHALL FURNISH THE FOOD FOR THE CELEBRATIONS
When a chieftainship title is to be conferred, the candidate chief shall furnish
the cooked venison, the [[corn]] bread and the [[corn]] soup, together with other 
necessary things and the labor for the Conferring of Titles Festival.
 
WAMPUM #30
CHIEFTAINSHIP TITLE CAN BE CONFERRED WHEN THE GREAT LAW IS RECITED
The chiefs of the League may confer the Chieftainship title whenever the [[Great]] 
Law is recited, if there is a candidate, for the [[Great]] Law speaks all the rules.
 
WAMPUM #31
A SERIOUSLY ILL CHIEF TEMPORARILY DEPOSED
If a chief of the League should become seriously ill and be thought near [[death]], 
the women who are the heirs of his title shall go to his house and lift his 
crown of deer antlers, the emblem of his Chieftainship, and place them at one 
side. If the Creator spares him and he rises from his bed of sickness, he may 
rise with the antlers on his brow.
 
The following words shall be used to temporarily remove the antlers:
“Now our comrade chief, the time has come when we must approach you in your 
illness. We remove for a time the deer’s antlers from your brow. We remove the 
emblem of your Chieftainship title. The [[Great]] Law has decreed that no chief 
should end his life with the antlers on his brow. We, therefore, lay them aside 
in the room. If the Creator spares you and you recover from your illness, you 
shall resume your duties as chief of the League and you may again labor for the 
people of the League.”
Note: The Clan Mothers depose a chief before he dies. He must not take the title
with him to the grave. The title will be inherited by his successor.
 
WAMPUM #32
NO COUNCIL FOR TEN DAYS WHEN A CHIEF DIES
If a chief of the League should die while the Council of the Five Nations is in 
session, the Council shall adjourn for ten days. No Council of the League shall 
sit within ten days of the [[death]] of a Chief of the League.
 
If the Three Brothers (ahsennihontatehkenah) (the [[Mohawk]]s, the Onondaga and the 
Seneca) should lose one of their chiefs by [[death]], the Younger Brother 
(iatatehkenah) (the Cayuga and the Oneida) shall come to the surviving chiefs of
the Three Brothers on the tenth day and console them. If the Younger Brothers 
lose one of their chiefs, then the Three Brothers shall come to them and console
them. And the consolation shall be the reading of the contents of the thirteenth
shell wampum of Ayonwatha. At the termination of this rite, a successor shall be
appointed by the women heirs of the chieftainship title. If the women are not 
ready to place their nominee before the chiefs, the Speaker shall say:
 
“Come let us go out.”
All shall then leave the Council or place of gathering. The Speaker shall lead 
the way from the house by saying:
“Let us depart to the edge of the woods and lie in wait on our bellies.” 
(Tenshakonatioswentarese).
When the women title holders shall have chosen one of.their sons, the chiefs of 
the League will assemble in two places, the Younger Brothers in one place and 
the three Older Brothers in another. The chiefs who are to console the mourning 
chiefs shall choose one of their number to sing the Song of Peace as they 
journey to the sorrowing chiefs. The singer shall lead the way and the chiefs 
and the people shall follow. When they reach the sorrowing chiefs, they shall 
hail the candidate chief and perform the rite of Conferring the Chieftainship 
title. (Ohkeiontentshera)
 
Note: “Women’ heirs of the Chieftainship Title” means that the Clan Mothers are 
keepers of the Chiefs string wampum which he turns over to his Clan Mother 
before he is given the title at the Conferring of Chieftainship rite. The title 
is the name of the original Chief in whose position the Candidate Royaner is 
inheriting. “When the women title holders shall have chosen one of the sons,” 
means political sons or men of the particular Clan concerned, not necessarily 
any of their natural sons.
 
WAMPUM #33
WHEN A CHIEF DIES ALL IROQUOIS CHIEFS ARE NOTIFIED
When a chief of the League dies, the surviving relatives shall immediately 
dispatch a messenger, a mentor of another clan, to the chiefs in another 
locality. When the runner comes within hailing distance of the locality, he 
shall utter a sad wail, thusly: “Kwa-ah! Kwa-ah!” The sound shall be repeated 
three times, and then again and again at intervals as many times as the distance
may require. When the runner arrives at the settlement, the people shall 
assemble and one must ask the nature of his sad message.
 
He shall then say:
“Let us consider.” (rakwennikonriak).
Then he shall tell them of the [[death]] of the chief. He shall deliver to them a 
string of shells or wampum and say:
“Here is the testimony, you have heard the message.”
He then may return home.
It now becomes the duty of the chiefs of the locality to send runners to other 
localities and each locality shall send messengers until all chiefs are 
notified. Runners shall travel day and night.
 
Note: The mourning relatives (members of the same clan) are consoled by the 
members of the clan that sits opposite to them at the Council Fire. They also do
the running to distant chiefs. When their own chief dies, then the favor is 
returned.
 
WAMPUM #34
NO CHIEF MAY CARRY HIS TITLE TO THE GRAVE
If a chief dies and there is no candidate qualified for the office in the family
of the women title holders, the chief of the Nation shall give the title into 
the hands of a sister family (Kentennonteron) in the clan until such time as the
original family produces a candidate, when the title shall be restored to the 
rightful owners.
 
No chieftainship title may be carried into the grave. The chiefs of the League 
may dispossess a dead chief of his title even at the grave.
 
Note: “Sister family in the clan.” There are three chiefs and three Clan Mothers
in each Clan. Each chief and each clan mother represent a ‘family” or a 
political family in the Clan. Makes it easy to reach decisions in Clan Councils.
The Chieftainship Titles have been in existence since the Confederacy was 
founded and must not be buried.
 
PINE TREE CHIEF
 
WAMPUM #35
THE PINE TREE CHIEF
Should any man of the Nation assist with special ability or show great interest 
in the affairs of the Nation, if he proves himself wise and honest and worthy of
confidence, the Chiefs of the League may elect him to a seat among them and he 
may sit in the Council of the League. He shall be proclaimed a Pine Tree, sprung
up for the Nation, and be installed as such at the next assembly for the 
installation of chiefs. Should he ever do anything contrary to the rules of the 
[[Great]] Peace, he may not be deposed from office – no one shall cut him down – but
thereafter every one shall be deaf to his voice and his advice. Should he resign
from his seat and title, no one shall prevent it. A Pine Tree Chief has no 
authority to name a successor, nor is his title hereditary.
 
THE WAR CHIEFS
 
WAMPUM #36
THE TITLE NAMES OF THE FIVE WAR CHIEFS
The title names of the [[War]] Chiefs of the League shall be:
Ayonwehs: war chief under Chief Tekarihoken([[Mohawk]]).
Kahonwaitiron: war chief under Chief Otatsheteh(Oneida).
Ayentes: war chief under Chief Atotarho(Onondaga).
Wenens: war chief under Chief Dekaenyon(Cayuga).
Shoneratowaneh: war chief under Chief Skanyatariio(Seneca).
The women heirs of each head chiefs title shall be the heirs of war chiefs title
of their respective chief.
 
The war chiefs shall be selected from the eligible sons of the female families 
holding the chieftainship title.
 
Note: [[War]] Chiefs ruled absolutely over the nations when the Iroquois Confederacy
was formed. The ruling war chiefs were Tekarihoken for the [[Mohawk]]s, Atateheteh 
for the Oneidas, Atotarho for the Onondagas, Dekaenyon for the Cayugas and 
Skanyatariio for the Senecas. They all became part of the 49 Chiefs in the new 
order devised by Deganawida, Founder of the Iroquois Confederacy. They became 
Peace Chiefs and anew order for protection and defense was devised and the new 
category of [[War]] Chiefs established and they included Ayonwehs for the [[Mohawk]]s, 
Kahonwaitiron for the Oneidas, Ayentes for the Onondagas, Wenens for the Cayugas
and Shoreratowaneh for the Senecas and these new [[War]] Chiefs took instructions 
and directions from the former rulers of the Nations.
 
The Gayanerekowa has definite functions for the [[War]] Chief and his men ([[War]]rior 
Society). They are charged with the protection, defense and [[welfare]] of the 
people. These duties may take many forms, such as keeping the peace, teaching, 
speaking to the people, repossessing lost lands, maintaining human rights, 
diplomatic relations with other nations, and any other work that promotes the 
[[welfare]] of the people.
 
WAMPUM #37
ONE WAR CHIEF FOR EACH NATION AND THEIR FUNCTIONS
There shall be one [[War]] Chief for each Nation and their duties shall be to carry 
messages for their chiefs and to take up arms in case of emergency. They shall 
not participate in the proceedings of the Council, but shall watch its progress 
and in case of an erroneous action by a chief, the [[War]]. Chiefs shall receive the
complaints of the people and convey the warnings of the women to him. The people
who wish to convey messages to the Chiefs of the League shall do so through the 
[[War]] Chief of their Nation. It shall always be his duty to lay the cases, 
questions and propositions of the people before the Council of the League.
 
WAMPUM #38
WHEN A WAR CHIEF DIES ANOTHER IS INSTALLED
When a [[War]] Chief dies, another shall be installed by the same rite as that by 
which a Chief (of the Council) is installed.
 
WAMPUM #39
WHEN A WAR CHIEF ACTS AGAINST THE GREAT LAW
If a [[War]] Chief acts contrary to instructions or against the provisions of the 
Laws of the [[Great]] Peace; doing so in the capacity of his office, he shall be 
deposed by his women relatives and by his men relatives. Either the women alone 
or the men alone or jointly may act in such a case. The women title holders 
shall then choose another candidate.
 
Note: The people of the Clans here show their power. The women title holders 
are, of course, the Clan Mothers.
 
WAMPUM #40
WHEN THE CHIEFS SEND A MESSENGER FOR THE COUNCIL
When the chiefs of the League take occasion to dispatch a messenger on behalf of
the Council of the League, they shall wrap up any matter they may send and 
instruct the messenger to remember his errand to turn not aside, but to proceed 
faithfully to his destination and deliver his message according to every 
instruction.
 
WAMPUM #41
HOW THE MESSENGER SHALL PROCEED
If a message borne by a runner is the warning of an invasion, he shall whoop: 
“Kwa-ah, Kwa-ah!” twice and repeat at short intervals, then again at a longer 
interval.
 
If a human is found dead, the finder shall not touch the body, but return home 
immediately shouting at short intervals “Koo-weh!”
 
THE CLANS
 
WAMPUM #42
TITLES OF CLANS
Among the Five Nations and their descendants there shall be the following Clans:
Bear, Eel, Snipe, Beaver, Hawk, Turtle, Deer, Heron, Wolf
These Clans distributed through their respected nations shall be the. sole 
owners and holders of the soil of the country and in them is vested, as a 
birthright.
 
Note: There are clans other than these among the S Nations.The [[Europe]]ans, not 
being members of any of these Clans, have no right to own any land in this part 
of the world.
 
WAMPUM #43
MEMBERS OF THE SAME CLAN IN OTHER NATIONS
People of the Five Nations who are members of a certain clan shall recognize 
every member of the Clan no matter what Nation, as relatives. Men and women, 
therefore, who are members of the same Clan are forbidden to marry.
 
WAMPUM #44
LINEAL DESCENT OF THE PEOPLE RUNS IN THE FEMALE LINE
The lineal descent of the people of the Five Nations shall run in the female 
line. Women shall be considered the Progenitors of the Nation. They shall own 
the land and the soil. Men and women shall follow the status of their mothers.
 
WAMPUM #45
THE CLAN MOTHERS, WOMEN TITLE HOLDERS
The women heirs of the chieftainship titles of the League shall be called Oyaner
or Otiyaner for all time to come.
 
Note: The Clan Mothers shall be called Oyaner. Oyaner is derived from the word 
Oyana meaning “path “. Oyaner is the female “good path maker.” Otiyaner is in 
the plural. Royaner means, “He makes a good path for people to follow.” 
Rotiyaner is in the plural.
 
WAMPUM #46
CLAN MOTHERS ARE KEEPERS OF THE AUTHORIZED NAMES
The women of the 48 (now 50) noble families shall be the heirs of the authorized
names for all time to come.
 
When an infant of the Five Nations is given an Authorized Name at the Midwinter 
Festival or at the Green Corn and Strawberry and Harvest Festival, one in the 
cousinhood of which the infant is a member shall be appointed a speaker. He 
shall announce to the opposite cousinhood the names of the father and mother of 
the [[child]] together with the clan of the mother. Then the speaker shall announce 
the [[child]]’s name twice. The uncle of the [[child]] shall then take the [[child]] in his 
arms and walking up and down the room shall sing, “My head is firm; I am of the 
League.” As he sings, the opposite cousinhood shall respond by chanting: “Hyen, 
Hyen, Hyen, Hyen…”, until the song is ended.
 
Note: The “cousinhood” is the other Clan. The purpose of announcing the Clan of 
the mother is to point out the Clan of the [[child]]. A [[child]] is born a [[Mohawk]], 
Oneida, Onondaga, etc., but when he is named in the [[Great]] Law ceremony, the 
[[child]] becomes an Iroquois or Rotinonsonni. He is a [[Mohawk]] by blood and an 
Iroquois by law, for Gayanerekowa is also known as the [[Great]]. Law, is the 
Constitution of the Kanonsonnionwe or the Iroquois Confederacy. By the same 
token, if an individual or a whole Nation leaves the Iroquois Confederacy and in
time realizes their great error and decide to be reinstated, then would be 
required to go. through the Naming Ceremony or in their case, a re-naming 
ceremony and hold the Pledge Wampum and re-accept the [[Great]] Law and this act 
could be called the Iroquois Pledge of Allegiance.
 
WAMPUM #47
IN CASE CLAN MOTHERS BECOME EXTINCT
If the female heirs of a title of a chief of the League becomes extinct, the 
title shall be given by the chiefs of the League to a sister family whom they 
shall elect, and that family shall hold the name and transmit it to their female
heirs, but they shall not appoint any of their sons as a candidate for a title 
until all the eligible men of the former family shall have died, or otherwise 
have become ineligible.
 
Note: If the Clan Mothers who hold a Royaner Title become extinct, the Chiefs of
the Confederacy shall give the Royaner title to another of the three parties 
making up the clan, but they will not appoint a Royaner until all the eligible 
men in the former clan (family) have died. Which means that the Chiefs of the 
Confederacy can institute a new clan if necessary.
 
WAMPUM #48
IN CASE ALL THE CLAN MOTHERS BECOME EXTINCT
If all the heirs of a chieftainship become extinct, and so all the families in 
the Clan, then the title shall be given by the chiefs of the League to a family 
of a sister Clan whom they shall elect.
 
Note: The chiefs shall take from a large clan and make a new clan or keep up the
extinct clan so that the title shall not be lost.
 
WAMPUM #49
IF A CLAN MOTHER REFUSES TO BESTOW A CHIEFTAINSHIP TITLE
If any of the Otiyaner women, heirs of a titleship, shall willfully withhold a 
chieftainship or other title and refuse to bestow it, or if such heirs abandon, 
forsake or despise their heritage, then shall such women be deemed buried, and 
their family extinct. The titleship shall then revert to a sister family or 
Clan, upon application and complaint. The chiefs of the League shall elect the 
family or Clan which shall in future hold the title.
 
Note: How political rights are lost by one of the three parties of a Clan when 
it’s Clan Mother refuses to follow the rules of her position.
 
WAMPUM #50
CLAN MOTHER’S DUTY IF A CHIEF HOLDS A CONFERENCE AT HIS HOME
The Otiyaner women of the League, heirs of the chieftainship titles, shall elect
two women of their family as cooks for the chief when the people shall assemble 
at his house for business or other purposes.
 
WAMPUM #51
FOR A CHIEF HOLDING A CONFERENCE WITH OTHER CHIEFS AT HIS HOME
When a chief holds a conference in his home, his wife, if she wishes, may 
prepare the food for the union chiefs who assemble with him. This is an 
honorable right which she may exercise and an expression of her esteem.
 
WAMPUM #52
HOW CLAN MOTHERS CORRECT ERRING CHIEFS
The Otiyaner women, heirs of the chieftainship titles, shall, should it be 
necessary, correct and admonish the holders of the titles. Those only who attend
the Council may do this and those who do not shall not object to what has been 
said nor strive to undo the action.
 
Note: The Clan Mothers (Otiyaner) may correct and give friendly advice to the 
Rotiyaner (Chiefs).
 
WAMPUM #53
RULES FOR CLAN MOTHERS TO FOLLOW IN SELECTING A NEW CHIEF
When the Otiyaner women, holders of a chieftainship title, select one of their 
sons as a candidate, they shall select one who is trustworthy, of good 
character, of honest disposition, one who manages his own affairs, and supports 
his own family, if any, and who has proven a faithful man to his nation.
 
Note: When the Clan Mothers “select one of their sons” it means one of the men 
in the Clan who has the proper qualifications. It does not necessarily mean one 
of their own natural sons, the Clan being a political family.
 
WAMPUM #54
CLAN MOTHERS HOLD A COUNCIL TO SELECT A NEW CHIEF
When a chieftainship title becomes vacant through [[death]] or other cause, the 
Otiyaner women of the Clan in which the title is hereditary shall hold a council
and shall choose one of their sons to fill the office made vacant. Such a 
candidate shall not be the father of any chief of the League. If the choice is 
unanimous, the name is referred to the men relatives of the Clan. If they should
disapprove, it shall be their duty to select a candidate from among their own 
number. If then the men and women are unable to decide which of the two 
candidates shall be named, then the matter shall be referred to the chiefs of 
the League in the Clan. They shall decide which candidate shall be named. If the
men and women agree to a candidate, then his. name shall be referred to the 
sister clan for confirmation. If the sister clans confirm the choice, they shall
refer their action to the chiefs of the League who shall ratify the choice and 
present it to their cousin chiefs, and if the cousin chiefs confirm the name, 
then the candidate shall be installed by the proper ceremony for the conferring 
of chieftainship titles.
 
Note: Again, “one of their sons” means the eligible men of the Clan. The. new 
chief shall have to meet with the approval of all the men, women, Clan Mothers 
and other Chiefs.
 
THE SYMBOLS
 
WAMPUM #55
ALL CHIEFS CONTRIBUTE TO THE MAKING OF GRAND COUNCIL WAMPUM STRINGS
A large bunch of shell strings, in the making of which the Five Nations League 
Chiefs have equally contributed, shall symbolize the completeness of the unions,
and certify the pledge of the Nations, represented by the chiefs of the League 
of the [[Mohawk]], the Oneida, The Onondaga, the Cayuga, and the Seneca, that all 
are united and formed into one body, or union, called the Union of the [[Great]] Law
which they have established.
 
A bunch of shell strings is to be the symbol of the Council Fire of the League 
of Five Nations. And the chief whom the Council of Firekeepers shall appoint to 
speak for them in opening the Council shall hold the strands of shell in his 
hands when speaking. When he finishes speaking, he shall place the strings on an
elevated place or pole so that all the assembled chiefs and the people may see 
it and know that the Council is open and in progress.
 
WAMPUM #59
IN CASE ANY OR ALL CHIEFS GO AGAINST THE GREAT LAW,
THEY MAY EITHER BE DEPOSED OR EXECUTED BY THE WAR CHIEF AND HIS MEN
A bunch of wampum strings, three spans of the hand in length, the upper half of 
the bunch being [[white]] and the lower half black, and formed from equal 
contributions of the men of the Five Nations, shall be the token that the men 
have combined themselves into one head, one body and one thought, and it shall 
symbolize their ratification of the peace pact of the League, whereby the Chiefs
of the Five Nations have established the [[Great]] Peace. The [[white]] portion of the 
shell strings represent the women and the black portion of men. The black 
portion, furthermore, is a token of power and authority vested in the men of the
Five Nations.
 
This string of wampum vests the people with the right to correct their erring 
chiefs. In case a part of the chiefs or all of them pursue a course not vouched 
for by the people and heed not the third warning of their women relatives 
(Wasenensawenrate). Then the matter shall be taken to the general council of the
Women of the Five Nations. If the chiefs notified and warned three times fail to
heed, then the case falls into the hands of the men of the Five Nations. The [[War]]
Chiefs shall then by right of such power and authority, enter the open Council 
to warn the chief or chiefs to return from their wrong course.
 
If the chiefs heed the warning, they shall say:
“We shall reply tomorrow.”
If then an answer is returned in favor of justice and in accord with the [[Great]] 
Law, then the Chiefs shall individually pledge themselves again, by again 
furnishing the necessary shells for the pledge. Then shall the [[War]] Chief or 
Chiefs exhort the chiefs, urging them to be just and true.
 
Should it happen that the chiefs refuse to heed the third warning, then two 
courses are open: either the men may decide in their council to depose the chief
or chiefs, or to club them to [[death]] with war clubs. Should they in their council
decide to take the first course, the [[War]] Chief shall address the chief or chiefs
saying:
“Since you, the chiefs of the Five Nations, have refused to return to the 
procedure of the Constitution, we now declare your seats vacant and we take off 
your horns, the token of your chieftainship, and others shall be chosen and 
installed in your seats. Therefore, vacate your seats.”
Should the men in their council adopt the second course, the [[War]] Chief shall 
order his men to enter the Council, to take positions beside the errant chiefs 
sitting between them wherever possible. When this is accomplished, the [[War]] Chief
holding in his outstretched hand a bunch of black wampum strings shall say to 
the erring chiefs:
“So now, Chiefs of the Five Nations, harken to these last words from your men. 
You have not heeded the warnings of the General Council of Women and you have 
not heeded the warnings of the Men of the Nations, all during you to the right 
course of action. Since you are determined to resist and to withhold justice 
from you people, there is only one course for us to adopt.”
At this point, the [[War]] Chiefs shall drop the bunch of black wampum and the men 
shall spring to their feet and club the erring chiefs to [[death]]. Any erring chief
may become submissive before the [[War]] Chief lets fall the Black Wampum. The Black
Wampum here used symbolizes that the power to execute is buried, but it may be 
raised up again by the men. It is buried, but when the occasion arises, they may
pull it up and derive their power and authority to act as here described.
 
Note: The right to decide on execution is held by both the General Council of 
the Men of the Five Nations and the General Council of the Women of the Five 
Nations. So is the right to decide on war. The “[[War]] Chief shall order his men.” 
In the present century a new title has been given to the [[War]] Chief and his men: 
“The [[War]]rior Society.”
 
WAMPUM #60
WAMPUM BELT OF THE IROQUOIS CONFEDERACY
A broad belt of wampum of thirty-eight rows, having a [[white]] heart in the center,
on either side of which are two [[white]] squares all connected with the heart by 
[[white]] rows of beads shall be the emblem of the Five Nations.
 
The first of the squares on the left represents the [[Mohawk]] Nation and its 
territory, the second square on the left and near the heart represents the 
Oneida Nation and its territory, and the [[white]] heart in the middle represents 
the Onondaga Nation and its territory. It also means that the heart of the Five 
Nations is single in its loyalty to the [[Great]] Peace, and that the [[Great]] Peace is
lodged in the hear (meaning with Onondaga League Chiefs) and that the Council 
Fire is to bum there for the Five Nations. Further it means that the authority 
is given to advance the cause of peace whereby hostile nations out of the League
shall cease [[warfare]]. The [[white]] square to the right of the heart represents the 
Cayuga Nation and its territory and the fourth and last square represents the 
Seneca Nation and its territory. White here symbolizes that no evil nor jealous 
thoughts shall creep into the minds of the chiefs while in Council under the 
[[Great]] Peace, White the emblem of peace, love, charity, and equity surrounds and 
guards the Five Nations.
 
Ayonwatha Belt
Note: The above Wampum Belt was made by Ayonwatha (Hiawatha to the [[white]] man) to
commemorate the making of the [[Great]] Law.
 
WAMPUM #61
IN CASE A GREAT CALAMITY THREATENS
Should a great calamity threaten the generations rising and living of the Five 
Nations, then he who is able to climb to the top of the Tree of the [[Great]] Long 
Leaves (White Pine) may do so. When he reaches the top of the Tree, he shall 
look about in all directions and should he see evil things indeed approaching, 
then he shall call to the people of the Five [[United]] Nations assembled beneath 
the Tree of the [[Great]] Peace and say:
“A calamity threatens your happiness.”
Then shall the Chiefs convene in Council and discuss the impending evil. When 
all the truths relating to the trouble shall be fully known and found to be 
truths, then shall the people seek a tree of Kahnonkaahkona, the great swamp elm
tree and when they shall find it they shall assemble their heads together and 
lodge for a time between its roots. Then, their labors being finished, they may 
hope for happiness for many more days after.
 
Note: This is ancient man’s way of warning the people to be ever on the alert to
danger, discuss it and do something about it.
 
WAMPUM #62
READING THE GREAT LAW
When the League of the Five Nations Council declares for a reading of the belts 
of shell to mind these laws, they shall provide for the reader a specially made 
mat woven of the fibers of wild hemp. The mat shall not be used again, for such 
formality is called “honoring the importance of the law.”
 
Note: The reading of the [[Great]] Law from the Wampum is very important and 
honorable. Some [[Indian]]s won’t read the [[Great]] Law in its written form because it 
says it should be recited every five years from the Wampum records. That’s the 
way it had to be done originally because there was no written language. Now that
there is a written language, Deganawida would have certainly recommended and 
urged that the people read the [[Great]] Law often. There are chiefs who don’t even 
know when they are violating the law because they refuse to read it in its 
written form.
 
WAMPUM #63
HOW THE GREAT LAW IS RECITED
Should two sons of opposite sides of the Council Fire agree (istawa) in a desire
to hear the reciting of the laws of the [[Great]] Peace and so refresh their 
memories in a way specified by the Founder of the League, they shall notify 
Atotarho. He shall consult with five of his cousin chiefs and they in turn shall
consult with their eight brethren. Then should they decide to accede to the 
request of the two sons from the opposite sides of the Council Fire, Atotarho 
shall send messengers to notify the chiefs of each of the Five Nations. Then 
they. shall dispatch their [[War]] Chief to notify their brother and cousin chiefs 
of the meeting and its time and place.
 
When all have come and have assembled, Atotarho, in conjunction with his cousin 
chiefs, shall appoint one chief who shall repeat the laws of the [[Great]] Peace to 
the two sons. Then the chosen one shall repeat the laws of the [[Great]] Peace.
 
Note: “Two sons of opposite sides of the Council Fire” means two ordinary men, 
non-chiefs who are members of different clans who sit opposite each other across
the Council Fire. Atotarho’s “five cousin chiefs” means those who sit opposite 
him in the Onondaga Council. “Their eight brethren” means brother Chiefs who sit
on the same side of the Council Fire. It would seem that the Wampum reader 
repeats, that is, reads the [[Great]] Law twice, once to the two sons and then to 
everybody.
 
WAMPUM #64
THE EXPERT SPEAKER/SINGER OF THE LAW AT THE INSTALLATION RITES
At the ceremony of the installation of chiefs, if there is only one expert 
speaker and singer of the Law and the Song of Peace to stand at the Council 
Fire, then when this speaker and singer has finished addressing one side of the 
Fire, he shall go to the opposite side and reply to his own speech and song. He 
shall act for both sides of the Fire until the entire ceremony has been 
completed. Such a speaker and singer shall be termed “Two-faced” because he 
speaks and sings for both sides of the Fire.
 
Note: People can become lax and negligent and suddenly find themselves without 
the right kind of speakers and singers.
 
WAMPUM #65
BURYING THE WEAPONS CEREMONY
I, Deganawida, and the [[United]] Chiefs, now uproot the tallest tree 
(skarenhesekowa) and into the hole thereby made, we case all weapons of war. 
Into the depths of the earth, down into the deep underneath currents of water 
(Tionswatetsien) flowing to unknown regions we cast all the weapons of strife. 
We bury them.from sight and we plant again the tree. Thus, shall the [[Great]] Peace
be established and hostilities shall no longer be known between the Five 
Nations, but peace to the [[United]] People.
 
Note: The Five Nations buried their weapons of war so they’ll never fight and 
[[kill]] each other again and they haven’t. They only unbury the war club to execute
a [[traitor]]. However, they did not bury the hatchet to all their enemies for they 
fought numerous wars and [[battle]]s after the Iroquois Confederacy was founded and 
the [[Great]] Law was established.
 
ADOPTIONS
 
WAMPUM #66
“A NAME HUNG ABOUT THE NECK”
The father of a [[child]] of great comeliness, learning, ability or specially loved 
because of some circumstance may, at the will of the [[child]]’s Clan, select a name
from his own (the father’s) Clan and bestow it by ceremony, such as is provided.
The naming is only temporary and shall be called, “A name hung about the neck
 
Note: A given name can be only temporary.
 
WAMPUM #67
GIVING A NAME TO A PERSON OF ANOTHER CLAN OR A FOREIGN NATION
Should any person, a member of the League of the Five Nations, especially esteem
a man or a woman of another Clan or of a foreign nation, he may choose a name, 
bestow it upon that person so esteemed. The naming shall be in accord with the 
ceremony of bestowing names. Such a name is only temporary and shall be called, 
“A name hung about the neck”. A short string of shells shall be delivered with 
the name as a record and a pledge.
 
Note: This type of name giving is more serious as a string wampum and a pledge 
are involved.
 
WAMPUM #68
ASKING TO BE ADOPTED INTO A CLAN
Should any member of the Five Nations, a family or a person belonging to a 
foreign nation submit a proposal for adoption into a clan or one of the Five 
Nations, he or she shall furnish a string of shells, a span in length, as a 
pledge to the Clan into which he or they wish to be adopted. The Chiefs of the 
Nation shall then consider the proposal and submit a decision.
 
Note: Adoption is how the Clans are kept at full strength.
 
WAMPUM #69 FOR ONE TO ADOPT A PERSON, A FAMILY OR A NUMBER OF FAMILIES
Any member of the Five Nations, who through esteem or other feelings, wishes to 
adopt an individual, a family, or a number of families, may offer adoption to 
him or them, and if accepted, the matter shall be brought to the attention of 
the Chiefs for confirmation and the Chiefs must confirm the adoption.
 
Note: Anyone may adopt a person or many persons but must get official sanction 
by the Rotiyaner in Council.
 
WAMPUM #70
WHAT TO DO AFTER ADOPTION
When the adoption of anyone shall have been confirmed by the Chiefs of the 
Nation, the chiefs shall address the people of the Nation and say:
“Now you of our Nation, be informed that, … (such a person, such a family, or 
such families), have ceased forever to bear their birth nation’s name and have 
buried it in the depth of the earth. Henceforth let no one of our Nation ever 
mention the original name or nation of their birth. To do so will hasten the end
of our peace.”
 
Note: The name of the adopted person’s nation or birthplace must never be 
mentioned as it causes trouble or end of the peace.
 
EMIGRATION
 
WAMPUM #71
ABOUT EMIGRATING TO A DISTANT REGION
When a person or family belonging to the Five Nations desires to abandon their 
Nation and the territory of the Five Nations they shall inform the chiefs of 
their Nation and the Council of the League of Five Nations shall take notice of 
it.
 
When a person or any of the people of the Five Nations emigrate and reside in a 
distant region away from the territory of the League of Five Nations, the chiefs
of the Five Nations at will may send a messenger carrying a broad belt of black 
shells and when the messenger arrives, he shall call the people together or 
address them personally, displaying the belt of black shells and they shall know
that this is an order for them to return to their original homes and to their 
Council Fires.
 
Note: The Rotiyaner may or may not recall an emigrant depending on the 
circumstances.
 
LAND TITLE
 
WAMPUM #72
LAW OF OWNERSHIP
The soil of the earth from one end to the other is the [[property]] of people who 
inhabit it. By birthright, the Onkwehonwe, the original beings, are the owners 
of the soil which they own and occupy and non other may hold it. The same law 
has been held from the oldest times.
 
Note: The Onkwehonwe legal opinion is that the natives of [[America]] were the first
humans on this land. The originated in the land they live on and occupy and no 
foreigners have the right to take over the land. The so-called “conquest of 
[[America]]” is simply a bare-faced robbery of [[Indian]] land.
 
WAMPUM #73
PEOPLE MADE DIFFERENT, PUT IN DIFFERENT LANDS AND SPEAK DIFFERENT LANGUAGES
The [[Great]] Creator has made us of one blood and of the same soil he made us, and 
as only different tongues constitute different nations, he established different
hunting grounds and territories and made boundary lines between them.
 
Note: Each nation has a boundary line to stay within. Also no race of people has
a “God given” right to invade other races.
 
FOREIGNERS
 
WAMPUM #74
ALIEN NATIONS ADMITTED ON A TEMPORARY BA[[SIS]]
When any alien nation of individual is admitted into the League, the admission 
shall be understood only to be a temporary one. Should the person or nation 
create loss or do wrong, cause suffering of any kind to endanger the peace of 
the League, the League statesmen shall order one of their [[War]] Chiefs to 
reprimand him or them. If a similar offense is committee, the offending party 
shall be expelled from the League.
 
WAMPUM #75
ALIEN REFUGES SEEKING PERMANENT RESIDENCE
When a member of an alien nation comes to the territory of the League and seeks 
refuge and permanent residence, the [[States]]man of the Nation to which he comes 
shall extend hospitality and make him a member of the Nation. Then he shall be 
accorded equal rights and privileges in all matters except as mentioned here.
 
WAMPUM #76
TEMPORARY ADOPTIONS
No body of alien people who have been adopted temporarily shall have a vote in 
the Council of the Chiefs of the League, for only they who have been invested 
with chieftainship titles may vote in the Council. Aliens have nothing by blood 
to make claim to a vote and should they have it, not knowing all the traditions 
of the League, might go against the [[Great]] Peace. In this manner, the [[Great]] Peace
would be endangered and perhaps be destroyed.
 
Note: The word “vote” is used here to mean “voice” as there is no voting or 
balloting in the National or Grand Councils of the Five Nations. Only the 
Rotiyaner have a voice in the Councils unless an individual is asked to speak by
the Rotiyaner.
 
WAMPUM #77
THE TEMPORARY ADOPTED MAY ALSO BE EXPELLED
When the chiefs of the League decide to admit a foreign nation and an adoption 
is made, the chiefs shall inform the adopted nation that its admission is only 
temporary. They shall also say to the nation that it must never try to control; 
interfere with, or injure the Five Nations, nor disregard the [[Great]] Peace or any
of its rules or customs. In no way should they cause disturbance or injury. Then
shall the adopted nation disregard these injunctions, their adoption will be 
annulled and they will be expelled.
 
The expulsion shall be in the following manner. The Council shall appoint one of
their [[War]] Chiefs to convey the message of annulment and he shall say:
“You,… (naming the nation), Listen to me while I speak. I am here to inform you 
again of the will of the Five Nations Council. It was clearly made known to you 
at a former time. Now. the chiefs of the Five Nations have decided to expel you 
and cast you out. We disown you now and annul your adoption. Therefore you must 
look for a path in which to go and lead away all your people. It was you, not 
we, who committed wrong and caused this sentence of annulment., -So then go your
way and depart from the territory of the Five Nations and away from the League.”
Note: The Tuscaroras were admitted into the Iroquois Confederacy in [[1714]] and 
given apiece of Oneida territory. It was too close to [[white]] settlements and they
asked for land further away and were given land in Seneca territory. They are 
not a foreign [[Indian]] nation. They had found their way back to their own people. 
A different situation would exist if an alien [[Indian]] nation living in their own 
territory asked to join the Iroquois Confederacy which was the original plan of 
Deganawida, to have all [[Indian]] nations unite in one big [[alliance]]. They never got
beyond Five Nations. The Tuscaroras were not given a voice in the Grand Council 
and all other [[Indian]] nations seeking admission were given protectorate [[Indian]] 
nation status with no voice nor power in the Confederacy. This is not what 
Deganawida had in mind. Had his plan been followed, there would now be a mighty 
Iroquois Confederacy of more than 200 nations with a country of its own. The 
missionaries take the credit for this failure to create a pan [[America]]n 
Confederacy. They say they went all over [[America]] to all [[Indian]] nations and 
spread propaganda against the Iroquois Confederacy, especially against the 
[[Mohawk]]s whom they consider the most militant and most able organizers. Actually,
it was the elitist Five Nations Chiefs who are responsible for the weakness of 
the Confederacy today.
 
WAMPUM #78
FOREIGN NATIONS URGED TO ACCEPT THE GREAT PEACE
Whenever a foreign nation enters the League or accepts the [[Great]] Peace, the Five
Nations and the foreign nation shall enter into an agreement and compact by 
which the foreign nation shall endeavor to persuade the other nations to accept 
the [[Great]] Peace.
 
Note: They asked other nations to help spread peace among mankind.
 
WAR
 
WAMPUM #79
ABOUT WAR AND HAVING THE MEN READY (WARRIOR SOCIETY)
Skanawati shall be vested with a double office, duty and double authority.: One 
half of his being shall hold the statesman title and the other half shall hold 
the title of [[War]] Chief. In the event of war, he shall notify the five [[War]] Chiefs
of the League and command them to prepare for war and have the men ready at the 
appointed time and place for engagement with the enemy of the [[Great]] Peace.
 
Note: At the time the Confederacy was formed, all chiefs were war chiefs and 
this included Skanawati, Tekarihoken, etc. After the new order of things, the 
[[War]] Chiefs became apart of the National and Grand Council until they died and 
afterwards, the [[War]] Chiefs became a separate entity.
 
WAMPUM #80
ESTABLISHING THE GREAT PEACE ON AN OUTSIDE NATION BY FORCE
When the Council of the League has for its object the establishment of the [[Great]]
Peace among the people of an outside nation and that nation refuses to accept 
the [[Great]] Peace, then by such refusal they bring a declaration of war upon 
themselves from the Five Nations. Then shall the Five Nations seek to establish 
the [[Great]] Peace by a conquest of the rebellious nation.
 
Note: There have been times when people were made good by force. No doubt the 
rebellious nation was acting aggressively.
 
WAMPUM #81
THE MEN OF THE LEAGUE (WARRIOR SOCIETY) CHOOSE WHICH OF THE WAR CHIEFS TO LEAD 
THEM IN BATTLE
When the men of the League, now called forth to become [[warrior]]s, are ready for 
[[battle]] with an obstinate opposing nation that has refused to accept the [[Great]] 
Peace, then one of the five [[War]] Chiefs shall be chosen by the [[warrior]]s of the 
League to lead the army into [[battle]]. It shall be the duty of the [[War]] Chief so 
chosen to come before his [[warrior]]s and address them. His aim shall be to impress
upon them the necessity of good behavior and strict obedience to the commands of
the [[War]] Chiefs.
 
He shall deliver an oration exhorting them with great zeal to be brave and 
courageous and never to be guilty of cowardice. At the conclusion of his 
oration, he shall march forward and commence a [[War]] Song and he shall sing:
 
Now I am greatly surprised
And therefore I shall use it
The power of my [[War]] Song
I am of the Five Nations,
And I shall make an appeal
To the Mighty Creator
He has furnished this army
My [[warrior]]s shall be mighty
In the strength of the Creator
Between him and my song they are
For it was he who gave the song
This war song that I sing.
Note: The [[warrior]]s choose the [[War]] Chief and they also choose which of the [[War]] 
Chiefs to lead them in the war.
 
WAMPUM #82
HOW THE WAR PARTY APPROACHES THE ENEMY
When the [[warrior]]s of the Five Nations are on an expedition against the enemy, 
the [[War]] Chief shall sing the [[War]] Song as he approaches the country of the enemy 
and not cease until his scouts have reported that the army is near the enemy 
lines when the [[War]] Chief shall approach with great caution and prepare for the 
attack.
 
Note: An [[Indian]] war is not all work and no play. There is entertainment before 
the action and after.
 
WAMPUM #83
AFTER THE WAR
When peace shall have been established by the termination of the war against a 
foreign nation, then the [[War]] Chief shall cause all the weapons of war to be 
taken from the nation. Then shall the [[Great]] Peace be established and that nation
shall observe all the rules of the [[Great]] Peace for all time to come.
 
WAMPUM #84
THE CONQUERED NATIONS MAY CONTINUE THEIR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT
Whenever a foreign nation has been [[conquer]]ed or has by their own will accepted 
the [[Great]] Peace, their own system of internal [[government]] may continue, but they 
must cease all [[warfare]] against other nations.
 
Note: All wars must cease! If necessary by force.
 
WAMPUM #85
WHEN AN OBSTINATE ENEMY IS EXTERMINATED
Whenever a war against a foreign nation is pushed until the nation is about 
exterminated because of its refusal to accept the [[Great]] Peace and if that nation
shall by its obstinacy become exterminated, all their rights, [[property]] and 
territory shall become the [[property]] of the Five Nations.
 
Note: This is what happens when a nation fights to the [[death]] of all.
 
WAMPUM #86
A SYMBOLIC RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED
Whenever a foreign nation is [[conquer]]ed and the survivors are brought into the 
territory of the League of Five Nations and placed under the [[Great]] Peace, the 
two shall be known as the Conqueror and the Conquered. A symbolic relationship 
shall be devised and be placed in some symbolic position. The [[conquer]]ed nation 
shall have no voice in the councils of the League in the body of chiefs.
 
WAMPUM #87
TERMS OF PEACE
When the war of the Five Nations on a foreign rebellious nation is ended, peace 
shall be restored to that nation by a withdrawal of all their weapons of war by 
the [[War]] Chief of the Five Nations. When all the terms of peace shall have been 
agreed upon, a state of friendship shall be established.
 
Note: After the war, the enemies shall become friends.
 
WAMPUM #88
THE GREAT PEACE URGED ON FOREIGN NATIONS BY PERSUASION OR BY FORCE
When the proposition to establish the [[Great]] Peace is made to a foreign nation, 
it shall be done in mutual council. The foreign nation is to be persuaded by 
reason and urged to come into the [[Great]] Peace. If the Five Nations fail to get 
the consent of the nation at the first council, a second council shall be held 
and upon a second failure; a third council shall be held and this third council 
shall end the peaceful methods of persuasion. At the third council, the [[War]] 
Chief of the Five Nations shall address the chief of the foreign nation and 
request him three times to accept the [[Great]] Peace. If refusal steadfastly 
follows, the [[War]] Chief shall let the bunch of [[white]] lake shells drop from his 
outstretched hand to the ground and shall bound quickly forward and club, the 
offending chief to [[death]]. [[War]] shall thereby be declared and the [[War]] Chief shall 
have his [[warrior]]s to back any emergency. [[War]] must continue until the contest is 
won by the Five Nations.
 
WAMPUM #89
A PEACE CHIEF ON DIPLOMATIC M[[[[ISS]]I]]ON ACCOMPANIED BY WARRIORS
When the chiefs of the Five Nations propose to meet in conference with a foreign
nation with proposals for an acceptance of the [[Great]] Peace, a large band of 
[[War]]riors shall conceal themselves in a secure place safe from the espionage of 
the foreign nation, but as near at hand as possible. Two [[warrior]]s shall 
ac[[company]] the Union Chief who. carries the proposals, and these [[warrior]]s shall 
be especially cunning. Should the chief be attacked, these [[warrior]]s shall hasten
back to the army of [[warrior]]s with the news of the calamity which fell through 
the treachery of the foreign nation.
 
WAMPUM #90
A PEACE CHIEF MUST RENOUNCE HIS TITLE TO GO TO WAR
When the Five Nations Council declares war, any chief of the League may enlist 
with the [[warrior]]s by temporarily renouncing his sacred chieftainship title which
he holds through the nomination of his women relatives. The title then reverts 
to them and they may bestow it upon another temporarily until the war is over, 
when the chief, if living, may resume his title and seat in the council.
 
Note: The Royaner turned [[warrior]] cannot exert any authority in the field of 
action and must take orders from the [[War]] Chief like any other [[warrior]].
 
WAMPUM #91
A WAMPUM BELT OF BLACK BEADS IS THE EMBLEM OF THE FIVE WAR CHIEFS
A certain wampum belt of black beads shall be the emblem of the authority of the
five [[War]] Chiefs to take up the weapons of war and with their men to resist 
invasion. This shall be called a [[War]] in the Defense of the Territory.
 
WAMPUM #92
IF A PART OF A NATION, A WHOLE NATION OR MORE THAN A NATION ENDEAVOR TO DESTROY 
THE GREAT PEACE BY VIOLATING THE LAWS, THEY SHALL BE DRIVEN FROM THE TERRITORY 
BY THE WAR CHIEF AND HIS MEN (WARRIOR SOCIETY)
If a nation, part of a nation, or more than one nation within the Five Nations 
should in any way endeavor to destroy the [[Great]] Peace by neglect or violating 
its laws and resolve to dissolve the League, such a nation or nations shall be 
deemed guilty of [[treason]] and called enemies of the League and the [[Great]] Peace.
 
It shall then be the duty of the chiefs of the League who remain faithful to 
resolve to warn the offending people. They shall be warned once and if a second 
warning is necessary, they shall be driven from the territory of the League by 
the [[War]] Chief and his men.

WAMPUM #93
THE REFERENDUM THE PEOPLE DECIDE ON THE MOST IMPORTANT MATTERS

League Council and the nature of the matter effects the entire body of Five 
Nations, threatening their utter ruin, then the chiefs of the League must submit
the matter to the decision of their people and the decision of the people shall 
affect the decision of the League Council. This decision shall be a confirmation
of the voice of the people.

THE MEN OF EVERY CLAN SHALL HOLD A COUNCIL OF THE CLAN AND THEIR DECISION SHALL 
BE CONSIDERED BY THE COUNCIL OF CHIEFS
The men of every Clan of the Five Nations shall have a Council Fire ever burning
in readiness for a Council of the clan. When it seems necessary for the interest

others of their number. When their council shall have come to a conclusion on 
any matter, their decision shall be reported to the Council of the Nation of the
League Council (as the case may require) by the [[War]] Chief or the [[War]] Chiefs.

has to go along with their decision as the Confederacy is a people’s [[government]].
 
WAMPUM #97
ORIGINAL NATIONAL COUNCIL FIRES SHALL CONTINUE
Before the real people united their nations, each nation had its own Council 
Fires. Before the [[Great]] Peace. their councils were held. The Five Council Fires

Conferring of Chief titles in an improper way, through their [[War]] Chief, they may
demand that such actions become subject to correction, and that the matter 
conform to the ways of presented by the law of the [[Great]] Peace.
 
Note: The “nephew” and “niece” means ordinary men and women who are not 
Rotiyaner or Clan Mothers, showing that every one has the right to correct any 
wrong being done. The [[Great]] Peace and the [[Great]] Law seem to be interchangeable. 
Each is a product of the other.
 
WAMPUM #99
THE CEREMONIES TO CONTINUE
The rites and festivals of each nation shall remain undisturbed and continue as 
before, because they were given by the people of old times as useful and 
necessary for the good of men.

FUNERALS
 
WAMPUM #108
OF A CHIEF
At the funeral of a chief of the League, these words are said:
 
“Now we become reconciled as you start away. You were once a Chief of the League
of Five Nations, and the united people trusted you. Now we release you, for it 
is true that it is no longer possible for us to walk about together on the 
earth. Now, therefore, we lay it (the body) here. Here we lay it away. Now then 
we say to you, persevere onward to the place where the Creator dwells in peace. 
Let not the things of the earth hinder you. Let nothing that transpired while 
you lived hinder you. In hunting, you once delighted; in the game of lacrosse, 
you once took delight, and in the feast and pleasant occasions, your mind was 
amused, but now do not allow thoughts of these things to give you trouble.”
“Let not your relatives hinder you and also let not your friends and associates 
trouble your mind. Regard none of these things.”
“Now then, in turn, you here present who are related to the man, and you who 
were his friends and associates, behold the path that is yours also! Soon we 
ourselves will be left in that place. For this reason, hold yourselves in 
restraint as you go from place to place. In your actions and in your 
conversation do no idle thing. Speak no idle talk, neither gossip. Be careful of
this and speak not and do not give away to evil behavior. One year is the time 
that you must abstain from unseeming levity, but if you cannot do this for 
ceremony, ten days is the time to regard these things for respect.”
Note: The Handsome Lake religion wanted to impose the one year period of 
mourning but according to the [[Great]] Law, a new Chief must be raised ten days 
after the [[death]] of a Royaner when the Condolence Ceremony is performed and a new
Royaner is raised and the ten days of mourning is lifted according to the [[Great]] 
Law.
 
There is a small condolence within three days of the [[death]] of a chief, which is 
temporary until a full condolence is held with a candidate selected by the clan.

you for it is true that it is no longer possible for us to walk about together 
on the earth. Now, therefore, we lay it (the body) here. Here we lay it away. 
Now we say to you, persevere onward to the place where the Creator dwells in 
peace. Let not the things of the earth hinder you. Looking after your family was
a sacred duty, and you were faithful. You were one of the joint heirs of the 
chieftainship titles. Feastings were yours and you had pleasant occasions…” (The
remainder is the same as the address at the funeral of a chief)
 
WAMPUM #113
OF A WOMAN
At the funeral of a woman of the people, say:
 
“Now we become reconciled as you start away. You were once a women in the flower

while you lived hinder you.” (The remainder is the same as at the funeral of a 
chief.)

once more and rekindle their fires in peace, to put their house in order and

black clouds shall roll away and that the blue sky is visible once more. 
Therefore, they shall be at peace in the sunshine again.
 
WAMPUM #117
SPEAKING AT THE BURIAL AND AT THE TENTH DAY OF MOURNING
Three strings of shell one span in length shall be employed in addressing the 
assemblage at the- burial of the dead. The speaker shall say:
 
“Hearken you who are here, this body is to be covered. Assemble in this place 
again in ten days hence, for it is the decree of the Creator that mourning shall
cease when ten days have expired. Then a feast shall be made.”
Then at the expiration of ten days, the Speaker shall say:
 
“Continue to listen you who are here. The ten days of mourning have expired and 
your mind must now be freed of sorrow as before the loss of your relative. The 
relatives have decided to make a little compensation to those who have assisted 
at the funeral. It is a mere expression of thanks. This is the one who did the 
cooking while the body was lying in the house. Let her come forward and receive 
this gift and be released from this task.” (In substance, this will be repeated 
for everyone who assisted in any way until all have been remembered.)
 
 
So ends the words of the [[Great]] Law of Peace
passed down by Deganawida
