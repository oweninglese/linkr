Sharon McIvor has won yet another landmark legal victory for First Nations women
– this time at the [[United]] Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC). On [[January]] 14,
[[2019]], the UNHRC released their decision which found that [[Canada]] still 
discriminates against "[[Indian]]" women and their descendants in the registration 
provisions of the [[Indian]] Act. Despite the fact that Sharon had already proven 
her discrimination case at trial and on appeal here in [[Canada]], the federal 
[[government]] refused to eliminate all the remaining sex discrimination from the 
Act. This meant that Sharon and her descendants still have lesser or no [[Indian]] 
status as compared to her brother and his descendants – simply based on sex. 
Sharon was therefore forced to bring a human rights claim to the UNHRC under the
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR). The UNHRC found [[Canada]] had violated Sharon’s human rights and directed 
[[Canada]] to provide an effective remedy for Sharon McIvor, her descendants, and 
others who have suffered the same discrimination.
 
 
It is important to note that [[Canada]] is bound by this decision. The ICCPR came 
into force for [[Canada]] on [[August]] 19, [[1976]] and [[Canada]] has agreed to be bound by 
the jurisdiction of the UNHRC to make decisions on matters coming before it. 
This means that [[Canada]] has chosen to be bound by the rights contained within 
this Covenant for the benefits of all those in [[Canada]]. In this case, the UNHRC 
found that [[Canada]] had violated Sharon’s human rights under articles 3 and 26, 
read in conjunction with article 27 of the ICCPR. 
 
 
Article 3 guarantees the equal right of men and women to enjoy the rights 
contained in the ICCPR. Article 26 provides that all people are equal under the 
law and specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, sex, birth 
or other status. These two articles were considered in conjunction with article 
27 which provides that ethnic minorities within [[States]] shall not be denied their
right to enjoy their culture in community with other members of their group. The
UNHRC found that [[Canada]] had violated Sharon’s rights under all three articles 
and directed [[Canada]] to do make “full reparation” to Sharon, her descendants and 
others in her position. [[Canada]] was directed to: 
 
 
(1) Register all those like Sharon and her descendants, under section 6(1)(a) of
the [[Indian]] Act;
 
 
(2) Take steps to clean up any residual discrimination within First Nation 
communities arising from sex discrimination in the [[Indian]] Act; and
 
 
(3) Take any additional steps necessary to avoid similar violations in the 
future.
 
 
The federal [[government]] has been given a 180 days to inform the UNHRC about how 
it will implement this decision. The good news is that the federal [[government]] 
has the capacity to comply with the first part of the decision this month. The 
federal [[government]] already drafted amendments to the [[Indian]] Act’s registration 
provisions in Bill S-3 that would remove the remaining sex discrimination raised
by Sharon McIvor’s case. The problem is that Parliament didn’t enact those 
provisions into force. While all the other amendments contained within Bill 
S-3were brought into force in [[2018]], they purposely left our remedy for sex 
equality for “someday” – a hypothetical right that we can only hope is fulfilled
someday. First Nations women deserve better than this.
 
 
While the [[Indian]] Act’s registration provisions have a long, complicated [[history]],
and the various amendments made over time, including Bills C-31, C-3 and the 
most recent S-3 have created a complex mess of criteria almost impossible to 
understand; the core issue is simple. [[Indian]] women who married non-[[Indian]]s and 
their descendants have lesser or no status compared to [[Indian]] men who married 
non-[[Indian]]s and their descendants. Sex discrimination in federal legislation, 
like the [[Indian]] Act, is against [[Canadian]] law as well as international human 
rights laws to which [[Canada]] has agreed to be bound. There is simply no legal 
justification for continuing to deny the basic right of sex equality to First 
Nation women and [[child]]ren. To do so makes the federal [[government]] an outlaw – 
both in [[Canada]] and internationally.
 
 
The question now is whether the self-professed “feminist” Prime Minister Justin 
[[[[Trudeau]]]] and his Liberal [[government]] will abide by the UNHRC decision or continue 
to violate the core human rights of First Nations women and [[child]]ren. 
Reconciliation with First Nations demands immediate implementation of this 
decision, but the Liberal (and Conservative) record is very poor when it comes 
to respecting the human rights of First Nations women. They have the power to do
it – but it always has been, and always will be, a matter of political will. 
 
 
Sharon has sacrificed more than 33 years to this [[battle]] to protect the rights of
First Nation women and our [[child]]ren. It is because of Sharon that I have a 
political voice as a First Nations woman. Implementing this decision will not 
only mean that my [[child]]ren will finally be able to be registered and included as
members of my First Nation, but Sharon and I, and thousands of others like us, 
will finally be treated equally with our First Nation brothers.
 
 
[[Canada]] cannot claim to stand as a champion of human rights in the global context
while continuing to deny First Nations women and [[child]]ren basic human rights. 
Reconciliation requires shedding the hypocritical rhetoric and taking action to 
do what is morally right and legally required.
 
 
The world is watching [[Canada]].
