### Foreword

Sometime in the late [[1950]]s, that world-class gossip and occasional historian,  
John F. [[Kennedy]], told me how, in [[1948]], Harry S. Truman had been pretty much  
abandoned by everyone when he came to run for president. Then an [[America]]n  
Zionist brought him two million dollars in cash, in a suitcase, aboard his whistle-stop  
campaign train. 'That's why our recognition of [[Israel]] was rushed through so fast.' As  
neither Jack nor I was an antisemite (unlike his father and my grandfather) we took  
this to be just another funny story about Truman and the serene corruption of  
[[America]]n politics.

Unfortunately, the hurried recognition of [[Israel]] as a state has resulted in forty-  
five years of murderous confusion, and the destruction of what Zionist fellow  
travellers thought would be a pluralistic state - home to its native population of  
Muslims, Christians and Jews, as well as a future home to peaceful [[Europe]]an and  
[[America]]n Jewish immigrants, even the ones who affected to believe that the great  
realtor in the sky had given them, in perpetuity, the lands of Judea and Sameria.  
Since many of the immigrants were good socialists in [[Europe]], we assumed that they  
would not allow the new state to become a theocracy, and that the native Palestinians  
could live with them as equals. This was not meant to be. I shall not rehearse the wars  
and alarms of that unhappy region. But I will say that the hasty invention of [[Israel]]  
has poisoned the political and intellectual life of the [[USA]], [[Israel]]'s unlikely patron.

Unlikely, because no other minority in [[America]]n [[history]] has ever hijacked so  
much money from the [[America]]n taxpayers in order to invest in a 'homeland'. It is as  
if the [[America]]n taxpayer had been obliged to support the [[Pope]] in his reconquest of  
the Papal [[States]] simply because one third of our people are [[Roma]]n Catholic. Had this  
been attempted, there would have been a great uproar and [[Congress]] would have said  
no. But a religious minority of less than two per cent has bought or intimidated  
seventy senators (the necessary two thirds to overcome an unlikely presidential veto)  
while enjoying support of the media.

In a sense, I rather admire the way that the [[Israel]] lobby has gone about its  
business of seeing that billions of dollars, year after year, go to make [[Israel]] a 'bulwark  
against communism'. Actually, neither the USSR nor communism was ever much of a  
presence in the region. What [[America]] did manage to do was to

\[viii\] turn the once friendly Arab world against us. Meanwhile, the misinformation  
about what is going on in the Middle East has got even greater and the principal  
victim of these gaudy lies - the [[America]]n taxpayer to one side - is [[America]]n Jewry, as  
it is constantly bullied by such professional terrorists as Begin and Shamir. Worse,  
with a few honorable exceptions, Jewish-[[America]]n intellectuals abandoned

liberalism for a series of demented [[alliance]]s with the Christian (antisemtic) right and  
with the Pentagon-industrial complex. In [[1985]] one of them blithely wrote that when  
Jews arrived on the [[America]]n scene they 'found liberal opinion and liberal politicians  
more congenial in their attitudes, more sensitive to Jewish concerns' but now it is in  
the Jewish interest to ally with the Protestant funda[[mental]]ists because, after all, "is  
there any point in Jews hanging on dogmatically, hypocritically, to their opinions of  
yesteryear?' At this point the [[America]]n left split and those of us who criticised our  
onetime Jewish allies for misguided opportunism, were promptly rewarded with the  
ritual epithet 'antisemite' or 'self-hating Jew'.

Fortunately, the voice of reason is alive and well, and in [[Israel]], of all places.  
From Jerusalem, [[Israel]] Shahak never ceases to analyse not only the dismal politics of  
[[Israel]] today but the Talmud itself, and the effect of the entire rabbinical tradition on a  
small state that the right-wing rabbinate means to turn into a theocracy for Jews  
only. I have been reading Shahak for years. He has a satirist's eye for the confusions  
to be found in any religion that tries to rationalise the irrational. He has a scholar's  
sharp eye for textual contradictions. He is a joy to read on the great Gentile-hating Dr  
Maimonides.

Needless to say, [[Israel]]'s authorities deplore Shahak. But there is not much to be  
done with a retired professor of [[chemistry]] who was born in [[[[War]]saw]] in [[1933]] and  
spent his [[child]]hood in the concentration camp at Belsen. In [[1945]], he came to [[Israel]];  
served in the [[Israel]]i military; did not become a Marxist in the years when it was  
fashionable. He was - and still is - a humanist who detests imperialism whether in the  
names of the God of Abraham or of George [[Bush]]. Equally, he opposes with great wit  
and learning the totalitarian strain in Judaism. Like a highly learned Thomas Paine,  
Shahank illustrates the prospect before us, as well as the long [[history]] behind us, and  
thus he continues to reason, year after year. Those who heed him will certainly be  
wiser and - dare I say? - better. He is the latest, if not the last, of the great prophets.

    Chapter 1
    

#### A Closed Utopia?

    I write here what I think is true, for the stories of the Greeks are
    numerous and in my opinion ridiculous ;
    Hecateus of Miletis, as quoted by Herodotus.
    

    Amicus Plato sed magis amica veritas. — Plato is a friend but truth is
    a greater friend.
    Traditional paraphrase of a passage of Aristotele’s Ethics
    

    In a free state every man can think what he wants and say what he
    thinks
    Spinoza
    

THIS BOOK, although written in English and addressed to people living  
outside the State of [[Israel]], is, in a way, a continuation of my political activities as an  
[[Israel]]i Jew. Those activities began in [[1965]]-6 with a [[protest]] which caused a  
considerable scandal at the time: I had personally witnessed an ultra-religious Jew  
refuse to allow his phone to be used on the Sabbath in order to call an ambulance for  
a non-Jew who happened to have collapsed in his Jerusalem neighbourhood. Instead  
of simply publishing the incident in the press, I asked for a meeting which is  
composed of rabbis nominated by the State of [[Israel]]. I asked them whether such  
behavior was consistent with their interpretation of the Jewish religion. They  
answered that the Jew in question had behaved correctly, indeed piously, and backed  
their statement by referring me to a passage in an authoritative compendium of  
Talmudic laws, written in this century. I reported the incident to the main Hebrew  
daily, Ha'aretz, whose publication of the story caused a media scandal.

The results of the scandal were, for me, rather negative. Neither the [[Israel]]i, nor  
the diaspora, rabbinical authorities ever reversed their ruling that a Jew should not  
violate the Sabbath in order to save the life of a Gentile. They added much  
sanctimonious twaddle to the effect that if the consequence of such an act puts Jews  
in danger, the violation of the Sabbath is permitted, for their sake. It became  
apparent to me, as drawing on Talmudic laws governing the relations between Jews  
and non-Jews, that neither Zionism, including its seemingly secular part,

\[2\] nor [[Israel]]i politics since the inception of the State of [[Israel]], nor particularly the  
policies of the Jewish supporters of [[Israel]] in the diaspora, could be understood unless  
the deeper in[[flu]]ence of those laws, and the worldview which they both create and  
express is taken into account. The actual policies [[Israel]] pursued after the Six Day

[[War]], and in particular the apartheid character of the [[Israel]]i regime in the Occupied  
[[Territories]] and the attitude of the majority of Jews to the issue of the rights of the  
Palestinians, even in the abstract, have merely strengthened this conviction.

By making this statement I am not trying to ignore the political or strategic  
considerations which may have also in[[flu]]enced the rulers of [[Israel]]. I am merely  
saying that actual politics is an interaction between realistic considerations (whether  
valid or mistaken, moral or immoral in my view) and ideological in[[flu]]ences. The  
latter tend to be more in[[flu]]ential the less they are discussed and 'dragged into the  
light'. Any form of [[racism]], discrimination and xenophobia becomes more potent and  
politically in[[flu]]ential if it is taken for granted by the society which indulges in it. This  
is especially so if its discussion is prohibited, either formally or by tacit agreement.  
When [[racism]], discrimination and xenophobia is prevalent among Jews, and directed  
against non-Jews, being fueled by religious motivations, it is like its opposite case,  
that of antisemitism and its religious motivations. Today, however, while the second  
is being discussed, the very existence of the first is generally ignored, more outside  
[[Israel]] than within it.

Defining the Jewish State

Without a discussion of the prevalent Jewish attitudes to non-Jews, even the  
concept of [[Israel]] as 'a Jewish state', as [[Israel]] formally defines itself, cannot be  
understood. The widespread misconception that [[Israel]], even without considering its  
regime in the Occupied [[Territories]], is a true democracy arises from the refusal to  
confront the significance of the term 'a Jewish state' for non-Jews. In my view, [[Israel]]  
as a Jewish state constitutes a danger not only to itself and its inhabitants, but to all  
Jews and to all other peoples and states in the Middle East and beyond. I also  
consider that other Middle [[Eastern]] states or entities which define themselves as  
'Arab' or 'Muslim', like the [[Israel]]i self-definition as being 'Jewish', likewise constitute  
a danger. However, while this danger is widely discussed, the danger inherent in the  
Jewish character of the State of [[Israel]] is not.

###### \[3\]

The principle of [[Israel]] as 'a Jewish state' was supremely important to [[Israel]]i  
politicians from the inception of the state and was inculcated into the Jewish  
population by all conceivable ways. When, in the early [[1980]]s, a tiny minority of  
[[Israel]]i Jews emerged which opposed this concept, a Constitutional Law (that is, a law  
overriding provisions of other laws, which cannot be revoked except by a special  
procedure) was passed in [[1985]] by an enormous majority of the Knesset. By this law  
no party whose programme openly opposes the principle of 'a Jewish state' or  
proposes to change it by democratic means, is allowed to participate in the elections  
to the Knesset. I myself strongly oppose this constitutional principle. The legal  
consequence for me is that I cannot belong, in the state of which I am a citizen, to a  
party having principles with which I would agree and which is allowed to participate  
in Knesset elections. Even this example shows that the State of [[Israel]] is not a  
democracy due to the application of a Jewish ideology directed against all non-Jews  
and those Jews who oppose this ideology. But the danger which this dominant  
ideology represents is not limited to domestic affairs. It also in[[flu]]ences [[Israel]]i foreign  
policies. This danger will continue to grow, as long as two currently operating

developments are being strengthened: the increase in the Jewish character of [[Israel]]  
and the increase in its power, particularly in [[nuclear]] power. Another ominous factor  
is that [[Israel]]i in[[flu]]ence in the [[USA]] political establishment is also increasing. Hence  
accurate information about Judaism, and especially about the [[treatment]] of non-Jews  
by [[Israel]], is now not only important, but politically vital as well.

Let me begin with the official [[Israel]]i definition of the term 'Jewish', illustrating  
the crucial difference between [[Israel]] as 'a Jewish state' and the majority of other  
states. By this official definition, [[Israel]] 'belongs' to persons who are defined by the  
[[Israel]]i authorities as 'Jewish', irrespective of where they live, and to them alone. On  
the other hand, [[Israel]] doesn't officially 'belong' to its non-Jewish citizens, whose  
status is considered even officially as inferior. This means in practice that if members  
of a [[Peru]]vian tribe are converted to Judaism, and thus regarded as Jewish, they are  
entitled at once to become [[Israel]]i citizens and benefit from the approximately 70 per  
cent of the West Bank land (and the 92 per cent of the area of [[Israel]] proper), officially  
designated only for the benefit of Jews. All non-Jews ( not only all Palestinians) are  
prohibited from benefiting from those lands. (The prohibition applies even to [[Israel]]i  
Arabs who served in the [[Israel]]i army and reached a high rank.) The case involving  
[[Peru]]vian converts to Judaism actually occurred a few years ago. The newly-created  
Jews were settled in

\[4\] the West Bank, near Nablus, on land from which non-Jews are officially excluded.  
All [[Israel]]i [[government]]s are taking enormous political risks, including the risk of war,  
so that such settlements, composed exclusively of persons who are defined as 'Jewish'  
(and not '[[Israel]]i' as most of the media mendaciously claims) would be subject to only  
'Jewish' authority.

I suspect that the Jews of the [[USA]] or of Britian would regard it as antisemitic if  
Christians would propose that the [[USA]] or the [[United]] [[King]]dom should become a  
'Christian state', belonging only to citizens officially defined as 'Christians'. The  
consequence of such doctrine is that Jews converting to Christianity would become  
full citizens because of their conversion. It should be recalled that the benefits of  
conversions are well known to Jews from their own [[history]]. When the Christian and  
the Islamic states used to discriminate against all persons not belonging to the  
religion of the state, including the Jews, the discrimination against Jews was at once  
removed by their conversion. But a non-Jew discriminated against by the State of  
[[Israel]] will cease to be so treated the moment he or she converts to Judaism.This  
simply shows that the same kind of exclusivity that is regarded by a majority of the  
diaspora Jews as antisemitic is regarded by the majority of all Jews as Jewish. To  
oppose both antisemitism and Jewish chauvinism is widely regarded among Jews as  
a 'self-hatred', a concept which I regard as nonsensical.

The meaning of the term 'Jewish' and its cognates, including 'Judaism', thus  
becomes in the context of [[Israel]]i politics as important as the meaning of 'Islamic',  
when officially used by [[Iran]], or 'communist' when it was officially used by the USSR.  
However, the meaning of the term 'Jewish' as it is popularly used is not clear, either  
in Hebrew or when translated into other languages, and so the term had to be defined  
officially.

    According to [[Israel]]i law a person is considered 'Jewish' if either their mother,
    

grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother were Jewesses by  
religion; or if the person was converted to Judaism in a way satisfactory to the [[Israel]]i  
authorities, and on condition that the person has not converted from Judaism to  
another religion, in which case [[Israel]] ceases to regard them as 'Jewish'. Of the three  
conditions, the first represents the Talmudic definition of 'who is a Jew', a defintion  
followed by Jewish Orthodoxy. The Talmud and post-Talmudic rabbinic law also  
recognise the conversion of a non-Jew to Judaism (as well as the purchase of a non-  
Jewish slave by a Jew followed by a different kind of conversion) as a method of  
becoming Jewish, provided that the conversion is performed by authorised rabbis in  
a proper manner. This 'proper manner'

\[5\] entails for females, their inspection by three rabbis while naked in a 'bath of  
purification', a ritual which, although notorious to all readers of the Hebrew press, is  
not often mentioned by the English media in spite of its undoubted interest for  
certain readers. I hope that this book will be the beginning of a process which will  
rectify this discrepancy.

But there is another urgent necessity for an official definitionof who is, and who  
is not 'Jewish'. The State of [[Israel]] officially discriminates in favour of Jews and  
against non-Jews in many domains of life, of which I regard three as being most  
important: residency rights, the right to work and the right to equality before the law.  
Discrimination in residency is based on the fact that about 92 per cent of [[Israel]]'s land  
is the [[property]] of the state and is administered by the [[Israel]] Land Authority  
according to regulations issued by the Jewish National Fund (JNF), and affiliate of  
the World Zionist Organization. In its regualtions the JNFdenies the right to reside,  
to open a business, and often to work, to anyone who is not Jewish, only because he is  
not Jewish. At the same time, Jews are not prohibited from taking residence or  
opening businesses anywhere in [[Israel]]. If applied in another state against the Jews,  
such discriminatory practice would instantly and justifiably be labelled antisemitism  
and would no doubt spark massive public [[[[protest]]s]]. When applied by [[Israel]] as a part  
of its 'Jewish ideology', they are usually studiously ignored or excused when rarely  
mentioned.

The denial of the right to work means that non-Jews are prohibited officially  
from working on land administered by the [[Israel]] Land Authority according to the  
JNF regulations. No doubt these regulations are not always, or even often, enforced  
but they do exist. From time to time [[Israel]] attempts enforcement campaigns by state  
authorities, as, for example, when the Agriculture Ministry acts against 'the pestilence  
of letting fruit orchards belonging to Jews and situated on National Land \[i.e., land  
belonging to the State of [[Israel]]\] be harvested by Arab labourers', even if the labourers  
in question are citizens of [[Israel]]. [[Israel]] also strictly prohibits Jews settled on  
'National Land' to sub-rent even a part of their land to Arabs, even for a short time;  
and those who do so are punished, usually by heavy fines. There is no prohibitions on  
non-Jews renting their land to Jews. This means, in my own case, that by virtue of  
being a Jew I have the right to lease an orchard for harvesting its produce from  
another Jew, but a non-Jew, whether a citizen of [[Israel]] or a resident alien, does not  
have this right.

Non-Jewish citizens of [[Israel]] do not have the right to equality before the law.  
This discimination is expressed in many

\[6\] [[Israel]]i laws in which, presumably in order to avoid embarressment, the terms  
'Jewish' and 'non-Jewish' are usually not explicitly stated, as they are in the crucial  
Law of Return. According to that law only persons officially recognised as 'Jewish'  
have an automatic right of entry to [[Israel]] and of settling in it. They automatically  
receive an 'immigration certificate' which provides them on arrival with 'citizenship  
by virtue of having returned to the Jewish homeland', and with the right to many  
financial benefits, which vary somewhat according to the country from which they  
emmigrated. The Jews who emigrate from the states of the former UUSR receive 'an  
absorption grant' of more than $20,000 per family. All Jews immigrating to [[Israel]]  
accordingthis law immediately acquire the right to vote in elections and to be elected  
to the Knesset -- even if they do not speak a word of Hebrew.

Other [[Israel]]i laws substitute the more obtuse expressions 'anyone who can  
immigrate in accordance with the Law of Return' and 'anyone who is not entitled to  
immigrate in accordance with the law of Return'. Depending onthe law in questionm  
benefits are them grantedto the first category and systematically denied to the  
second. The routine means for enforcing discrimination in everyday life is the ID  
card, which everyone is obliged to carry at all times. ID cards list the official  
'nationality' of a person, which can be 'Jewish', 'Arab', 'Druze' and the like, witah the  
significant exception of '[[Israel]]i'. Attempts to force the Interior Minister to allow  
[[Israel]]is wishing to be officially described as '[[Israel]]i', or even as '[[Israel]]i-Jew' in their  
ID cards have failed. Those who have attempted to do so have a letter from the  
Ministry of the Interior stating that 'it was decided not to recognise an [[Israel]]i  
nationality'. The letter does not specify who made this decision or when.

There are so many laws and regulations in [[Israel]] which discriminate in favour of  
the persons defined in [[Israel]] as those 'who can immigrate in accordance with the Law  
of Return' that the subject demands seperate [[treatment]]. We can look here at one  
example, seemingly trivial in comparison with residence restrictions, but  
nevertheless important since it reveals the real intentions of the [[Israel]]i legislator.  
[[Israel]]i citizens who left the country for a time but who are defined as those who 'can  
immigrate in accordance with the Law of Return' are eligible on their return to  
generous customs benefits, to receive subsidy for their [[child]]ren's high school  
education, and to receive either a grant or a loan on easy terms for the purchase of an  
apartment, as well as other benefits. Citizens who cannot be so defined, in other  
words, the non-Jewish citizens of [[Israel]], get none of these benefits. The obvious  
intention of such discriminatory measures

\[7\] is to decrease the number of non-Jewish citizens of [[Israel]], in order to make [[Israel]]  
a more 'Jewish' state.

The Ideology of 'Redeemed' Land

[[Israel]] also propagates among its Jewish citizens an exclusivist ideology of the  
Redemption of Land. Its official aim of minimizing the number of non-Jews can be  
well perceived in this ideology , which is inculcated to Jewish school[[child]]ren in [[Israel]].  
They are taught that it is applicable to the entire extent of either the State of [[Israel]] or,  
after [[1967]], to what is referred to as the Land of [[Israel]]. According to this ideology, the  
land which has been 'redeemed' is the land which has passed from non-Jewish  
ownership to Jewish ownership. The ownership can be either private, or belong to

either the JNF or the Jewish state. The land which belongs to non-Jews is, on the  
contrary, considered to be 'unredeemed'. Thus, if a Jew who committed the blackest  
crimes which can be imagined buys a piece of land from a virtuous non-Jew, the  
'unredeemed' land becomes 'redeemed' by such a transaction. However, if a virtuous  
non-Jew purchases land from the worst Jew, the formerly pure and 'redeemed' land  
becomes 'unredeemed' again. The logical conclusion of such an ideology is the  
expulsion, called 'transfer', of all non-Jews from the area of land which has to be  
'redeemed'. Therefore the Utopia of the 'Jewish ideology' adopted by the State of  
[[Israel]] is a land which is wholly 'redeemed' and none of it is owned or worked by non-  
Jews. The leaders of the Zionist labour movement expressed this utterly repellent  
idea with the greatest clarity. Walter Laquer a devoted Zionist, tells in his History of  
Zionism (1) how one of these spiritual fathers, A.D. Gordon, who died in [[1919]],  
'objected to [[violence]] in principle and justified self defence only in extreme  
circumstances. But he and his friends wanted every tree and bush in the Jewish  
homeland to be planted by nobody else except Jewish pioneers'. This means that they  
wanted everybody else to just go away and leave the land to be 'redeemed' by Jews.  
Gordon's successors added more [[violence]] than he intended but the principle of  
'redemption' and its consequences have remained.

In the same way, the kibbutz, widely hailed as an attempt to create a Utopia,  
was and is an exclusivist Utopia; even if it is composed of atheists, it does not accent  
Arab members on principle and demands that potential members from other  
nationalities be first converted to Judaism. No wonder the kibbutz boys can be  
regarded as the most militaristic segment of the [[Israel]]i jewish society.

    It is this exclusivist ideology, rather than all the 'security
    

\[8\] needs' alleged by [[Israel]]i propaganda, which determines the takeovers of land in  
[[Israel]] in the [[1950]]s and again in the mid-[[1960]]s and in the Occupied [[Territories]] after

[[1967]].  This ideology also dictated official [[Israel]]i plans for 'the Judaizition of Galilee'.  
    This curious term means encouraging Jews to settle in Galilee by giving them  
    financial benefits. (I wonder what would be the reaction of US Jews if a plan for 'the  
    Christianization of [[New]] York' or even only of Brooklyn, would be proposed in their  
    country.) But the Redemption of the Land implies more than regional 'Judaization'.  
    In the entire area of [[Israel]] the JNF, vigorously backed by [[Israel]]i state agencies  
    (especially by the secret police) is spending great sums of public money in order to  
    'redeem' any land which non-Jews are willing to sell, and to preempt any attempt by a  
    Jew to sell his land to a non-Jew by paying him a higher price.

[[Israel]]i Expansionism

The main danger which [[Israel]], as 'a Jewish state', poses to its own people, to  
other Jews and to its neighbors, is its ideologically motivated pursuit of territorial  
expansion and the inevitable series of wars resulting from this aim. The more [[Israel]]  
becomes Jewish or, as one says in Hebrew, the more it 'returns to Judaism' (a process  
which has been under way in [[Israel]] at least since [[1967]]), the more its actual politics  
are guided by Jewish ideological considerations and less by rational ones. My use of  
the term 'rational' does not refer here to a moral evaluation of [[Israel]]i policies, or to  
the supposed defence or security needs of [[Israel]] - even less so to the supposed needs  
of '[[Israel]]i survival'. I am referring here to [[Israel]]i imperial policies based on its

presumed interests. However morally bad or politically crass such policies are, I  
regard the adoption of policies based on 'Jewish ideology', in all its different versions  
as being even worse. The ideological defence of [[Israel]]i policies are usually based on  
Jewish religious beliefs or, in the case of secular Jews, on the 'historical rights' of the  
Jews which derive from those beliefs and retain the dogmatic character of religious  
faith.

My own early political conversion from admirer of Ben-Gurion to his dedicated  
opponent began exactly with such an issue. In [[1956]] I eagerly swallowed all of Ben-  
Gurion's political and military reasons for [[Israel]] initiating the Suez [[War]], until he (in  
spite of being an atheist, proud of his disregard of the commandments of Jewish  
religion) pronounced in the Knesset on the third day of that war, that the real reason  
for it is 'the restoration of the kingdom of David and Solomon' to its Biblical borders.  
At this point in his speech, almost every Knesset

\[9\] member spontaneously rose and sang the [[Israel]]i national anthem. To my  
knowledge, no zionist politician has ever repudiated Ben-Gurion's idea that [[Israel]]i  
policies must be based (within the limits of pragmatic considerations) on the  
restoration of the Biblical borders as the borders of the Jewish state. Indeed, close  
analysis of [[Israel]]i grand strategies and actual principles of foreign policy, as they are  
expressed in Hebrew, makes it clear that it is 'Jewish ideology', more than any other  
factor, which determines actual [[Israel]]i policies. The disregard of Judaism as it really  
is and of 'Jewish ideology' makes those policies incomprehensible to foreign  
observers who usually know nothing about Judaism exept crude apologetics.

Let me give a more recent illustration of the essential difference which exists  
between [[Israel]]i imperial planning of the most inflated but secular type, and the  
principles of 'Jewish ideology'. The latter enjoins that land which was either ruled by  
any Jewish ruler in ancient times or was promised by God to the Jews, either in the  
Bible or - what is actually more important politically - according to a rabbinic  
interpretation of the Bible and the Talmud, should belong to [[Israel]] since it is a Jewish  
state. No doubt, many Jewish 'doves' are of the opinion that such conquest should be  
deferred to a time when [[Israel]] will be stronger than it is now, or that there would be,  
hopefully, a 'peaceful conquest', that is , that the Arab rulers or peoples would be  
'persuaded' to cede the land in question in return for benefits which the Jewish state  
would then confer on them.

A number of discrepant versions of Biblical borders of the Land of [[Israel]], which  
rabbinical authorities interpret as ideally belonging to the Jewish state, are in  
circulation. The most far-reaching among them include the following areas within  
these borders: in the south, all of Sinai and a part of nothern [[Egypt]] up to the environs  
of Cairo; in the east, all of Jordan and a large chunk of [[Saudi]] [[Arabia]], all of Kuwait and  
a part of Iraq south of the Euphrates; in the north, all of [[Lebanon]] and all of Syria  
together with a huge part of [[Turkey]] (up to lake Van); and in the west, Cyprus. An  
enormous body of [[research]] and learned discussion based on these borders, embodied  
in atlases, books, articles and more popular forms of propaganda is being published  
in [[Israel]], often with state subsidies, or other forms of support. Certainly the late  
Kahane and his followers, as will as in[[flu]]ential bodies such as Gush Emunim, not only  
desire the conquest of those territories by [[Israel]], but regard it as a divinely  
commanded act, sure to be successful since it will be aided by God. In fact, important

Jewish religious figures regard the [[Israel]]i refusal to undertake such a holy war, or  
even

\[10\] worse, the return of Sinai to [[Egypt]], as a national sin which was justly punished  
by God. One of the more in[[flu]]ential Gush Emunim rabbis, Dov Lior, the rabbi of  
Jewish settlements of Kiryat Arba and of Hebron, stated repeatedly that the [[Israel]]i  
failure to [[conquer]] [[Lebanon]] in [[1982]]-5 was a well-merited divine punishment for its  
sin of 'giving a part of Land of [[Israel]]', namely Sinai, to [[Egypt]].

Although I have chosen an admittedly extreme example of the Biblical borders  
of the Land of [[Israel]] which 'belong' to the 'Jewish state', those borders are quite  
popular in national-religious circles. There are less extreme versions of Biblical  
borders, sometimes also called 'historical borders'. It should however be emphasized  
that within [[Israel]] and the community of its diaspora Jewish supporters, the validity  
of the concept of either Biblical borders or historical borders as delineating the  
bordrers of land which belongs to Jews by right is not denied on grounds of principle,  
except by the tiny minority which opposes the concept of a Jewish state. Otherwise,  
objections to the realisation of such borders by a war are purely pragmatical. One can  
claim that [[Israel]] is now too weak to [[conquer]] all the land which 'belongs' to the Jews,  
or that the loss of Jewish lives (but not of Arab lives!) entailed in a war of conquest of  
such magnitude is more important than the conquest of the land, but in normative  
Judaism one cannot claim that 'the Land of [[Israel]]', in whatever borders, does not  
'belong' to all the Jews. In [[May]] [[1993]], Ariel Sharon formally proposed in the Likud  
Convention that [[Israel]] should adopt the 'Biblical borders' concept as its official policy.  
There were rather few objections to this proposal, either in the Likud or outside it,  
and all were cased on pragmaic grounds. No one even asked Sharon where exactly are  
the Biblical borders which he was urging that [[Israel]] should attain. Let us recall that  
among those who call themselves Leninists there was no doubt that [[history]] follows  
the principles laid out by Marx and Lenin. It is not only the belief itself, however  
dogmatic, but the refusal that it should ever be doubted, by thwarting open  
discussion, which creates a totalitarian cast of mind. [[Israel]]i-Jewish society and  
diaspora Jews who are leading 'Jewish lives' and organised in purely Jewish  
organisations, can be said therefore to have a strong streak of totalitarianism in their  
character.

However, an [[Israel]]i grand strategy, not based on the tenets of 'Jewish ideology',  
but based on purely strategic or imperial considerations had also developed since the  
inception of the state. An authoriative and lucid description of the principles  
governing such strategy was given by General (Reserves) Shlomo Gazit, a former  
Military Intelligence commander. (2) According to Gazit,

###### \[11\]

    "[[Israel]]'s main task has not changed at all [since the demise of the USSR] and it
    remains of crucial importance. The geographical location of [[Israel]] at the centre of
    the Arab-Muslim Middle East predestines [[Israel]] to be a devoted guardian of stability
    in all the countries surrounding it. Its [role] is to protect the existing regimes: to
    prevent or halt the processes of radicalization, and to block the expansion of
    funda[[mental]]ist religious zealtory.
    

    For this purpose [[Israel]] will prevent changes occuring beyond [[Israel]]'s borders
    

    [which it] will regard as intolerable, to the point of feeling compelled to use all its
    military power for the sake of their prevention or eradication."
    

In other words, [[Israel]] aims at imposing a hegemony on other Middle [[Eastern]]  
states. Needless to say, according to Gazit, [[Israel]] has a benevolent concern for the  
stability of the Arab regimes. In Gazit's view, by protecting Middle [[Eastern]] regimes,  
[[Israel]] performs a vital service for 'the industrially advanced states, all of which are  
keenly concerned with guaranteeing the stability in the Middle East'. He argues that  
without [[Israel]] the existing regimes of the region would have collapsed long ago and  
that they remain in existence only because of [[Israel]]i threats. While this view may be  
hypocritical, one should recall in such contexts La Rochefoucault's maxim that  
'hypocrisy is the tax which wickedness pays to virtue'. Redemption of the Land is an  
attempt to evade paying any such tax.

Needless to say, I also oppose root and branch the [[Israel]]i non-ideological  
policies as they are so lucidly and correctly explained by Gazit. At the same time, I  
recognize that the dangers of the policies of Ben-Gurion of Sharon, motivated by  
'Jewish ideology', are much worse than merely imperial policies, however criminal.  
The results of policies of other ideologically motivated regimes point in the same  
direction. The existence of an important component of [[Israel]]i policy, which is based  
on 'Jewish ideology', makes its analysis politically imperative. This ideology is, in turn  
based on the attitudes of historic Judaism to non-Jews, one of the main themes of  
this book. Those attitudes necessarily in[[flu]]ence many Jews, consciously or  
unconciously. Our task here is to discuss historic Judaism in real terms.

The in[[flu]]ence on 'Jewish ideology' on many Jews will be stronger the more it is  
hidden from public discussion. Such discussion will, it is hoped, lead people take the  
same attitude towards Jewish chauvinism and the contempt displayed by so many  
Jews towards non-Jews (which will be documented below) as that commonly taken  
towards antisemitism and all other forms of xenophobia, chauvinism and [[racism]]. It is  
justly

\[12\] assumed that only the full exposition, not only of antisemitism, but also of its  
historical roots, can be the basis of struggle against it. Likewise I am assuming that  
only the full exposition of Jewish chauvinism and religious fanaticism can be the  
basis of struggle against those phenomena. This is especially true today when,  
contrary to the situation prevailing fifty or sixty years ago, the political in[[flu]]ence of  
Jewish chauvinism and religious fanaticism is much greater than that of  
antisemitism. But there is also another important consideration. I strongly believe  
that antisemitism and Jewish chauvinism can only be fought simultaneously.

A Closed Utopia?

Until such attitudes are widely adopted, the actual danger of [[Israel]]i policies  
based on 'Jewish ideology' remains greater than the danger of policies based on  
purely strategic considerations. The difference between the two kinds of policies was  
well expressed by Hugh Trevor-Roper in his essay Sir Thomas More and Utopia (3)  
in which he termed them Platonic and Machiavellian:

    "Machiavelli at least apologized for the methods which he thought necessary in
    

    politics. He regretted the necessity of force and fraud and did not call them by any
    other name. But Plato and More sanctified them, provided that they were used to
    sustain their own Utopian republics."
    

In a similiar way true believers in that Utopia called the 'Jewish state', which  
will strive to achieve the 'Biblical borders', are more dangerous than the grand  
strategists of Gazit's type because their policies are being sanctified either by the use  
of religion or, worse, by the use of secularized religious principles which retaim  
absolute validity. While Gazit at least sees a need to argue that the [[Israel]] diktat  
benefits the Arab regimes, Ben-Gurion did not pretend that the re-establishment of  
the kingdom of David and Solomon will benefit anybody except the Jewish state.

Using the concepts of Platonism to analyse [[Israel]]i policies based on 'Jewish  
ideology' should not seem strange. It was noticed by several scholars, of whom the  
most important was Moses Hadas, who claimed that the foundations of 'classical  
Judaism', that is, of Judaism as it was established by talmudic sages, are based on  
Platonic in[[flu]]ences and especially on the image of Sparta as it appears in Plato. (4)  
According to Hadas, a crucial feature of the Platonic political system, adopted by  
Judaism as early as the Maccabean period (142-63 BC), was 'that every phase of  
human conduct be subject to religious sanctions which are in fact to be manipulated  
by the ruler'.

\[13\] There can be no better definition of 'classical Judaism' and of the ways in which  
the rabbis manipulated it than this Platonic definition. In particular, Hadas claims  
that Judaism adopted what 'Plato himself summarized \[as\] the objectives of his  
program', in the following well-known passage:

    "The principle thing is that no one, man or woman, should ever be without an
    officer set over him, and that none should get the [[mental]] habit of taking any step,
    whether in earnest or in jest, on his individual responsibility. In peace as in war he
    must live always with his eyes on his superior officer... In a word, we must train the
    mind not to even consider acting as an invidual or know how to do it." (Laws, 942ab)
    

If the word 'rabbi' is substituted for 'an officer' we will have a perfect image of  
classical Judaism. The latter is still deeply in[[flu]]encing [[Israel]]i-Jewish society and  
determing to a large extent the [[Israel]]i policies.

It was the above quoted passage which was chosen by Karl Popper in The Open  
Society and Its Enemies as describing the essence of 'a closed society'. Historical  
Judaism and its two successors, Jewish Orthodoxy and Zionism, are both sworn  
enemies of the concept of the open society as applied to [[Israel]]. A Jewish state,  
whether based on its present Jewish ideology or, if it becomes even more Jewish in  
character than it is now, on the principles of Jewish Orthodoxy, cannot ever contain  
an open society. There are two choices which face [[Israel]]i-Jewish society. It can  
become a fully closed and warlike ghetto, a Jewish Sparta, supported by the labour of  
Arab helots, kept in existence by its in[[flu]]ence on the US political establishment and  
by threats to use its [[nuclear]] power, or it can try to become an open society. The  
second choice is dependent on an honest examination of its Jewish past, on the

admission that Jewish chauvinism and exclusivism exist, and on an honest  
examination of the attitudes of Judaism towards the non-Jews.

    Chapter 2
    

#### Prejudice and Prevarication

The first difficulty in writing about this subject is that the term 'Jew' has been  
used during the last 150 years with two rather different meanings. To understand  
this, let us imagine ourselves in the year [[1780]]. Then the universally accepted meaning  
of the term 'Jew' basically coincided with what the Jews themselves understood as  
constituting their own identity. This identity was primarily religious, but the precepts  
of religion governed the details of daily behavior in all aspects of life, both social and  
private, among the Jews themselves as well as in their relation to non-Jews. It was  
then literally true that a Jew could not even drink a glass of water in the home of a  
non-Jew. And the same basic laws of behavior towards non-Jews were equally valid  
from Yemen to [[New]] York. Whatever the term by which the Jews of [[1780]] may be  
described - and I do not wish to enter into a metaphysical dispute about terms like,  
'nation' and 'people' (1) - it is clear that all Jewish communities at that time were  
separate from the non-Jewish societies in the midst of which they were living.

However, all this was changed by two parallel processes - beginning in Holland  
and England, continuing in [[revolution]]ary [[France]] and in countries which followed the  
example of the [[French]] Revolution, and then in the modern monarchies of the 19th  
century: the Jews gained a significant level of individual rights (in some cases full  
legal equality), and the legal power of the Jewish community over its members was  
destroyed. It should be noted that both developments were simultaneous, and that  
the latter is even more important, albeit less widely known, than the former.

Since the time of the late [[Roma]]n Empire, Jewish communities had considerable  
legal powers over their members. Not only powers which arise through voluntary  
mobilization of social pressure (for example refusal to have any dealing whatsoever  
with an excommunicated Jew or even to bury his body), but a power of naked  
coercion: to flog, to im[[prison]], to expel - all this could be inflicted quite legally on an  
individual Jew by the rabbinical courts for all kinds of offenses. In many countries -  
[[Spain]] and [[Poland]] are notable examples - even capital punishment could be and was  
inflicted, sometimes using particularly cruel methods such as flogging to [[death]]. All  
this was not only

\[15\] permitted but positively encouraged by the state authorities in both Christian  
and Muslim countries, who besides their general interest in preserving 'law and  
order' had in some cases a more direct financial interest as well. For example, in  
[[Spanish]] archives dating from the 13th and 14th centuries there are records of many  
detailed orders issued by those most devout Catholic [[King]]s of Castile and Aragon,  
instructing their no less devout officials to co-operate with the rabbis in enforcing  
observance of the Sabbath by the Jews. Why? Because whenever a Jew was fined by a  
rabbinical court for violating the Sabbath, the rabbis had to hand nine tenths of the  
fine over to the king - a very profitable and effective arrangement. Similarly, one can  
quote from the responsa written shortly before [[1832]] by the famous Rabbi Moshe  
Sofer of Pressburg (now Bratislava), in what was then the autonomous Hungarian  
[[King]]dom in the [[Austria]]n Empire, and addressed to Vienna in [[Austria]] proper, where  
the Jews had already been granted some considerable individual rights. (2) He  
laments the fact that since the Jewish congregation in Vienna lost its powers to  
punish offenders, the Jews there have become lax in matters of religious observance,

and adds: 'Here in Pressburg, when I am told that a Jewish shopkeeper dared to open  
his shop during the Lesser Holidays, I immediately send a policeman to im[[prison]]  
him.'

This was the most important social fact of Jewish existence before the advent of  
the modern state: observance of the religious laws of Judaism, as well as their  
inculcation through education, were enforced on Jews by physical coercion, from  
which one could only escape by conversion to the religion of the majority, amounting  
in the circumstances to a total social break and for that reason very impracticable,  
except during a religious crisis. (3)

However, once the modern state had come into existence, the Jewish  
community lost its powers to punish or intimidate the individual Jew. The bonds of  
one of the most closed of 'closed societies', one of the most totalitarian societies in the  
whole [[history]] of mankind were snapped. This act of [[liberation]] came mostly from  
outside; although there were some Jews who helped it from within, these were at first  
very few. This form of [[liberation]] had very grave consequences for the future. Just as  
in the case of Germany (according to the masterly analysis of A.J.P. Taylor) it was  
easy to ally the cause of reaction with patriotism, because in actual fact individual  
rights and equality before the law were brought into Germany by the armies of the  
[[French]] Revolution and of Napoleon, and one could brand [[liberty]] as 'un-German',  
exactly so it turned out to be very easy among the Jews, particularly in [[Israel]], to  
mount a very effective

\[16\] attack against all the notions and ideals of humanism and the rule of law (not to  
say democracy) as something 'un-Jewish' or 'anti-Jewish' - as indeed they are, in a  
historical sense - and as principles which may be used in the 'Jewish interest', but  
which have no validity against the 'Jewish interest', for example when Arabs invoke  
these same principles. This has also led - again just as in Germany and other nations  
of Mitteleuropa - to a deceitful, senti[[mental]] and ultra-romantic Jewish  
historiography, from which all inconvenient facts have been expunged.

So one will not find in Hannah Arendt's voluminous writings, whether on  
totalitarianism or on Jews, or on both, (4) the smallest hint as to what Jewish society  
in Germany was really like in the 18th century: burning of books, persecution of  
writers, disputes about the magic powers of amulets, bans on the most elementary  
'non-Jewish' education such as the teaching of correct German or indeed German  
written in the Latin alphabet. Nor can one find in the numerous English-language  
'Jewish histories' the elementary facts about the attitude of Jewish mysticism (so  
fashionable at present in certain quarters) to non-Jews: that they are considered to  
be, literally, limbs of Satan, and that the few non-satanic individuals among them  
(that is, those who convert to Judaism) are in reality 'Jewish souls' who got lost when  
Satan violated the Holy Lady (Shekhinah or Matronit, one of the female components  
of the Godhead, sister and wife of the younger male God according to the cabbala) in  
her heavenly abode. The great authorities, such as Gershom Scholem, have lent their  
authority to a system of deceptions in all the 'sensitive' areas, the more popular ones  
being the most dishonest and misleading.

But the social consequence of this process of liberalization was that, for the first  
time since about AD 200, (6) a Jew could be free to do what he liked, within the

bounds of his country's civil law, without having to pay for this freedom by converting  
to another religion. The freedom to learn and read books in modern languages, the  
freedom to read and write books in Hebrew not approved by the rabbis (as any  
Hebrew or Yiddish book previously had to be), the freedom to eat non-kosher food,  
the freedom to ignore the numerous absurd taboos regulating sexual life, even the  
freedom to think - for 'forbidden thoughts' are among the most serious sins - all these  
were granted to the Jews of [[Europe]] (and subsequently of other countries) by modern  
or even absolutist [[Europe]]an regimes, although the latter were at the same time  
antisemitic and oppressive. Nicholas I of [[Russia]] was a notorious antisemite and  
issued many laws against the Jews of his state. But he also strengthened the forces of  
'law and order' in

\[17\] [[Russia]] - not only the secret police but also the regular police and the  
gendarmerie - with the consequence that it became difficult to murder Jews on the  
order of their rabbis, whereas in pre-[[1795]] [[Poland]] it had been quite easy. 'Official'  
Jewish [[history]] condemns him on both counts. For example, in the late [[1830]]s a 'Holy  
Rabbi' (Tzadik) in a small Jewish town in the [[Ukraine]] ordered the murder of a  
heretic by throwing him into the boiling water of the town baths, and contemporary  
Jewish sources note with astonishment and horror that bribery was 'no longer  
effective' and that not only the actual perpetrators but also the Holy Man were  
severely punished. The Metternich regime of pre-[[1848]] [[Austria]] was notoriously  
reactionary and quite unfriendly to Jews, but it did not allow people, even liberal  
Jewish rabbis, to be poisoned. During [[1848]], when the regime's power was  
temporarily weakened, the first thing the leaders of the Jewish community in the  
Galician city of Lemberg (now Lvov) did with their newly regained freedom was to  
poison the liberal rabbi of the city, whom the tiny non-Orthodox Jewish group in the  
city had imported from Germany. One of his greatest heresies, by the way, was the  
advocacy and actual performance of the Bar Mitzvah ceremony, which had recently  
been invented.

Liberation from Outside

In the last 150 years, the term 'Jew' has therefore acquired a dual meaning, to  
the great confusion of some well-meaning people, particularly in the English-  
speaking countries, who imagine that the Jews they meet socially are '[[representative]]'  
of Jews 'in general'. In the countries of east [[Europe]] as well as in the Arab world, the  
Jews were liberated from the tyranny of their own religion and of their own  
communities by outside forces, too late and in circumstances too unfavorable for  
genuine internalized social change. In most cases, and particularly in [[Israel]], the old  
concept of society, the same ideology - especially as directed towards non-Jews - and  
the same utterly false conception of [[history]] have been preserved. This applies even to  
some of those Jews who joined 'progressive' or leftist movements. An examination of  
radical, socialist and communist parties can provide many examples of disguised  
Jewish chauvinists and racists, who joined these parties merely for reasons of 'Jewish  
interest' and are, in [[Israel]], in favor of 'anti-Gentile' discrimination. One need only  
check how many Jewish 'socialists' have managed to write about the kibbutz without  
taking the trouble to mention that it is a racist institution from which non-Jewish  
citizens of [[Israel]] are rigorously excluded, to see that

\[18\] the phenomenon we are alluding to is by no means uncommon. (7)

Avoiding labels based on ignorance or hypocrisy, we thus see that the word  
'Jewry' and its cognates describe two different and even contrasting social  
groups, and because of current [[Israel]]i politics the continuum between the two is  
disappearing fast. On the one hand there is the traditional totalitarian meaning  
discussed above; on the other hand there are Jews by descent who have internalized  
the complex of ideas which Karl Popper has called 'the open society'. (There are also  
some, particularly in the [[USA]], who have not internalized these ideas, but try to make  
a show of acceptance.)

It is important to note that all the supposedly 'Jewish characteristics' - by which  
I mean the traits which vulgar so-called intellectuals in the West attribute to 'the  
Jews' - are modern characteristics, quite unknown during most of Jewish [[history]], and  
appeared only when the totalitarian Jewish community began to lose its power. Take,  
for example, the famous Jewish sense of humor. Not only is humor very rare in  
Hebrew literature before the 19th century (and is only found during few periods, in  
countries where the Jewish upper class was relatively free from the rabbinical yoke,  
such as [[Italy]] between the 14th and 17th centuries or Muslim [[Spain]]) but humor and  
jokes are strictly forbidden by the Jewish religion - except, significantly, jokes against  
other religions. Satire against rabbis and leaders of the community was never  
internalized by Judaism, not even to a small extent, as it was in Latin Christianity.  
There were no Jewish comedies, just as there were no comedies in Sparta, and for a  
similar reason. (8) Or take the love of learning. Except for a purely religious learning,  
which was itself in a debased and degenerate state, the Jews of [[Europe]] (and to a  
somewhat lesser extent also of the Arab countries) were dominated, before about  
[[1780]], by a supreme contempt and hate for all learning (excluding the Talmud and  
Jewish mysticism). Large parts of the Old Testament, all nonliturgical Hebrew  
poetry, most books on Jewish philosophy were not read and their very names were  
often anathematized. Study of all languages was strictly forbidden, as was the study of  
mathematics and [[[[science]]]]. Geography, (9) [[history]] - even Jewish [[history]] - were  
completely unknown. The critical sense, which is supposedly so characteristic of  
Jews, was totally absent, and nothing was so forbidden, feared and therefore  
persecuted as the most modest innovation or the most innocent criticism.

It was a world sunk in the most abject superstition, fanaticism and ignorance, a  
world in which the preface to the first

\[19\] work on geography in Hebrew (published in [[1803]] in [[Russia]]) could complain that  
very many great rabbis were denying the existence of the [[America]]n continent and  
saying that it is 'impossible'. Between that world and what is often taken in the West  
to 'characterize' Jews there is nothing in common except the mistaken name.

However, a great many present-day Jews are nostalgic for that world, their lost  
paradise, the comfortable closed society from which they were not so much liberated  
as expelled. A large part of the Zionist movement always wanted to restore it - and  
this part has gained the upper hand. Many of the motives behind [[Israel]]i politics,  
which so bewilder the poor confused western 'friends of [[Israel]]', are perfectly  
explicable once they are seen simply as reaction, reaction in the political sense which  
this word has had for the last two hundred years: a forced and in many respects  
innovative, and therefore illusory, return to the closed society of the Jewish past.

Obstacles to Understanding

Historically it can be shown that a closed society is not interested in a  
description of itself, no doubt because any description is in part a form of critical  
analysis and so may encourage critical 'forbidden thoughts'. The more a society  
becomes open, the more it is interested in reflecting, at first descriptively and then  
critically, upon itself, its present working as well as its past. But what happens when a  
faction of intellectuals desires to drag a society, which has already opened up to a  
considerable extent, back to its previous totalitarian, closed condition? Then the very  
means of the former progress - philosophy, the [[[[science]]]]s, [[history]] and especially  
sociology - become the most effective instruments of the '[[treason]] of the intellectuals'.  
They are perverted in order to serve as devices of deception, and in the process they  
degenerate.

Classical Judaism (10) had little interest in describing or explaining itself to the  
members of its own community, whether educated (in talmudic studies) or not. (11) It  
is significant that the writing of Jewish [[history]], even in the driest annalistic style,  
ceased completely from the time of Josephus Flavius (end of first century) until the  
Renaissance, when it was revived for a short time in [[Italy]] and in other countries  
where the Jews were under strong [[Italian]] in[[flu]]ence. (12) Characteristically, the rabbis  
feared Jewish even more than general [[history]], and the first modern book on [[history]]  
published in Hebrew (in the 16th century) was entitled History of the [[King]]s of  
[[France]] and of the Ottoman [[King]]s. It was followed by some histories dealing only  
with the persecutions that

\[20\] Jews had been subjected to. The first book on Jewish [[history]] proper (13)  
(dealing with ancient times) was promptly banned and suppressed by the highest  
rabbinical authorities, and did not reappear before the 19th century. The rabbinical  
authorities of east [[Europe]] furthermore decreed that all non-talmudic studies are to  
be forbidden, even when nothing specific could be found in them which merits  
anathema, because they encroach on the time that should be employed either in  
studying the Talmud or in making money - which should be used to subsidize  
talmudic scholars. Only one loophole was left, namely the time that even a pious Jew  
must perforce spend in the privy. In that unclean place sacred studies are forbidden,  
and it was therefore permitted to read [[history]] there, provided it was written in  
Hebrew and was completely secular, which in effect meant that it must be exclusively  
devoted to non-Jewish subjects. (One can imagine that those few Jews of that time  
who - no doubt tempted by Satan - developed an interest in the [[history]] of the [[French]]  
kings were constantly complaining to their neighbors about the constipation they  
were suffering from ...) As a consequence, two hundred years ago the vast majority of  
Jews were totally in the dark not only about the existence of [[America]] but also about  
Jewish [[history]] and Jewry's contemporary state; and they were quite content to  
remain so.

A Totalitarian History

There was however one area in which they were not allowed to remain self-  
contented - the area of Christian attacks against those passages in the Talmud and  
the talmudic literature which are specifically anti-Christian or more generally anti-  
Gentile. It is important to note that this challenge developed relatively late in the

[[history]] of Christian-Jewish relations - only from the 13th century on. (Before that  
time, the Christian authorities attacked Judaism using either Biblical or general  
arguments, but seemed to be quite ignorant as to the contents of the Talmud.) The  
Christian campaign against the Talmud was apparently brought on by the conversion  
to Christianity of Jews who were well versed in the Talmud and who were in many  
cases attracted by the development of Christian philosophy, with its strong  
Aristotelian (and thus universal) character. (14)

It must be admitted at the outset that the Talmud and the talmudic literature -  
quite apart from the general anti-Gentile streak that runs through them, which will be  
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 - contain very offensive statements and  
precepts directed specifically against Christianity. For example, in addition to a series  
of scurrilous sexual allegations

\[21\] against Jesus, the Talmud states that his punishment in hell is to be immersed in  
boiling excrement - a statement not exactly calculated to endear the Talmud to  
devout Christians. Or one can quote the precept according to which Jews are  
instructed to burn, publicly if possible, any copy of the [[New]] Testament that comes  
into their hands. (This is not only still in force but actually practiced today; thus on  
23 [[March]] [[1980]] hundreds of copies of the [[New]] Testament were publicly and  
ceremonially burnt in Jerusalem under the auspices of Yad Le'akhim, a Jewish  
religious organization subsidized by the [[Israel]]i Ministry of Religions.)

Anyway, a powerful attack, well based in many points, against talmudic Judaism  
developed in [[Europe]] from the 13th century. We are not referring here to ignorant  
calumnies, such as the blood libel, propagated by benighted monks in small  
provincial cities, but to serious disputations held before the best [[Europe]]an  
universities of the time and on the whole conducted as fairly as was possible under  
medieval circumstances. (15)

What was the Jewish - or rather the rabbinical - response? The simplest one was  
the ancient weapon of bribery and string-pulling. In most [[Europe]]an countries, during  
most of the time, anything could be fixed by a bribe. Nowhere was this maxim more  
true than in the Rome of the Renaissance popes. The Editio Princeps of the complete  
Code of Talmudic Law, Maimonides' Mishneh Torah - replete not only with the most  
offensive precepts against all Gentiles but also with explicit attacks on Christianity  
and on Jesus (after whose name the author adds piously, '[[May]] the name of the  
wicked perish') - was published unexpurgated in Rome in the year 1480 under Sixtus  
IV, politically a very active pope who had a constant and urgent need for money. (A  
few years earlier, the only older edition of The Golden Ass by Apuleius from which the  
violent attack on Christianity had not been removed was also published in Rome.)  
Alexander VI Borgia was also very liberal in this respect.

Even during that period, as well as before it, there were always countries in  
which for a time a wave of anti-Talmud persecution set in. But a more consistent and  
widespread onslaught came with the Reformation and Counter Reformation, which  
induced a higher standard of intellectual honesty as well as a better knowledge of  
Hebrew among Christian scholars. From the 16th century, all the talmudic literature,  
including the Talmud itself, was subjected to Christian censorship in various  
countries. In [[Russia]] this went on until [[1917]]. Some censors, such as in Holland, were

more lax, while others were more severe; and the offensive passages were expunged  
or modified.

###### \[22\]

All modern studies on Judaism, particularly by Jews, have evolved from that  
conflict, and to this day they bear the unmistakable marks of their origin: deception,  
apologetics or hostile polemics, indifference or even active hostility to the pursuit of  
truth. Almost all the so-called Jewish studies in Judaism, from that time to this very  
day, are polemics against an external enemy rather than an internal debate.

It is important to note that this was initially the character of historiography in  
all known societies (except ancient [[Greece]], whose early liberal historians were  
attacked by later sophists for their insufficient patriotism!). This was true of the early  
Catholic and Protestant historians, who polemicized against each other. Similarly, the  
earliest [[Europe]]an national histories are imbued with the crudest nationalism and  
s[[corn]] for all other, neighboring nations. But sooner or later there comes a time when  
an attempt is made to understand one's national or religious adversary and at the  
same time to criticize certain deep and important aspects of the [[history]] of one's own  
group; and both these developments go together. Only when historiography becomes

+   as Pieter Geyl put it so well - 'a debate without end' rather than a continuation of  
    war by historiographic means, only then does a humane historiography, which strives  
    for both accuracy and fairness, become possible; and it then turns into one of the  
    most powerful instruments of humanism and self-education.

It is for this reason that modern totalitarian regimes rewrite [[history]] or punish  
historians. (16) When a whole society tries to return to totalitarianism, a totalitarian  
[[history]] is written, not because of compulsion from above but under pressure from  
below, which is much more effective. This is what happened in Jewish [[history]], and  
this constitutes the first obstacle we have to surmount.

Defense Mechanisms

What were the detailed mechanisms (other than bribery) employed by Jewish  
communities, in cooperation with outside forces, in order to ward off the attack on  
the Talmud and other religious literature? Several methods can be distinguished, all  
of them having important political consequences reflected in current [[Israel]]i policies.  
Although it would be tedious to supply in each case the Beginistic or Labour-zionist  
parallel, I am sure that readers who are somewhat familiar with the details of Middle  
East politics will themselves be able to notice the resemblance.

The first mechanism I shall discuss is that of surreptitious defiance,  
combined with outward compliance. As explained

\[23\] above, talmudic passages directed against Christianity or against non-Jews (17)  
had to go or to be modified - the pressure was too strong. This is what was done: a  
few of the most offensive passages were bodily removed from all editions printed in  
[[Europe]] after the mid-16th century. In all other passages, the expressions 'Gentile',  
'non-Jew', 'stranger' (goy, eino yehudi, nokhri) - which appear in all early

manuscripts and printings as well as in all editions published in Islamic countries -  
were replaced by terms such as 'idolator', 'heathen' or even 'Canaanite' or 'Samaritan',  
terms which could be explained away but which a Jewish reader could recognize as  
euphemisms for the old expressions.

As the attack mounted, so the defence became more elaborate, sometimes with  
lasting tragic results. During certain periods the Tsarist [[Russia]]n censorship became  
stricter and, seeing the above mentioned euphemisms for what they were, forbade  
them too. Thereupon the rabbinical authorities substituted the terms 'Arab' or  
'Muslim' (in Hebrew, Yishma'eli - which means both) or occasionally '[[Egypt]]ian',  
correctly calculating that the Tsarist authorities would not object to this kind of  
abuse. At the same time, lists of Talmudic Omissions were circulated in manuscript  
form, which explained all the new terms and pointed out all the omissions. At times, a  
general disclaimer was printed before the title page of each volume of talmudic  
literature, solemnly declaring, sometimes on oath, that all hostile expressions in that  
volume are intended only against the idolators of antiquity, or even against the long-  
vanished Canaanites, rather than against 'the peoples in whose land we live'. After the  
[[British]] conquest of India, some rabbis hit on the subterfuge of claiming that any  
particularly outrageous derogatory expression used by them is only intended against  
the [[Indian]]s. Occasionally the aborigines of [[Australia]] were also added as whipping-  
boys.

Needless to say, all this was a calculated lie from beginning to end; and  
following the establishment of the State of [[Israel]], once the rabbis felt secure, all the  
offensive passages and expressions were restored without hesitation in all new  
editions. (Because of the enormous cost which a new edition involves, a considerable  
part of the talmudic literature, including the Talmud itself, is still being reprinted  
from the old editions. For this reason, the above mentioned Talmudic Omissions  
have now been published in [[Israel]] in a cheap printed edition, under the title  
Hesronot Shas.) So now one can read quite freely - and Jewish [[child]]ren are actually  
taught - passages such as that (18) which commands every Jew, whenever passing  
near a cemetery, to utter a blessing if the cemetery is Jewish, but to curse the

\[24\] mothers of the dead (19) if it is non-Jewish. In the old editions the curse was  
omitted, or one of the euphemisms was substituted for 'Gentiles'. But in the new  
[[Israel]]i edition of Rabbi Adin Steinsalz (complete with Hebrew explanations and  
glosses to the Aramaic parts of the text, so that school[[child]]ren should be in no doubt  
as to what they are supposed to say) the unambiguous words 'Gentiles' and 'strangers'  
have been restored.

Under external pressure, the rabbis deceptively eliminated or modified certain  
passages - but not the actual practices which are prescribed in them. It is a fact which  
must be remembered, not least by Jews themselves, that for centuries our totalitarian  
society has employed barbaric and inhumane customs to poison the minds of its  
members, and it is still doing so. (These inhumane customs cannot be explained away  
as mere reaction to antisemitism or persecution of Jews: they are gratuitous  
barbarities directed against each and every human being. A pious Jew arriving for the  
first time in [[Australia]], say, and chancing to pass near an [[Aboriginal]] graveyard, must -  
as an act of worship of 'God' - curse the mothers of the dead buried there.) Without  
facing this real social fact, we all become parties to the deception and accomplices to

the process of poisoning the present and future generations, with all the  
consequences of this process.

The Deception Continues

Modern scholars of Judaism have not only continued the deception, but have  
actually improved upon the old rabbinical methods, both in impudence and in  
mendacity. I omit here the various histories of antisemitism, as unworthy of serious  
consideration, and shall give just three particular examples and one general example  
of the more modern 'scholarly' deceptions.

In [[1962]], a part of the Maimonidean Code referred to above, the so-called Book  
of Knowledge, which contains the most basic rules of Jewish faith and practice, was  
published in Jerusalem in a bilingual edition, with the English translation facing the  
Hebrew text. (20) The latter has been restored to its original purity, and the  
command to exterminate Jewish infidels appears in it in full: 'It is a duty to  
exterminate them with one's own hands.' In the English translation this is somewhat  
softened to: 'It is a duty to take active measures to destroy them.' But then the  
Hebrew text goes on to specify the prime examples of 'infidels' who must be  
exterminated: 'Such as Jesus of Nazareth and his pupils, and Tzadoq and Baitos (21)  
and their pupils, may the name of the wicked rot'. Not one word of this appears in

\[25\] the English text on the facing page (78a). And, even more significant, in  
spite of the wide circulation of this book among scholars in the English-speaking  
countries, not one of them has, as far as I know, [[protest]]ed against this glaring  
deception.

The second example comes from the [[USA]], again from an English translation of  
a book by Maimonides. Apart from his work on the codification of the Talmud, he  
was also a philosopher and his Guide to the Perplexed is justly considered to be the  
greatest work of Jewish religious philosophy and is widely read and used even today.  
Unfortunately, in addition to his attitude towards non-Jews generally and Christians  
in particular, Maimonides was also an anti-Black racist. Towards the end of the  
Guide, in a crucial chapter (book III, chapter 51) he discusses how various sections of  
humanity can attain the supreme religious value, the true worship of God. Among  
those who are incapable of even approaching this are:

    "Some of the Turks [i.e., the Mongol race] and the nomads in the [[North]], and
    the Blacks and the nomads in the [[South]], and those who resemble them in our
    [[climate]]s. And their nature is like the nature of mute animals, and according to my
    opinion they are not on the level of human beings, and their level among existing
    things is below that of a man and above that of a monkey, because they have the
    image and the resemblance of a man more than a monkey does."
    

Now, what does one do with such a passage in a most important and necessary  
work of Judaism? Face the truth and its consequences? God forbid! Admit (as so  
many Christian scholars, for example, have done in similar circumstances) that a very  
important Jewish authority held also rabid anti-Black views, and by this admission  
make an attempt at self-education in real humanity? Perish the thought. I can almost

imagine Jewish scholars in the [[USA]] consulting among themselves, 'What is to be  
done?' - for the book had to be translated, due to the decline in the knowledge of  
Hebrew among [[America]]n Jews. Whether by consultation or by individual inspiration,  
a happy solution' was found: in the popular [[America]]n translation of the Guide by one  
Friedlander, first published as far back as [[1925]] and since then reprinted in many  
editions, including several in paperback, the Hebrew word Kushim, which means  
Blacks, was simply transliterated and appears as 'Kushites', a word which means  
nothing to those who have no knowledge of Hebrew, or to whom an obliging rabbi  
will not give an oral explanation. (22) During all these years, not a word has been said  
to point out the initial deception or the social facts underlying its continuation - and  
this throughout the excitement of Martin Luther

\[26\] [[King]]'s campaigns, which were supported by so many rabbis, not to mention  
other Jewish figures, some of whom must have been aware of the anti-Black racist  
attitude which forms part of their Jewish heritage. (23)

Surely one is driven to the hypothesis that quite a few of Martin Luther [[King]]'s  
rabbinical supporters were either anti-Black racists who supported him for tactical  
reasons of 'Jewish interest' (wishing to win Black support for [[America]]n Jewry and for  
[[Israel]]'s policies) or were accomplished hypocrites, to the point of schizophrenia,  
capable of passing very rapidly from a hidden enjoyment of rabid [[racism]] to a  
proclaimed attachment to an anti-racist struggle - and back - and back again.

    The third example comes from a work which has far less serious scholarly intent
    

+   but is all the more popular for that: The Joys of Yiddish by Leo Rosten. This light-  
    hearted work - first published in the [[USA]] in [[1968]], and reprinted in many editions,  
    including several times as a Penguin paperback - is a kind of glossary of Yiddish  
    words often used by Jews or even non-Jews in English-speaking countries. For each  
    entry, in addition to a detailed definition and more or less amusing anecdotes  
    illustrating its use, there is also an etymology stating (quite accurately, on the whole)  
    the language from which the word came into Yiddish and its meaning in that  
    language. The entry Shaygets - whose main meaning is 'a Gentile boy or young man’ -  
    is an exception: there the etymology cryptically states 'Hebrew Origin', without giving  
    the form or meaning of the original Hebrew word. However, under the entry Shiksa -  
    the feminine form of Shaygets - the author does give the original Hebrew word,  
    sheqetz (or, in his transliteration, sheques) and defines its Hebrew meaning as  
    'blemish'. This is a bare-faced lie, as every speaker of Hebrew knows. The Megiddo  
    Modern Hebrew-English Dictionary, published in [[Israel]], correctly defines shegetz as  
    follows: 'unclean animal; loathsome creature, abomination (colloquial - pronounced  
    shaygets) wretch, unruly youngster; Gentile youngster'.

My final, more general example is, if possible, even more shocking than the  
others. It concerns the attitude of the Hassidic movement towards non-Jews.  
Hassidism - a continuation (and debasement!) of Jewish mysticism - is still a living  
movement, with hundreds of thousands of active adherents who are fanatically  
devoted to their 'holy rabbis', some of whom have acquired a very considerable  
political in[[flu]]ence in [[Israel]], among the leaders of most parties and even more so in  
the higher echelons of the army.

    What, then, are the views of this movement concerning non-Jews? As an
    

example, let us take the famous Hatanya,

\[27\] funda[[mental]] book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important  
branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non-Jews are totally satanic  
creatures 'in whom there is absolutely nothing good'. Even a non-Jewish embryo is  
qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is  
essential', whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews.

This book is circulated in countless editions, and its ideas are further  
propagated in the numerous 'discourses' of the present hereditary Führer of Habbad,  
the so-called Lubavitcher rabbi, M.M. Schneerssohn, who leads this powerful world-  
wide organization from his [[New]] York headquarters. In [[Israel]] these ideas are widely  
disseminated among the public at large, in the schools and in the army. (According to  
the testimony of Shulamit Aloni, Member of the Knesset, this Habbad propaganda  
was particularly stepped up before [[Israel]]'s invasion of [[Lebanon]] in [[March]] [[1978]], in  
order to induce military doctors and nurses to withhold medical help from 'Gentile  
wounded'. This Nazi-like advice did not refer specifically to Arabs or Palestinians, but  
simply to 'Gentiles', goyim.) A former [[Israel]]i [[President]], Shazar, was an ardent  
adherent of Habbad, and many top [[Israel]]i and [[America]]n politicians - headed by  
Prime Minister Begin - publicly courted and supported it. This, in spite of the  
considerable unpopularity of the Lubavitcher rabbi - in [[Israel]] he is widely criticized  
because he refuses to come to the Holy Land even for a visit and keeps himself in [[New]]  
York for obscure messianic reasons, while in [[New]] York his anti-Black attitude is  
notorious.

The fact that, despite these pragmatic difficulties, Habbad can be publicly  
supported by so many top political figures owes much to the thoroughly disingenuous  
and misleading [[treatment]] by almost all scholars who have written about the Hassidic  
movement and its Habbad branch. This applies particularly to all who have written or  
are writing about it in English. They suppress the glaring evidence of the old Hassidic  
texts as well as the latter-day political implications that follow from them, which stare  
in the face of even a casual reader of the [[Israel]]i Hebrew press, in whose pages the  
Lubavitcher rabbi and other Hassidic leaders constantly publish the most rabid  
bloodthirsty statements and exhortations against all Arabs.

A chief deceiver in this case, and a good example of the power of the deception,  
was Martin Buber. His numerous works eulogizing the whole Hassidic movement  
(including Habbad) never so much as hint at the real doctrines of Hassidism  
concerning non-Jews. The crime of deception is all the greater in view of the fact that  
Buber's eulogies of

\[28\] Hassidism were first published in German during the period of the rise of  
German nationalism and the accession of Nazism to power. But while ostensibly  
opposing Nazism, Buber glorified a movement holding and actually teaching  
doctrines about non-Jews not unlike the Nazi doctrines about Jews. One could of  
course argue that the Hassidic Jews of seventy or fifty years ago were the victims, and  
a '[[white]] lie' favoring a victim is excusable. But the consequences of deception are  
incalculable. Buber's works were translated into Hebrew, were made a powerful  
element of the Hebrew education in [[Israel]], have greatly increased the power of the  
blood-thirsty Hassidic leaders, and have thus been an important factor in the rise of

[[Israel]]i chauvinism and hate of all non-Jews. If we think about the many human  
beings who died of their wounds because [[Israel]]i army nurses, incited by Hassidic  
propaganda, refused to tend them, then a heavy onus for their blood lies on the head  
of Martin Buber.

I must mention here that in his adulation of Hassidism Buber far surpassed  
other Jewish scholars, particularly those writing in Hebrew (or, formerly, in Yiddish)  
or even in [[Europe]]an languages but purely for a Jewish audience. In questions of  
internal Jewish interest, there had once been a great deal of justified criticism of the  
Hassidic movement. Their mysogynism (much more extreme than that common to all  
Jewish Orthodoxy), their indulgence in alcohol, their fanatical cult of their hereditary  
'holy rabbis' who extorted money from them, the numerous superstitions peculiar to  
them - these and many other negative traits were critically commented upon. But  
Buber's senti[[mental]] and deceitful romantization has won the day, especially in the  
[[USA]] and [[Israel]], because it was in tune with the totalitarian admiration of anything  
'genuinely Jewish' and because certain 'left' Jewish circles in which Buber had a  
particularly great in[[flu]]ence have adopted this position.

Nor was Buber alone in his attitude, although in my opinion he was by far the  
worst in the evil he propagated and the in[[flu]]ence he has left behind him. There was  
the very in[[flu]]ential sociologist and biblical scholar, Yehezkiel Kaufman, an advocate  
of genocide on the model of the Book of Joshua, the idealist philosopher Hugo  
Shmuel Bergman, who as far back as [[1914]]-15 advocated the expulsion of all  
Palestinians to Iraq, and many others. All were outwardly 'dovish', but employed  
formulas which could be manipulated in the most extreme anti-Arab sense, all had  
tendencies to that religious mysticism which encourages the propagation of  
deceptions, and all seemed to be gentle persons who, even when advocating  
expulsion, [[racism]] and genocide, seemed incapable of hurting a fly - and just for this

\[29\] reason the effect of their deceptions was the greater.

It is against the glorification of inhumanity, proclaimed not only by the rabbis  
but by those who are supposed to be the greatest and certainly the most in[[flu]]ential  
scholars of Judaism, that we have to struggle; and it is against those modern  
successors of the false prophets and dishonest priests that we have to repeat even in  
the face of an almost unanimous opinion within [[Israel]] and among the majority of  
Jews in countries such as the [[USA]] Lucretius' warning against surrendering one's  
judgement to the declamations of religious leaders: Tantum religio potuit suadere  
malorum - 'To such heights of evil are men driven by religion.' Religion is not always  
(as Marx said) the opium of the people, but it can often be so, and when it is used in  
this sense by prevaricating and misrepresenting its true nature, the scholars and  
intellectuals who perform this task take on the character of opium smugglers.

But we can derive from this analysis another, more general conclusion about the  
most effective and horrific means of compulsion to do evil, to cheat and to deceive  
and, while keeping one's hands quite clean of [[violence]], to corrupt whole peoples and  
drive them to oppression and murder. (For there can no longer be any doubt that the  
most horrifying acts of oppression in the West Bank are motivated by Jewish  
religious fanaticism.) Most people seem to assume that the worst totalitarianism  
employs physical coercion, and would refer to the imagery of Orwell's [[1984]] for a

model illustrating such a regime. But it seems to me that this common view is greatly  
mistaken, and that the intuition of Isaac Asimov, in whose [[[[science]]]] fiction the worst  
oppression is always internalized, is the more true to the dangers of human nature.  
Unlike Stalin's tame scholars, the rabbis - and even more so the scholars attacked  
here, and with them the whole mob of equally silent middlebrows such as writers,  
journalists, public figures, who lie and deceive more than them - are not facing the  
danger of [[death]] or concentration camp, but only social pressure; they lie out of  
patriotism because they believe that it is their duty to lie for what they conceive to be  
the Jewish interest. They are patriotic liars, and it is the same patriotism which  
reduces them to silence when confronted with the discrimination and oppression of  
the Palestinians.

In the present case we are also faced with another group loyalty, but one which  
comes from outside the group, and which is sometimes even more mischievous. Very  
many non- Jews (including Christian clergy and religious laymen, as well as some  
marxists from all marxist groups) hold the curious

\[30\] opinion that one way to 'atone' for the persecution of Jews is not to speak out  
against evil perpetrated by Jews but to participate in '[[white]] lies' about them. The  
crude accusation of 'antisemitism' (or, in the case of Jews, 'self-hate') against anybody  
who [[[[protest]]s]] at the discrimination of Palestinians or who points out any fact about  
the Jewish religion or the Jewish past which conflicts with the 'approved version'  
comes with greater hostility and force from non-Jewish 'friends of the Jews' than  
from Jews. It is the existence and great in[[flu]]ence of this group in all western  
countries, and particularly in the [[USA]] (as well as the other English-speaking  
countries) which has allowed the rabbis and scholars of Judaism to propagate their  
lies not only without opposition but with considerable help.

In fact, many professed 'anti-stalinists' have merely substituted another idol for  
their worship, and tend to support Jewish [[racism]] and fanaticism with even greater  
ardor and dishonesty than were found among the most devoted stalinists in the past.  
Although this phenomenon of blind and stalinistic support for any evil, so long as it is  
'Jewish', is particularly strong from [[1945]], when the truth about the extermination of  
[[Europe]]an Jewry became known, it is a mistake to suppose that it began only then. On  
the contrary, it dates very far back, particularly in social-democratic circles. One of  
Marx's early friends, Moses Hess, widely known and respected as one of the first  
socialists in Germany, subsequently revealed himself as an extreme Jewish racist,  
whose views about the 'pure Jewish race' published in [[1858]] were not unlike  
comparable bilge about the 'pure Aryan race'. But the German socialists, who  
struggled against German [[racism]], remained silent about their Jewish [[racism]].

In [[1944]], during the actual struggle against Hitler, the [[British]] Labor Party  
approved a plan for the expulsion of Palestinians from Palestine, which was similar to  
Hitler's early plans (up to about [[1941]]) for the Jews. This plan was approved under the  
pressure of Jewish members of the party's leadership, many of whom have displayed  
a stronger 'kith and kin' attitude to every [[Israel]]i policy than the Conservative 'kith  
and kin' supporters of Ian Smith ever did. But stalinistic taboos on the left are  
stronger in [[Britain]] than on the right, and there is virtually no discussion even when  
the Labor Party supports Begin's [[government]].

In the [[USA]] a similar situation prevails, and again the [[America]]n liberals are the  
worst.

This is not the place to explore all the political consequences of this situation,  
but we must face reality: in our

\[31\] struggle against the [[racism]] and fanaticism of the Jewish religion, our greatest  
enemies will be not only the Jewish racists (and users of [[racism]]) but also those non-  
Jews who in other areas are known - falsely in my opinion - as 'progressives'.

    Chapter 3
    

#### Orthodoxy and Interpretation

This chapter is devoted to a more detailed description of the theologico-legal  
structure of classical Judaism. (1) However, before embarking on that description it is  
necessary to dispel at least some of the many misconceptions disseminated in almost  
all foreign-language (that is, non-Hebrew) accounts of Judaism, especially by those  
who propagate such currently fashionable phrases as 'the Judeo-Christian tradition'  
or 'the common values of the monotheistic religions'.

Because of considerations of space I shall only deal in detail with the most  
important of these popular delusions: that the Jewish religion is, and always was,  
monotheistic. Now, as many biblical scholars know, and as a careful reading of the  
Old Testament easily reveals, this ahistorical view is quite wrong. In many, if not  
most, books of the Old Testament the existence and power of 'other gods' are clearly  
acknowledged, but Yahweh (Jehovah), who is the most powerful god, (2) is also very  
jealous of his rivals and forbids his people to worship them. (3) It is only very late in  
the Bible, in some of the later prophets, that the existence of all gods other than  
Yahweh is denied. (4)

What concerns us, however, is not biblical but classical Judaism; and it is quite  
clear, though much less widely realized, that the latter, during its last few hundred  
years, was for the most part far from pure monotheism. The same can be said about  
the real doctrines dominant in present-day Orthodox Judaism, which is a direct  
continuation of classical Judaism. The decay of monotheism came about through the  
spread of Jewish mysticism (the cabbala) which developed in the 12th and 13th  
centuries, and by the late 16th century had won an almost complete victory in  
virtually all the centers of Judaism. The Jewish Enlightenment, which arose out of  
the crisis of classical Judaism, had to fight against this mysticism and its in[[flu]]ence  
more than against anything else, but in latter-:lay Jewish Orthodoxy, especially  
among the rabbis, the in[[flu]]ence of the cabbala has remained predominant. (5) For  
example, the Gush Emunim movement is inspired to a great extent by cabbalistic  
ideas.

Knowledge and understanding of these ideas is therefore important for two  
reasons. First, without it one cannot

\[33\] understand the true beliefs of Judaism at the end of its classical period.  
Secondly, these ideas play an important contemporary political role, inasmuch as  
they form part of the explicit system of beliefs of many religious politicians, including  
most leaders of Gush Emunim, and have an indirect in[[flu]]ence on many Zionist  
leaders of all parties, including the zionist left.

According to the cabbala, the universe is ruled not by one god but by several  
deities, of various characters and in[[flu]]ences, emanated by a dim, distant First Cause.  
Omitting many details, one can summarize the system as follows. From the First  
Cause, first a male god called 'Wisdom' or 'Father' and then a female goddess called

'Knowledge' or 'Mother' were emanated or born. From the marriage of these two, a  
pair of younger gods were born: Son, also called by many other names such as 'Small  
Face' or 'The Holy Blessed One'; and Daughter, also called 'Lady' (or 'Matronit', a  
word derived from Latin), 'Shekhinah', '[[Queen]]', and so on. These two younger gods  
should be united, but their union is prevented by the machinations of Satan, who in  
this system is a very important and independent personage. The Creation was  
undertaken by the First Cause in order to allow them to unite, but because of the Fall  
they became more disunited than ever, and indeed Satan has managed to come very  
close to the divine Daughter and even to rape her (either seemingly or in fact -  
opinions differ on this). The creation of the Jewish people was undertaken in order to  
mend the break caused by Adam and Eve, and under Mount Sinai this was for a  
moment achieved: the male god Son, incarnated in Moses, was united with the  
goddess Shekhinah. Unfortunately, the sin of the Golden Calf again caused disunity  
in the godhead; but the repentance of the Jewish people has mended matters to some  
extent. Similarly, each incident of biblical Jewish [[history]] is believed to be associated  
with the union or disunion of the divine pair. The Jewish conquest of Palestine from  
the Canaanites and the building of the first and second Temple are particularly  
propitious for their. union, while the destruction of the Temples and exile of the Jews  
from the Holy Land are merely external signs not only of the divine disunion but also  
of a real 'whoring after strange gods': Daughter falls closely into the power of Satan,  
while Son takes various female satanic personages to his bed, instead of his proper  
wife.

The duty of pious Jews is to restore through their prayers and religious acts the  
perfect divine unity, in the form of sexual union, between the male and female deities.  
(6) Thus before most ritual acts, which every devout Jew has to perform many times  
each day, the following cabbalistic formula is recited: 'For the

\[34\] sake of the \[sexual\] [[congress]] (7) of the Holy Blessed One and his Shekhinah... '  
The Jewish morning prayers are also arranged so as to promote this sexual union, if  
only temporarily. Successive parts of the prayer mystically correspond to successive  
stages of the union: at one point the goddess approaches with her handmaidens, at  
another the god puts his arm around her neck and fondles her breast, and finally the  
sexual act is supposed to take place.

Other prayers or religious acts, as interpreted by the cabbalists, are designed to  
deceive various angels (imagined as minor deities with a measure of independence)  
or to propitiate Satan. At a certain point in the morning prayer, some verses in  
Aramaic (rather than the more usual Hebrew) are pronounced. (8) This is supposed  
to be a means for tricking the angels who operate the gates through which prayers  
enter heaven and who have the power to block the prayers of the pious. The angels  
only understand Hebrew and are baffled by the Aramaic verses; being somewhat dull-  
witted (presumably they are far less clever than the cabbalists) they open the gates,  
and at this moment all the prayers, including those in Hebrew, get through. Or take  
another example: both before and after a meal, a pious Jew ritually washes his hands,  
uttering a special blessing. On one of these two occasions he is worshiping God, by  
promoting the divine union of Son and Daughter; but on the other he is worshiping  
Satan, who likes Jewish prayers and ritual acts so much that when he is offered a few  
of them it keeps him busy for a while and he forgets to pester the divine Daughter.  
Indeed, the cabbalists believe that some of the sacrifices burnt in the Temple were  
intended for Satan. For example, the seventy bullocks sacrificed during the seven

days of the feast of Tabernacles (9) were supposedly offered to Satan in his capacity  
as ruler of all the Gentiles, (10) in order to keep him too busy to interfere on the  
eighth day, when sacrifice is made to God. Many other examples of the same kind can  
be given.

Several points should be made concerning this system and its importance for  
the proper understanding of Judaism, both in its classical period and in its present  
political involvement in Zionist practice.  
First, whatever can be said about this cabbalistic system, it cannot be regarded  
as monotheistic, unless one is also prepared to regard Hinduism, the late Graeco-  
[[Roma]]n religion, or even the religion of ancient [[Egypt]], as 'monotheistic'.  
Secondly, the real nature of classical Judaism is illustrated by the ease with  
which this system was adopted. Faith and beliefs (except nationalistic beliefs) play an  
extremely small

\[35\] part in classical Judaism. What is of prime importance is the ritual act, rather  
than the significance which that act is supposed to have or the belief attached to it.  
Therefore in times when a minority of religious Jews refused to accept the cabbala (as  
is the case today), one could see some few Jews performing a given religious ritual  
believing it to be an act of worship of God, while others do exactly the same thing  
with the intention of propitiating Satan - but so long as the act is the same they would  
pray together and remain members of the same congregation, however much they  
might dislike each other. But if instead of the intention attached to the ritual washing  
of hands anyone would dare to introduce an innovation in the manner of washing,  
(11) a real schism would certainly ensue.

The same can be said about all sacred formulas of Judaism. Provided the  
working is left intact, the meaning is at best a secondary matter. For example,  
perhaps the most sacred Jewish formula, 'Hear 0 [[Israel]], the Lord is our God, the Lord  
is one', recited several times each day by every pious Jew, can at the present time  
mean two contrary things. It can mean that the Lord is indeed 'one'; but it can also  
mean that a certain stage in the union of the male and female deities has been  
reached or is being promoted by the proper recitation of this formula. However, when  
Jews of a Reformed congregation recite this formula in any language other than  
Hebrew, all Orthodox rabbis, whether they believe in unity or in the divine sexual  
union, are very angry indeed.

Finally, all this is of considerable importance in [[Israel]] (and in other Jewish  
centers) even at present. The enormous significance attached to mere formulas (such  
as the 'Law of Jerusalem'); the ideas and motivations of Gush Emunim; the urgency  
behind the hate for non-Jews presently living in Palestine; the fatalistic attitude  
towards all peace attempts by Arab states - all these and many other traits of Zionist  
politics, which puzzle so many well-meaning people who have a false notion about  
classical Judaism, become more intelligible against this religious and mystical  
background. I must warn, however, against falling into the other extreme and trying  
to explain all zionist politics in terms of this background. Obviously, the latter's  
in[[flu]]ences vary in extent. Ben-Gurion was adept at manipulating them in a controlled  
way for specific ends. Under Begin the past exerts a much greater in[[flu]]ence upon the  
present. But what one should never do is to ignore the past and its in[[flu]]ences,  
because only by knowing it can one transcend its blind power.

###### \[36\]

Interpretation of the Bible

It will be seen from the foregoing example that what most supposedly well-  
informed people think they know about Judaism may be very misleading, unless they  
can read Hebrew. All the details mentioned above can be found in the original texts  
or, in some cases, in modern books written in Hebrew for a rather specialized  
readership. In English one would look for them in vain, even where the omission of  
such socially important facts distorts the whole picture.

There is yet another misconception about Judaism which is particularly  
common among Christians, or people heavily in[[flu]]enced by Christian tradition and  
culture. This is the misleading idea that Judaism is a 'biblical religion'; that the Old  
Testament has in Judaism the same central place and legal authority which the Bible  
has for Protestant or even Catholic Christianity.

Again, this is connected with the question of interpretation. We have seen that  
in matters of belief there is great latitude. Exactly the opposite holds with respect to  
the legal interpretation of sacred texts. Here the interpretation is rigidly fixed - but by  
the Talmud rather than by the Bible itself. (12) Many, perhaps most, biblical verses  
prescribing religious acts and obligations are 'understood' by classical Judaism, and  
by present-:lay Orthodoxy, in a sense which is quite distinct from, or even contrary  
to, their literal meaning as understood by Christian or other readers of the Old  
Testament, who only see the plain text. The same division exists at present in [[Israel]]  
between those educated in Jewish religious schools and those educated in 'secular'  
Hebrew schools, where on the whole the plain meaning of the Old Testament is  
taught.

This important point can only be understood through examples. It will be noted  
that the changes in meaning do not all go in the same direction from the point of view  
of ethics, as the term is understood now. Apologetics of Judaism claim that the  
interpretation of the Bible, originated by the Pharisees and fixed in the Talmud, is  
always more liberal than the literal sense. But some of the examples below show that  
this is far from being the case.

1.  Let us start with the Decalogue itself. The Eighth Commandment, Thou shalt  
    not steal' (Exodus, 20:15), is taken to be a prohibition against 'stealing' (that is,  
    kidnapping) a Jewish person. The reason is that according to the Talmud all acts  
    forbidden by the Decalogue are capital offenses. Stealing [[property]] is not a capital  
    offense (while kidnapping of Gentiles by Jews is allowed by talmudic law) - hence the  
    interpretation. A virtually identical

\[37\] sentence - 'Ye shall not steal' (Leviticus, 19:11) - is however allowed to have its  
literal meaning.

2.  The famous verse 'Eye for eye, tooth for tooth' etc. (Exodus, 21:24) is taken to  
    mean 'eye-money for eye', that is payment of a fine rather than physical retribution.

3.  Here is a notorious case of turning the literal meaning into its exact opposite.  
    The biblical text plainly warns against following the bandwagon in an unjust cause:  
    thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to  
    decline after many to wrest judgment' (Exodus, 23:2). The last words of this sentence

+   'Decline after many to wrest judgment' - are torn out of their context and  
    interpreted as an injunction to follow the majority

4.  The verse 'Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk' (Exodus, 23:19) is  
    interpreted as a ban on mixing any kind of meat with any milk or milk product. Since  
    the same verse is repeated in two other places in the Pentateuch, the mere repetition  
    is taken to be a treble ban, forbidding a Jew (i) to eat such a mixture, (ii) to cook it for  
    any purpose and (iii) to enjoy or benefit from it in any way. (13)

5 ) In numerous cases general terms such as 'thy fellow', 'stranger', or even  
'man' are taken to have an exelusivist chauvinistic meaning. The famous verse 'thou  
shalt love thy fellow (14) as thyself (Leviticus, 19:18) is understood by classical (and  
present-day Orthodox) Judaism as an injunction to love one's fellow Jew, not any  
fellow human. Similarly, the verse 'neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy  
fellow' (ibid., 16) is supposed to mean that one must not stand idly by when the life  
('blood') of a fellow Jew is in danger; but, as will be seen in Chapter 5, a Jew is in  
general forbidden to save the life of a Gentile, because 'he is not thy fellow'. The  
generous injunction to leave the gleanings of one's field and vineyard 'for the poor  
and the stranger' (ibid., 9-10) is interpreted as referring exclusively to the Jewish  
poor and to converts to Judaism. The taboo laws relating to corpses begin with the  
verse 'This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent ... shall  
be unclean seven days' (Numbers, 19:16). But the word 'man' (adam) is taken to  
mean 'Jew', so that only a Jewish corpse is taboo (that is, both 'unclean' and sacred).  
Based on this interpretation, pious Jews have a tremendous magic reverence towards  
Jewish corpses and Jewish cemeteries, but have no respect towards non-Jewish  
corpses and cemeteries. Thus hundreds of Muslim cemeteries have been utterly  
destroyed in [[Israel]] (in one case in order to make room

\[38\] for the Tel-Aviv Hilton) but there was a great outcry because the Jewish  
cemetery on the Mount of Olives was damaged under Jordanian rule. Examples of  
this kind are too numerous to quote. Some of the inhuman consequences of this type  
of interpretation will be discussed in Chapter 5.

6.  Finally, consider one of the most beautiful prophetic passages, Isaiah's  
    magnificent condemnation of hypocrisy and empty ritual, and exhortation to  
    common decency. One verse (Isaiah, 1:15) in this passage is: 'And when ye spread  
    forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I  
    will not hear: your hands are full of blood.' Since Jewish priests 'spread their hands'  
    when blessing the people during service, this verse is supposed to mean that a priest  
    who commits accidental homicide is disqualified from 'spreading his hands' in  
    blessing (even if repentant) because they are 'full of blood'.

It is quite clear even from these examples that when Orthodox Jews today (or all  
Jews before about [[1780]]) read the Bible, they are reading a very different book, with a  
totally different meaning, from the Bible as read by non-Jews or non-Orthodox Jews.  
This distinction applies even in [[Israel]], although both parties read the text in Hebrew.

Experience, particularly since [[1967]], has repeatedly corroborated this. Many Jews in  
[[Israel]] (and elsewhere), who are not Orthodox and have little detailed knowledge of  
the Jewish religion, have tried to shame Orthodox [[Israel]]is (or right-wingers who are  
strongly in[[flu]]enced by religion) out of their inhuman attitude towards the  
Palestinians, by quoting at them verses from the Bible in their plain humane sense. It  
was always found, however, that such arguments do not have the slightest effect on  
those who follow classical Judaism; they simply do not understand what is being said  
to them, because to them the biblical text means something quite different than to  
everyone else.

If such a communication gap exists in [[Israel]], where people read Hebrew and can  
readily obtain correct information if they wish, one can imagine how deep is the  
misconception abroad, say among people educated in the Christian tradition. In fact,  
the more such a person reads the Bible, the less he or she knows about Orthodox  
Judaism. For the latter regards the Old Testament as a text of immutable sacred  
formulas, whose recitation is an act of great merit, but whose meaning is wholly  
determined elsewhere. And, as Humpty Dumpty told Alice, behind the problem of  
who can determine the meaning of words, there stands the real question: 'Which is to  
be master?'

###### \[39\]

Structure of the Talmud

It should therefore be clearly understood that the source of authority for all the  
practices of classical (and present-day Orthodox) Judaism, the deter[[mining]] base of  
its legal structure, is the Talmud, or, to be precise, the so-called Babylonian Talmud;  
while the rest of the talmudic literature (including the so~called Jerusalem or  
Palestinian Talmud) acts as a supplementary authority.

We cannot enter here into a detailed description of the Talmud and talmudic  
literature, but confine ourselves to a few principal points needed for our argument.  
Basically, the Talmud consists of two parts. First, the Mishnah - a terse legal code  
consisting of six volumes, each subdivided into several tractates, written in Hebrew,  
redacted in Palestine around AD 200 out of the much more extensive (and largely  
oral) legal material composed during the preceding two centuries. The second and by  
far predominant part is the Gemarah - a voluminous record of discussions on and  
around the Mishnah. There are two, roughly parallel, sets of Gemarah, one composed  
in Mesopotamia ('Babylon') between about AD 200 and 500, the other in Palestine  
between about AD 200 and some unknown date long before 500. The Babylonian  
Talmud (that is, the Mishnah plus the Mesopotamian Gemarah) is much more  
extensive and better arranged than the Palestinian, and it alone is regarded as  
definitive and authoritative. The Jerusalem (Palestinian) Talmud is accorded a  
decidedly lower status as a legal authority, along with a number of compilations,  
known collectively as the 'talmudic literature', containing material which the editors  
of the two Talmuds had left out.

Contrary to the Mishnah, the rest of the Talmud and talmudic literature is  
written in a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic, the latter language predominating in  
the Babylonian Talmud. Also, it is not limited to legal matters. Without any apparent

order or reason, the legal discussion can suddenly be interrupted by what is referred  
to as 'Narrative' (Aggadah) a medley of tales and anecdotes about rabbis or ordinary  
folk, biblical figures, angels, demons, witchcraft and miracles. (15) These narrative  
passages, although of great popular in[[flu]]ence in Judaism through the ages, were  
always considered (even by the Talmud itself) as having secondary value. Of greatest  
importance for classical Judaism are the legal parts of the text, particularly the  
discussion of cases which are regarded as problematic. The Talmud itself defines the  
various categories of Jews, in ascending order, as follows, The lowest are the totally  
ignorant, then come those who only know the Bible, then those who are familiar with  
the Mishnah or Aggadah,

\[40\] and the superior class are those who have studied, and are able to discuss the  
legal part of the Gemarah. It is only the latter who are fit to lead their fellow Jews in  
all things.

The legal system of the Talmud can be described as totally comprehensive,  
rigidly authoritarian, and yet capable of infinite development, without however any  
change in its dogmatic base. Every aspect of Jewish life, both individual and social, is  
covered, usually in considerable detail, with sanctions and punishments provided for  
every conceivable sin or infringement of the rules. The basic rules for every problem  
are stated dogmatically and cannot be questioned. What can be and is discussed at  
very great length is the elaboration and practical definition of these rules. Let me give  
a few examples.

'Not doing any work' on the sabbath. The concept work is defined as comprising  
exactly 39 types of work, neither more nor less. The criterion for inclusion in this list  
has nothing to do with the arduousness of a given task; it is simply a matter of  
dogmatic definition. One forbidden type of 'work' is writing. The question then arises:  
How many characters must one write in order to commit the sin of writing on the  
sabbath? (Answer: Two). Is the sin the same, irrespective of which hand is used?  
(Answer: No). However, in order to guard against falling into sin, the primary  
prohibition on writing is hedged with a secondary ban on touching any writing  
implement on the sabbath.

Another prototypical work forbidden on the sabbath is the grinding of grain.  
From this it is deduced, by analogy, that any kind of grinding of anything whatsoever  
is forbidden. And this in turn is hedged by a ban on the practice of medicine on the  
sabbath (except in cases of danger to Jewish life), in order to guard against falling  
into the sin of grinding a medicament. It is in vain to point out that in modern times  
such a danger does not exist (nor, for that matter, did it exist in many cases even in  
talmudic times); for, as a hedge around the hedge, the Talmud explicitly forbids  
liquid medicines and restorative drinks on the sabbath. What has been fixed remains  
for ever fixed, however absurd. Tertullian, one of the early Church Fathers, had  
written, 'I believe it because it is absurd.' This can serve as a motto for the majority of  
talmudic rules, with the word 'believe' replaced by 'practice'.

The following example illustrates even better the level of absurdity reached by  
this system. One of the prototypes of work forbidden on the sabbath is harvesting.  
This is stretched, by analogy, to a ban on breaking a branch off a tree. Hence, riding a  
horse (or any other animal) is forbidden, as a hedge against the temptation to break a

branch off a tree for flogging the beast. It is useless to argue that you have a ready-  
made

\[41\] whip, or that you intend to ride where there are no trees. What is forbidden  
remains forbidden for ever. It can, however, be stretched and made stricter: in  
modern times, riding a bicycle on the sabbath has been forbidden, because it is  
analogous to riding a horse.

My final example illustrates how the same methods are used also in purely  
theoretical cases, having no conceivable application in reality. During the existence of  
the Temple, the High [[Priest]] was only allowed to marry a virgin. Although during  
virtually the whole of the talmudic period there was no longer a Temple or a High  
[[Priest]], the Talmud devotes one of its more involved (and bizarre) discussions to the  
precise definition of the term 'virgin' fit to marry a High [[Priest]]. What about a woman  
whose hymen had been broken by accident? Does it make any difference whether the  
accident occurred before or after the age of three? By the impact of metal or of wood?  
Was she climbing a tree? And if so, was she climbing up or down? Did it happen  
naturally or unnaturally? All this and much else besides is discussed in lengthy detail.  
And every scholar in classical Judaism had to master hundreds of such problems.  
[[Great]] scholars were measured by their ability to develop these problems still further,  
for as shown by the examples there is always scope for further development - if only  
in one direction - and such development did actually continue after the final  
redaction of the Talmud.

However, there are two great differences between the talmudic period (ending  
around AD 500) and the period of classical Judaism (from about AD 800). The  
geographical area reflected in the Talmud is confined, whereas the Jewish society  
reflected in it is a 'complete' society, with Jewish agriculture as its basis. (This is true  
for Mesopotamia as well as Palestine.) Although at that time there were Jews living  
throughout the [[Roma]]n Empire and in many areas of the Sassanid Empire, it is quite  
evident from the talmudic text that its composition - over half a millennium - was a  
strictly local affair. No scholars from countries other than Mesopotamia and Palestine  
took part in it, nor does the text reflect social conditions outside these two areas.

Very little is known about the social and religious conditions of the Jews in the  
intervening three centuries. But from AD 800 on, when more detailed historical  
information is again available, we find that the two features mentioned above had  
been reversed. The Babylonian Talmud (and to a much lesser degree the rest of the  
talmudic literature) is acknowledged as authoritative, studied and developed in all  
Jewish communities. At the same time, Jewish society had undergone

\[42\] a deep change: whatever and wherever it is, it does not include peasants.

The social system resulting from this change will be discussed in Chapter 4.  
Here we shall describe how the Talmud was adapted to the conditions -  
geographically much wider and socially much narrower, and at any rate radically  
different - of classical Judaism. We shall concentrate on what is in my opinion the  
most important method of adaptation, namely the dispensations.

The Dispensations

As noted above, the talmudic system is most dogmatic and does not allow any  
relaxation of its rules even when they are reduced to absurdity by a change in  
circumstances. And in the case of the Talmud - contrary to that of the Bible - the  
literal sense of the text is binding, and one is not allowed to interpret it away. But in  
the period of classical Judaism various talmudic laws became untenable for the  
Jewish ruling classes - the rabbis and the rich. In the interest of these ruling classes, a  
method of systematic deception was devised for keeping the letter of the law, while  
violating its spirit and intention. It was this hypocritical system of 'dispensations'  
(heterim) which, in my view, was the most important cause of the debasement of  
Judaism in its classical epoch. (The second cause was Jewish mysticism, which  
however operated for a much shorter period of time.) Again, some examples are  
needed to illustrate how the system works.

(1) Taking of interest. The Talmud strictly forbids a Jew, on pain of severe  
punishment, to take interest on a loan made to another Jew. (According to a majority  
of talmudic authorities, it is a religious duty to take as much interest as possible on a  
loan made to a Gentile.) Very detailed rules forbid even the most far-fetched forms in  
which a Jewish lender might benefit from a Jewish debtor. All Jewish accomplices to  
such an illicit transaction, including the scribe and the witnesses, are branded by the  
Talmud as infamous persons, disqualified from testifying in court, because by  
participating in such an act a Jew as good as declares that 'he has no part in the god  
of [[Israel]]'. It is evident that this law is well suited to the needs of Jewish peasants or  
artisans, or of small Jewish communities who use their money for lending to non-  
Jews. But the situation was very different in east [[Europe]] (mainly in [[Poland]]) by the  
16th century. There was a relatively big Jewish community, which constituted the  
majority in many towns. The peasants, subjected to strict serfdom not far removed  
from [[slavery]], were hardly in a position

\[43\] to borrow at all, while lending to the nobility was the business of a few very rich  
Jews. Many Jews were doing business with each other.

In these circumstances, the following arrangement (called heter 'isqa - 'business  
dispensation') was devised for an interest-bearing loan between Jews, which does not  
violate the letter of the law, because formally it is not a loan at all. The lender 'invests'  
his money in the business of the borrower, stipulating two conditions. First, that the  
borrower will pay the lender at an agreed future date a stated sum of money (in  
reality, the interest in the loan) as the lender's 'share in the profits'. Secondly, that the  
borrower will be presumed to have made sufficient profit to give the lender his share,  
unless a claim to the contrary is corroborated by the testimony of the town's rabbi or  
rabbinical judge, etc, - who, by arrangement, refuse to testify in such cases. In  
practice all that is required is to take a text of this dispensation, written in Aramaic  
and entirely incomprehensible to the great majority, and put it on a wall of the room  
where the transaction is made (a copy of this text is displayed in all branches of  
[[Israel]]i banks) or even to keep it in a chest - and the interest-bearing loan between  
Jews becomes perfectly legal and blameless,

(2) The sabbatical year. According to talmudic law (based on Leviticus, 25)  
Jewish-owned land in Palestine (16) must be left fallow every seventh ('sabbatical')  
year, when all agricultural work (including harvesting) on such land is forbidden.  
There is ample evidence that this law was rigorously observed for about one thousand

years, from the 5th century BC till the disappearance of Jewish agriculture in  
Palestine. Later, when there was no occasion to apply the law in practice, it was kept  
theoretically intact. However, in the [[1880]]s, with the establishment of the first Jewish  
agricultural colonies in Palestine, it became a matter of practical concern. Rabbis  
sympathetic to the settlers helpfully devised a dispensation, which was later perfected  
by their successors in the religious zionist parties and has become an established  
[[Israel]]i practice.

This is how it works. Shortly before a sabbatical year, the [[Israel]]i Minister of  
Internal Affairs gives the Chief Rabbi a document making him the legal owner of all  
[[Israel]]i land, both private and public. Armed with this paper, the Chief Rabbi goes to a  
non-Jew and sells him all the land of [[Israel]] (and, since [[1967]], the Occupied  
[[Territories]]) for a nominal sum. A separate document stipulates that the 'buyer' will  
'resell' the land back after the year is over. And this transaction is repeated every  
seven years, usually with the same 'buyer'.

###### \[44\]

Non-zionist rabbis do not recognize the validity of this dispensation, (17)  
claiming correctly that, since religious law for- bids Jews to sell land in Palestine to  
Gentiles, the whole transaction is based on a sin and hence null and void. The zionist  
rabbis reply, however, that what is forbidden is a real sale, not a fictitious one!

(3) Milking on the sabbath. This has been forbidden in post- talmudic  
times, through the process of increasing religious severity mentioned above. The ban  
could easily be kept in the diaspora, since Jews who had cows of their own were  
usually rich enough to have non-Jewish servants, who could be ordered (using one of  
the subterfuges described below) to do the milking. The early Jewish colonists in  
Palestine employed Arabs for this and other purposes, but with the forcible  
imposition of the Zionist policy of exclusive Jewish labor there was need for a  
dispensation. (This was particularly important before the introduction of mechanized  
milking in the late [[1950]]s.) Here too there was a difference between zionist and non-  
zionist rabbis.

According to the former, the forbidden milking becomes permitted provided the  
milk is not [[white]] but dyed blue. This blue Saturday milk is then used exclusively for  
making cheese, and the dye is washed off into the whey. Non-zionist rabbis have  
devised a much subtler scheme (which I personally witnessed operating in a religious  
kibbutz in [[1952]]). They discovered an old provision which allows the udders of a cow  
to be emptied on the sabbath, purely for relieving the suffering caused to the animal  
by bloated udders, and on the strict condition that the milk runs to waste on the  
ground. Now, this is what is actually done: on Saturday morning, a pious kibbutznik  
goes to the cowshed and places pails under the cows. (There is no ban on such work  
in the whole of the talmudic literature.) He then goes to the synagogue to pray. Then  
comes his colleague, whose 'honest intention' is to relieve the animals' pain and let  
their milk run to the floor. But if, by chance, a pail happens to be standing there, is he  
under any obligation to remove it? Of course not. He simply 'ignores' the pails, fulfills  
his mission of mercy and goes to the synagogue. Finally a third pious colleague goes  
into the cowshed and discovers, to his great surprise, the pails full of milk. So he puts  
them in cold storage and follows his comrades to the synagogue. Now all is well, and

there is no need to waste money on blue dye.

(4) Mixed [[crops]]. Similar dispensations were issued by zionist rabbis in  
respect of the ban (based on Leviticus, 19:19) against sowing two different species of  
crop in the same field. Modern agronomy has however shown that in some cases  
(especially in growing

\[45\] fodder) mixed sowing is the most profitable. The rabbis invented a dispensation  
according to which one man sows the field length- wise with one kind of seed, and  
later that day his comrade, who 'does not know' about the former, sows another kind  
of seed crosswise. However, this method was felt to be too wasteful of labor, and a  
better one was devised: one man makes a heap of one kind of seed in a public place  
and carefully covers it with a sack or piece of board. The second kind of seed is then  
put on top of the cover. Later, another man comes and exclaims, in front of witnesses,  
'I need this sack (or board)' and removes it, so that the seeds mix 'naturally'. Finally, a  
third man comes along and is told,'Take this and sow the field,' which he proceeds to  
do. (18)

(5) Leavened substances must not be eaten or even kept in the possession of  
a Jew during the seven (or, outside Palestine, eight) days of Passover. The concept  
'leavened substances' was continually broadened and the aversion to so much as  
seeing them during the festival approached hysteria. They include all kinds of flour  
and even unground grain. In the original talmudic society this was bearable, because  
bread (leavened or not) was usually baked once a week; a peasant family would use  
the last of the previous year's grain to bake unleavened bread for the festival, which  
ushers in the new harvest season. However, in the conditions of post-Talmudic  
[[Europe]]an Jewry the observance was very hard on a middle-class Jewish family and  
even more so on a [[corn]] merchant. A dispensation was therefore devised, by which all  
those substances are sold in a fictitious sale to a Gentile before the festival and  
bought back automatically after it. The one thing that must be done is to lock up the  
taboo substances for the duration of the festival. In [[Israel]] this fictitious sale has been  
made more efficient. Religious Jews 'sell' their leavened substances to their local  
rabbis, who in turn 'sell' them to the Chief Rabbis; the latter sell them to a Gentile,  
and by a special dispensation this sale is presumed to include also the leavened  
substances of non-practising Jews.

(6) Sabbath-Goy. Perhaps the most developed dispensations concern the 'Goy  
(Gentile) of Sabbath'. As mentioned above, the range of tasks banned on the sabbath  
has widened continually; but the range of tasks that must be carried out or supervised  
to satisfy~ needs or to increase comfort also keeps widening. This is particularly true  
in modern times, but the effect of technological change began to be felt long ago. The  
ban against grinding on the sabbath was a relatively light matter for a Jewish peasant  
or artisan, say in second-century Palestine, who used a hand mill for domestic  
purposes. It was quite a different matter for a tenant of a water mill or windmill one  
of the most common Jewish

\[46\] occupations in eastern [[Europe]]. But even such a simple human problem' as the  
wish to have a hot cup of tea on a Saturday afternoon becomes much greater with the  
tempting samovar, used regularly on weekdays, standing in the room. These are just  
two examples out of a very large number of so-called 'problems of sabbath

observance'. And one can state with certainty that for a community composed  
exclusively of Orthodox Jews they were quite insoluble, at least during the last eight  
or ten centuries, without the 'help' of non-Jews. This is even more true today in the  
'Jewish state', because many public services, such as water, gas and electricity, fall in  
this category. Classical Judaism could not exist even for a whole week without using  
some non-Jews.

But without special dispensations there is a great obstacle in employing non-  
Jews to do these Saturday jobs; for talmudic regulations forbid Jews to ask a Gentile  
to do on the sabbath any work which they themselves are banned from doing. (19) I  
shall describe two of the many types of dispensation used for such purposes.

First, there is the method of 'hinting', which depends on the casuistic logic  
according to which a sinful demand becomes blameless if it is phrased slyly. As rule,  
the hint must be obscure', but in cases of extreme need a 'clear' hint is allowed. For  
example, in a recent booklet on religious observance for the use of [[Israel]]i soldiers, the  
latter are taught how to talk to Arab workers employed by the army as sabbath-Goy.  
In urgent cases, such as when it is very cold and a fire must be lit, or when light is  
needed for a religious service, a pious Jewish soldier may use a 'clear' hint and tell the  
Arab: 'It is cold (or dark) here'. But normally an 'obscure' hint must suffice, for  
example: 'It would be more pleasant if it were warmer here' (20) This method of  
'hinting' is particularly repulsive and degrading inasmuch as it is normally used on  
non-Jews who, due to their [[poverty]] or subordinate social position, are wholly in the  
power of their Jewish employer. A Gentile servant (or employee of the [[Israel]]i army)  
who does not train himself to interpret 'obscure hints' as orders will be pitilessly  
dismissed.

The second method is used in cases where what the Gentile is required to do on  
Saturday is not an occasional task or personal service, which can be 'hinted' at as the  
need arises, but a routine or regular job without constant Jewish supervision.  
According to this method - called 'implicit inclusion' (havla'ah) of the sabbath among  
weekdays - the Gentile is hired 'for the whole week (or year)', without the sabbath  
being so much as mentioned in the contract. But in reality work is only performed on  
the sabbath. This method was used in the past in hiring a Gentile to put out the  
candles

\[47\] in the synagogue after the sabbath-eve prayer (rather than wastefully  
allowing them to burn out). Modern [[Israel]]i examples are: regulating the water supply  
or watching over water reservoirs on Saturdays. (21)

A similar idea is used also in the case of Jews, but for a different end. Jews are  
forbidden to receive any payment for work done on the sabbath, even if the work  
itself is permitted. The chief example here concerns the sacred professions: the rabbi  
or talmudic scholar who preaches or teaches on the sabbath, the cantor who sings  
only on Saturdays and other holy days (on which similar bans apply), the sexton and  
similar officials. In talmudic times, and in some countries even several centuries  
after, such jobs were unpaid. But later, when these became salaried professions, the  
dispensation of 'implicit inclusion was used, and they were hired on a 'monthly' or  
'yearly' basis. In the case of rabbis and talmudic scholars the problem is particularly  
complicated, because the Talmud forbids them to receive any payment for preaching,

teaching or studying talmudic matters even on weekdays. (22) For them an additional  
dispensation stipulates that their salary is not really a salary at all but 'compensation  
for idleness' (dmey batalah). As a combined result of these two fictions, what is in  
reality payment for work done mainly, or even solely, on the sabbath is  
transmogrified into payment for being idle on weekdays.

Social Aspects of Dispensations

Two social features of these and many similar practices deserve special  
mention.

First, a dominant feature of this system of dispensations, and of classical  
Judaism inasmuch as it is based on them, is deception - deception primarily of God, if  
this word can be used for an imaginary being so easily deceived by the rabbis, who  
consider themselves cleverer than him. No greater contrast can be conceived than  
that between the God of the Bible (particularly of the greater prophets) and of the  
God of classical Judaism. The latter is more like the early [[Roma]]n Jupiter, who was  
likewise bamboozled by his worshipers, or the gods described in Frazer's Golden  
Bough.

From the ethical point of view, classical Judaism represents a process of  
degeneration, which is still going on; and this degeneration into a tribal collection of  
empty rituals and magic superstitions has very important social and political  
consequences. For it must be remembered that it is precisely the superstitions of  
classical Judaism which have the greatest hold on the Jewish masses, rather than  
those parts of the Bible or

\[48\] even the Talmud which are of real religious and ethical value. (The same can be  
observed also in other religions which are now undergoing revival.) What is popularly  
regarded as the most 'holy' and solemn occasion of the Jewish liturgical year,  
attended even by very many Jews who are otherwise far from religion? It is the Kol  
Nidrey prayer on the eve of Yom Kippur - a chanting of a particularly absurd and  
deceptive dispensation. by which all private vows made to God in the following year  
are declared in advance to be null and void. (23) Or, in the area of personal religion,  
the Qadish prayer, said on days of mourning by sons for their parents in order to  
elevate their departed souls to paradise - a recitation of an Aramaic text,  
incomprehensible to the great majority. Quite obviously, the. popular regard given to  
these, the most superstitious parts of the Jewish religion, is not given to its better  
parts.

Together with the deception of God goes the deception of other Jews, mainly in  
the interest of the Jewish ruling class. It is characteristic that no dispensations were  
allowed in the specific interest of the Jewish poor. For example, Jews who were  
starving but not actually on the point of [[death]] were never allowed by their rabbis  
(who did not often go hungry themselves) to eat any sort of forbidden food, though  
kosher food is usually more expensive.

The second dominant feature of the dispensations is that they are in large part  
obviously motivated by the spirit of profit. And it is this combination of hypocrisy and  
the profit motive which increasingly dominated classical Judaism. In [[Israel]], where

the process goes on, this is dimly perceived by popular opinion, despite all the official  
brainwashing promoted by the education system and the media. The religious  
establishment - the rabbis and the religious parties - and, by association, to some  
extent the Orthodox community as a whole, are quite unpopular in [[Israel]]. One of the  
most important reasons for this is precisely their reputation for duplicity and  
venality. Of course, popular opinion (which may often be prejudiced) is not the same  
thing as social analysis; but in this particular case it is actually true that the Jewish  
religious establishment does have a strong tendency to chicanery and graft, due to the  
corrupting in[[flu]]ence of the Orthodox Jewish religion. Because in general social life  
religion is only one of the social in[[flu]]ences, its effect on the mass of believers is not  
nearly so great as on the rabbis and leaders of the religious parties. Those religious  
Jews in [[Israel]] who are honest, as the majority of them undoubtedly are, are so not  
because of the in[[flu]]ence of their religion and rabbis, but in spite of it. On the other  
hand, in those few areas of public

\[49\] life in [[Israel]] which are wholly dominated by religious circles, the level of  
chicanery, venality and corruption is notorious, far surpassing the 'average' level  
tolerated by general, non-religious [[Israel]]i society.

In Chapter 4 we shall see how the dominance of the profit motive in classical  
Judaism is connected with the structure of Jewish society and its articulation with the  
general society in the midst of which Jews lived in the 'classical' period. Here I merely  
want to observe that the profit motive is not characteristic of Judaism in all periods of  
its [[history]]. Only the platonist confusion which seeks for the metaphysical timeless  
'essence' of Judaism, instead of looking at the historical changes in Jewish society,  
has obscured this fact. (And this confusion has been greatly encouraged by zionism,  
in its reliance on 'historical rights' ahistorically derived from the Bible.) Thus,  
apologists of Judaism claim, quite correctly, that the Bible is hostile to the profit  
motive while the Talmud is indifferent to it. But this was caused by the very different  
social conditions in which they were composed. As was pointed out above, the  
Talmud was composed in two well-defined areas, in a period when the Jews living  
there constituted a society based on agriculture and consisting mainly of peasants -  
very different indeed from the society of classical Judaism.

In Chapter 5 we shall deal in detail with the hostile attitudes and deceptions  
practiced by classical Judaism against non-Jews. But more important as a social  
feature is the profit- motivated deception practiced by the rich Jews against poor  
fellow Jews (such as the dispensation concerning interest on loans). Here I must say,  
in spite of my opposition to marxism both in philosophy and as a social theory, that  
Marx was quite right when, in his two articles about Judaism, he characterized it as  
dominated by profit-seeking - provided this is limited to Judaism as he knew it, that  
is, to classical Judaism which in his youth had already entered the period of its  
dissolution. True, he stated this arbitrarily, ahistorically and without proof. Obviously  
he came to his conclusion by intuition; but his intuition in this case - and with the  
proper historical limitation - was right.

    Chapter 3
    

#### The Weight of History

A great deal of nonsense has been written in the attempt to provide a social or  
mystical interpretation of Jewry or Judaism 'as a whole'. This cannot be done, for the  
social structure of the Jewish people and the ideological structure of Judaism have  
changed profoundly through the ages. Four major phases can be distinguished:

(1) The phase of the ancient kingdoms of [[Israel]] and Judah, until the destruction  
the first Temple (587 BC) and the Babylonian exile. (Much of the Old Testament is  
concerned with this period, although most major books of the Old Testament,  
including the Pentateuch as we know it, were actually composed after that date.)  
Socially, these ancient Jewish kingdoms were quite similar to the neighboring  
kingdoms of Palestine and Syria; and - as a careful reading of the Prophets reveals -  
the similarity extended to the religious cults practiced by the great majority of the  
people. (1) The ideas that were to become typical of later Judaism - including in  
particular ethnic segregationism and monotheistic exclusivism - were at this stage  
confined to small circles of priests and prophets, whose social in[[flu]]ence depended on  
royal support.

(2) The phase of the dual centers, Palestine and Mesopotamia, from the first  
'Return from Babylon' (537 BC) until about AD 500. It is characterized by the  
existence of these two autonomous Jewish societies, both based primarily on  
agriculture, on which the 'Jewish religion', as previously elaborated in priestly and  
scribal circles, was imposed by the force and authority of the Persian [[empire]]. The Old  
Testament Book of Ezra contains an account of the activities of Ezra the priest, 'a  
ready scribe in the law of Moses', who was empowered by [[King]] Artaxerxes I of Persia  
to 'set magistrates and judges' over the Jews of Palestine, so that 'whosoever will not  
do the law of thy God, and the law of the king, let judgment be executed speedily  
upon him, whether it be unto [[death]], or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or  
to im[[prison]]ment’ (2) And in the Book of Neherniali - cupbearer to [[King]] Artaxerxes  
who was appointed Persian governor of Judea, with even greater powers - we see to  
what extent foreign (nowadays one would say 'imperialist') coercion was instru[[mental]]  
in imposing the Jewish religion, with lasting results.

###### \[51\]

In both centers, Jewish autonomy persisted during most of this period and  
deviations from religious orthodoxy were repressed. Exceptions to this rule occurred

when the religious aristocracy itself got 'infected' with Hellenistic ideas (from 300 to  
166 BC and again under Herod the [[Great]] and his successors, from 50 BC to AD 70),  
or when it was split in reaction to new developments (for example, the division  
between the two great parties, the Pharisees and the Sadduceans, which emerged in  
about 140 BC). However, the moment any one party triumphed, it used the coercive  
machinery of the Jewish autonomy (or, for a short period, independence) to impose  
its own religious views on all the Jews in both centers.

During most of this time, especially after the collapse of the Persian [[empire]] and  
until about AD 200, the Jews outside the two centers were free from Jewish religious  
coercion. Among the papyri preserved in Elephantine (in Upper [[Egypt]]) there is a  
letter dating from 419 BC containing the text of an edict by [[King]] Darius II of Persia  
which instructs the Jews of [[Egypt]] as to the details of the observance of Passover. (3)  
But the Hellenistic kingdoms, the [[Roma]]n Republic and early [[Roma]]n Empire did not  
bother with such things. The freedom that Hellenistic Jews enjoyed outside Palestine  
allowed the creation of a Jewish literature written in Greek, which was subsequently  
rejected in toto by Judaism and whose remains were preserved by Christianity. (4)  
The very rise of Christianity was possible because of this relative freedom of the  
Jewish communities outside the two centers. The experience of the Apostle Paul is  
significant: in Corinth, when the local Jewish community accused Paul of heresy, the  
[[Roma]]n governor Galho dismissed the case at once, refusing to be a 'judge of such  
matters'; (5) but in Judea the governor Festus felt obliged to take legal cognizance of  
a purely religious internal Jewish dispute. (6)

This tolerance came to an end in about AD 200, when the Jewish religion, as  
meanwhile elaborated and evolved in Palestine, was imposed by the [[Roma]]n  
authorities upon all the Jews of the Empire. (7)

(3) The phase which we have defined as classical Judaism and which will be  
discussed below. (8)

(4) The modern phase, characterized by the breakdown of the totalitarian  
Jewish community and its power, and by attempts to reimpose it, of which Zionism is  
the most important. This phase begins in Holland in the 17th century, in [[France]] and  
[[Austria]] (excluding [[Hungary]]) in the late 18th century, in most other [[Europe]]an  
countries in the middle of the 19th century, and

\[52\] in some Islamic countries in the 20th century. (The Jews of Yemen were still  
living in the medieval 'classical' phase in [[1948]]). Something concerning these  
developments will be said later on.

Between the second phase and the third, that of classical Judaism, there is a gap  
of several centuries in which our present knowledge of Jews and Jewish society is  
very slight, and the scant information we do have is all derived from external (non-  
Jewish) sources. In the countries of Latin Christendom we have absolutely no Jewish  
literary records until the middle of the 10th century; internal Jewish information,  
mostly from religious literature, becomes more abundant only in the 11th and  
particularly the 12th century. Before that, we are wholly dependent first on [[Roma]]n  
and then on Christian evidence. In the Islamic countries the information gap is not  
quite so big; still, very little is known about Jewish society before AD 800 and about  
the changes it must have undergone during the three preceding centuries.

Major Features of Classical Judaism

Let us therefore ignore those 'dark ages', and for the sake of convenience begin  
with the two centuries 1000-1200, for which abundant information is available from  
both internal and external sources on all the important Jewish centers, east and west.  
Classical Judaism, which is clearly discernible in this period, has undergone very few  
changes since then, and (in the guise of Orthodox Judaism) is still a powerful force  
today.

How can that classical Judaism be characterized, and what are the social  
differences distinguishing it from earlier phases of Judaism? I believe that there are  
three such major features.

1.  Classical Jewish society has no peasants, and in this it differs  
    profoundly from earlier Jewish societies in the two centers, Palestine and  
    Mesopotamia. It is difficult for us, in modern times, to understand what this means.  
    We have to make an effort to imagine what serfdom was like; the enormous  
    difference in literacy, let alone education, between village and town throughout this  
    period; the incomparably greater freedom enjoyed by all the small minority who were  
    not peasants - in order to realize that during the whole of the classical period the  
    Jews, in spite of all the persecutions to which they were subjected, formed an integral  
    part of the privileged classes. Jewish historiography, especially in English, is  
    misleading on this point inasmuch as it tends to focus on Jewish [[poverty]] and anti-  
    Jewish discrimination. Both were real enough at times; but the poorest Jewish  
    craftsman, peddler, land-lord's steward or petty cleric was immeasurably better off  
    than a

\[53\] serf. This was particularly true in those [[Europe]]an countries where serfdom  
persisted into the 19th century, whether in a partial or extreme form: Prussia, [[Austria]]  
(including [[Hungary]]), [[Poland]] and the Polish lands taken by [[Russia]]. And it is not  
without significance that, prior to the beginning of the great Jewish migration of  
modern times (around [[1880]]), a large majority of all Jews were living in those areas  
and that their most important social function there was to mediate the oppression of  
the peasants on behalf of the nobility and the [[Crown]].

Everywhere, classical Judaism developed hatred and contempt for agriculture  
as an occupation and for peasants as a class, even more than for other Gentiles - a  
hatred of which I know no parallel in other societies. This is immediately apparent to  
anyone who is familiar with the Yiddish or Hebrew literature of the 19th and 20th  
centuries. (9)

Most east-[[Europe]]an Jewish socialists (that is, members of exclusively or  
predominantly Jewish parties and factions) are guilty of never pointing out this fact;  
indeed, many were themselves tainted with a ferocious anti-peasant attitude  
inherited from classical Judaism. Of course, Zionist 'socialists' were the worst in this  
respect, but others, such as the Bund, were not much better. A typical example is  
their opposition to the formation of peasant co-operatives promoted by the Catholic  
clergy, on the ground that this was 'an act of antisemitism'. This attitude is by no

means dead even now; it could be seen very clearly in the racist views held by many  
Jewish 'dissidents' in the USSR regarding the [[Russia]]n people, and also in the lack of  
discussion of this background by so many Jewish socialists, such as Isaac Deutscher.  
The whole racist propaganda on the theme of the supposed superiority of Jewish  
morality and intellect (in which many Jewish socialists were prominent) is bound up  
with a lack of sensitivity for the suffering of that major part of humanity who were  
especially oppressed during the last thousand years - the peasants.

2.  Classical Jewish society was particularly dependent on kings or on  
    nobles with royal powers. In the next chapter we discuss various Jewish laws  
    directed against Gentiles, and in particular laws which command Jews to revile  
    Gentiles and refrain from praising them or their customs. These laws allow one and  
    only one exception: a Gentile king, or a locally powerful magnate (in Hebrew paritz,  
    in Yiddish pooretz). A king is praised and prayed for, and he is obeyed not only in  
    most civil matters but also in some religious ones. As we shall see Jewish doctors,  
    who are in general forbidden to save the lives of ordinary Gentiles on the Sabbath, are  
    commanded to do their utmost in healing magnates and rulers;

\[54\] this partly explains why kings and noblemen, popes and bishops often employed  
Jewish physicians. But not only physicians. Jewish tax and customs collectors, or (in  
eastern [[Europe]]) bailiffs of manors could be depended upon to do their utmost for the  
king or baron, in a way that a Christian could not always be.

The legal status of a Jewish community in the period of classical Judaism was  
normally based on a 'privilege' - a charter granted by a king or prince (or, in [[Poland]]  
after the 16th century, by a powerful nobleman) to the Jewish community and  
conferring on it the rights of autonomy - that is, investing the rabbis with the power  
to dictate to the other Jews. An important part of such privileges, going as far back as  
the late [[Roma]]n Empire, is the creation of a Jewish clerical estate which, exactly like  
the Christian clergy in medieval times, is exempt from paying taxes to the  
sovereign and is allowed to impose taxes on the people under its control - the Jews -  
for its own benefit. It is interesting to note that this deal between the late [[Roma]]n  
Empire and the rabbis antedates by at least one hundred years the very similar  
privileges granted by Constantine the [[Great]] and his successors to the Christian clergy.

From about AD 200 until the early 5th century, the legal position of Jewry in the  
[[Roma]]n Empire was as follows. A hereditary Jewish Patriarch (residing in Tiberias in  
Palestine) was recognized both as a high dignitary in the official hierarchy of the  
Empire and as supreme chief of all the Jews in the Empire. (10) As a [[Roma]]n official,  
the Patriarch was vir illustris, of the same high official class which included the  
consuls, the top military commanders of the Empire and the chief ministers around  
the throne (the Sacred Consistory), and was out-ranked only by the imperial family.  
In fact, the Illustrious Patriarch (as he is invariably styled in imperial decrees) out-  
ranked the provincial governor of Palestine. Emperor Theodosius I, the [[Great]], a pious  
and orthodox Christian, executed his governor of Palestine for insulting the  
Patriarch.

At the same time, all the rabbis - who had to be designated by the Patriarch -  
were freed from the most oppressive [[Roma]]n taxes and received many official  
privileges, such as exemption from serving on town councils (which was also one of

the first privileges later granted to the Christian clergy). In addition, the Patriarch  
was empowered to tax the Jews and to discipline them by imposing fines, flogging  
and other punishments. He used this power in order to suppress Jewish heresies and  
(as we know from the Talmud) to persecute Jewish preachers who accused him of  
taxing the Jewish poor for his personal benefit.

    We know from Jewish sources that the tax-exempt rabbis
    

\[55\] used excommunication and other means within their power to enhance the  
religious hegemony of the Patriarch. We also hear, mostly indirectly, of the hate and  
s[[corn]] that many of the Jewish peasants and urban poor in Palestine had for the  
rabbis, as well as of the contempt of the rabbis for the Jewish poor (usually expressed  
as contempt for the 'ignorant'). Nevertheless, this typical colonial arrangement  
continued, as it was backed by the might of the [[Roma]]n Empire.

Similar arrangements existed, within each country, during the whole period of  
classical Judaism. Their social effects on the Jewish communities differed, however,  
according to the size of each community. Where there were few Jews, there was  
normally little social differentiation within the community, which tended to be  
composed of rich and middle~lass Jews, most of whom had considerable rabbinical-  
talmudic education. But in countries where the number of Jews increased and a big  
class of Jewish poor appeared, the same cleavage as the one described above  
manifested itself, and we observe the rabbinical class, in [[alliance]] with the Jewish rich,  
oppressing the Jewish poor in its own interest as well as in the interest of the state -  
that is, of the [[Crown]] and the nobility.

This was, in particular, the situation in pre-[[1795]] [[Poland]]. The specific  
circumstances of Polish Jewry will be outlined below. Here I only want to point out  
that because of the formation of a large Jewish community in that country, a deep  
cleavage between the Jewish upper class (the rabbis and the rich) and the Jewish  
masses developed there from the 18th century and continued throughout the 19th  
century. So long as the Jewish community had power over its members, the incipient  
revolts of the poor, who had to bear the main brunt of taxation, were suppressed by  
the combined force of the naked coercion of Jewish 'self-rule' and religious sanction.

Because of all this, throughout the classical period (as well as in modern times)  
the rabbis were the most loyal, not to say Zealous, supporters of the powers that be;  
and the more reactionary the regime, the more rabbinical support it had.

3.  The society of classical Judaism is in total opposition to the  
    surrounding non-Jewish society, except the king (or the nobles, when  
    they take over the state). This is amply illustrated in Chapter 5.

The consequences of these three social features, taken together, go a long way  
towards explaining the [[history]] of classical Jewish communities both in Christian and  
in Muslim countries.

The position of the Jews is particularly favorable under strong regimes which  
have retained a feudal character, and in which national consciousness, even at a

rudimentary level, has

\[56\] not yet begun to develop. It is even more favorable in countries such as pre-[[1795]]  
[[Poland]] or in the Iberian kingdoms before the latter half of the 15th century, where the  
formation of a nationally based powerful feudal monarchy was temporarily or  
permanently arrested. In fact, classical Judaism flourishes best under strong regimes  
which are dissociated from most classes in society, and in such regimes the Jews  
fulfill one of the functions of a middle class - but in a permanently dependent form.  
For this reason they are opposed not only by the peasantry (whose opposition is then  
unimportant, except for the occasional and rare popular revolt) but more importantly  
by the non-Jewish middle class (which was on the rise in [[Europe]]), and by the  
plebeian part of the clergy; and they are protected by the upper clergy and the  
nobility. But in those countries where, feudal anarchy having been curbed, the  
nobility enters into partnership with the king (and with at least part of the  
bourgeoisie) to rule the state, which assumes a national or protonational form, the  
position of the Jews deteriorates.

This general scheme, valid for Muslim and Christian countries alike, will now be  
illustrated briefly by a few examples.

England, [[France]] and [[Italy]]

Since the first period of Jewish residence in England was so brief, and coincided  
with the development of the English national feudal monarchy, this country can serve  
as the best illustration of the above scheme. Jews were brought over to England by  
William the Conqueror, as part of the [[French]]-speaking Norman ruling class, with the  
primary duty of granting loans to those lords, spiritual and temporal, who were  
otherwise unable to pay their feudal dues (which were particularly heavy in England  
and more rigorously exacted in that period than in any other [[Europe]]an monarchy).  
Their greatest royal patron was Henry II, and the Magna Carta marked the beginning  
of their decline, which continued during the conflict of the barons with Henry III. The  
temporary resolution of this conflict by Edward I, with the formation of Parliament  
and of 'ordinary' and fixed taxation, was accompanied by the expulsion of the Jews.

Similarly, in [[France]] the Jews flourished during the formation of the strong  
feudal principalities in the 11th and 12th centuries, including the Royal Domain; and  
their best protector among the Capetian kings was Louis VII (1137-80).  
notwithstanding his deep and sincere Christian piety. At that time the Jews of [[France]]  
counted themselves as knights (in Hebrew, parashim) and the leading Jewish  
authority in [[France]], Rabbenu Tam, warns them never to accept an invitation by a

\[57\] feudal lord to settle on his domain, unless they are accorded privileges similar to  
those of other knights. The decline in their position beings with Philip II [[August]]us,  
originator of the political and military [[alliance]] of the [[Crown]] with the rising urban  
commune movement, and plummets under Philip IV the Handsome, who convoked  
the first Estates General for the whole of [[France]] in order to gain support against the  
pope. The final expulsion of Jews from the whole of [[France]] is closely bound up with  
the firm establishment of the [[Crown]]'s rights of taxation and the national character of  
the monarchy.

Similar examples can be given from other [[Europe]]an countries where Jews were  
living during that period. Reserving Christian [[Spain]] and [[Poland]] for a more detailed  
discussion, we remark that in [[Italy]], where many city states had a republican form of  
power, the same regularity is discernible. Jews flourished especially in the Papal  
[[States]], in the twin feudal kingdoms of Sicily and Naples (until their expulsion, on  
[[Spanish]] orders, circa [[1500]]) and in the feudal enclaves of Piedmont. But in the great  
commercial and independent cities such as Florence their number was small and  
their social role unimportant.

The Muslim World

The same general scheme applies to Jewish communities during the classical  
period in Muslim countries as well, except for the important fact that expulsion of  
Jews, being contrary to Islamic law, was virtually unknown there. (Medieval Catholic  
canon law, on the other hand, neither commands nor forbids such expulsion.)

Jewish communities flourished in the famous, but socially misinterpreted,  
Jewish Golden Age in Muslim countries under regimes which were particularly  
dissociated from the great majority of the people they ruled, and whose power rested  
on nothing but naked force and a mercenary army. The best example is Muslim  
[[Spain]], where the very real Jewish Golden Age (of Hebrew poetry, grammar,  
philosophy etc) begins precisely with the fall of the [[Spanish]] Umayyad caliphate after  
the [[death]] of the de facto ruler, al-Mansur, in 1002, and the establishment of the  
numerous ta'ifa (faction) kingdoms, all based on naked force. The rise of the famous  
Jewish commander-in-chief and prime minister of the kingdom of Granada, Samuel  
the Chief (Shmu'el Hannagid, died 1056), who was also one of the greatest Hebrew  
poets of all ages, was based primarily on the fact that the kingdom which he served  
was a tyranny of a rather small Berber military force over the Arabic-speaking  
inhabitants. A similar situation obtained in the other ta'ifa

\[58\] Arab-[[Spanish]] kingdoms. The position of the Jews declined somewhat with the  
establishment of the Almoravid regime (in 1086-90) and became quite precarious  
under the strong and popular Almohad regime (after 1147) when, as a result of  
persecutions, the Jews migrated to the Christian [[Spanish]] kingdoms, where the power  
of the kings was still very slight.

Similar observations can be made regarding the states of the Muslim East. The  
first state in which the Jewish community reached a position of important political  
in[[flu]]ence was the Fatimid [[empire]], especially after the conquest of [[Egypt]] in 969,  
because it was based on the rule of an Isma'ili-shi'ite religious minority. The same  
phenomenon can be observed in the Seljuk states - based on feudal-type armies,  
mercenaries and, increasingly, on slave troops (mamluks) - and in their successor  
states. The favor of Saladin to the Jewish communities, first in [[Egypt]], then in other  
parts of this expanding [[empire]], was based not only on his real personal qualities of  
tolerance, charity and deep political wisdom, but equally on his rise to power as a  
rebellious commander of mercenaries freshly arrived in [[Egypt]] and then as usurper of  
the power of the dynasty which he and his father and uncle before him had served.

But perhaps the best Islamic example is the state where the Jews' position was  
better than anywhere else in the East since the fall of the ancient Persian [[empire]] - the

Ottoman [[empire]], particularly during its heyday in the 16th century. (11) As is well  
known, the Ottoman regime was based initially on the almost complete exclusion of  
the Turks themselves (not to mention other Muslims by birth) from positions of  
political power and from the most important part of the army, the Janissary corps,  
both of which were manned by the sultan's Christian-born [[slaves]], abducted in  
[[child]]hood and educated in special schools. Until the end of the 16th century no free-  
born Turk could become a Janissary or hold any important [[government]] office. In  
such a regime, the role of the Jews in their sphere was quite analogous to that of the  
Janissaries in theirs. Thus the position of the Jews was best under a regime which  
was politically most dissociated from the peoples it ruled. With the admission of the  
Turks themselves (as well as some other Muslim peoples, such as the Albanians) to  
the ruling class of the Ottoman [[empire]], the position of the Jews declines. However,  
this decline was not very sharp, because of the continuing arbitrariness and non-  
national character of the Ottoman regime.

This point is very important, in my opinion, because the relatively good  
situation of Jews under Islam in general, and under certain Islamic regimes in  
particular, is used by many Palestinian and other Arab propagandists in a very  
ignorant,

\[59\] albeit perhaps well-meaning, way. First, they generalize and reduce serious  
questions of politics and [[history]] to mere slogans. Granted that the position of Jews  
was, on average, much better under Islam than under Christianity - the important  
question to ask is, under what regimes was it better or worse? We have seen where  
such an analysis leads.

But, secondly and more importantly: in a pre-modern state, a 'better' position of  
the Jewish community normally entailed a greater degree of tyranny exercised within  
this community by the rabbis against other Jews. To give one example: certainly, the  
figure of Saladin is one which, considering his period, inspires profound respect. But  
together with this respect, I for one cannot forget that the enhanced privileges he  
granted to the Jewish community in [[Egypt]] and his appointment of Maimonides as  
their Chief (Nagid) immediately unleashed severe religious persecution of Jewish  
'sinners' by the rabbis. For instance, Jewish 'priests' (supposed descendants of the  
ancient priests who had served in the Temple) are forbidden to marry not only  
prostitutes (12) but also divorcees. This latter prohibition, which has always caused  
difficulties, was infringed during the anarchy under the last Fatimid rulers (circa  
1130-80) by such 'priests' who, contrary to Jewish religious law, were married to  
Jewish divorcees in Islamic courts (which are nominally empowered to marry non-  
Muslims). The greater tolerance towards 'the Jews' instituted by Saladin upon his  
accession to power enabled Maimonides to issue orders to the rabbinical courts in  
[[Egypt]] to seize all Jews who had gone through such forbidden marriages and have  
them flogged until they 'agreed' to divorce their wives. (13) Similarly, in the Ottoman  
[[empire]] the powers of the rabbinical courts were very great and consequently most  
pernicious. Therefore the position of Jews in Muslim countries in the past should  
never be used as a political argument in contemporary (or future) contexts.

Christian [[Spain]]

I have left to the last a discussion of the two countries where the position of the  
Jewish community and the internal development of classical Judaism were most  
important - Christian [[Spain]] (14) (or rather the Iberian peninsula, including [[Portugal]])  
and pre-[[1795]] [[Poland]].

Politically, the position of Jews in the Christian [[Spanish]] kingdoms was the  
highest ever attained by Jews in any country (except some of the ta'ifas and under the  
Fatimids) before the 19th century. Many Jews served officially as Treasurers General

\[60\] to the kings of Castile, regional and general tax collectors, diplomats  
(representing their king in foreign courts, both Muslim and Christian, even outside  
[[Spain]]), courtiers and advisers to rulers and great noblemen. And in no other country  
except [[Poland]] did the Jewish community wield such great legal powers over the Jews  
or used them so widely and publicly, including the power to inflict capital  
punishment. From the 11th century the persecution of Karaites (a heretical Jewish  
sect) by flogging them to [[death]] if unrepentant was common in Castile. Jewish women  
who cohabited with Gentiles had their noses cut off by rabbis who explained that 'in  
this way she will lose her beauty and her non-Jewish lover will come to hate her'.  
Jews who had the effrontery to attack a rabbinical judge had their hands cut off.  
Adulterers were im[[prison]]ed, after being made to run the gauntlet through the Jewish  
quarter. In religious disputes, those thought to be heretics had their tongues cut out.

Historically, all this was associated with feudal anarchy and with the attempt of  
a few 'strong' kings to rule through sheer force, disregarding the [[parliament]]ary  
institutions, the Cortes, which had already come into existence. In this struggle, not  
only the political and financial power of the Jews but also their military power (at  
least in the most important kingdom, Castile) was very significant. One example will  
suffice: both feudal mis- [[government]] and Jewish political in[[flu]]ence in Castile reached  
their peak under Pedro I, justly nick-named the Cruel. The Jewish communities of  
Toledo, Burgos and many other cities served practically as his garrisons in the long  
civil war between him and his half-brother, Henry of Trastamara, who after his  
victory became Henry II (1369~79). (15) The same Pedro I gave the Jews of Castile  
the right to establish a country-wide inquisition against Jewish religious deviants -  
more than one hundred years before the establishment of the more famous Catholic  
Holy Inquisition.

As in other western [[Europe]]an countries, the gradual emergence of national  
consciousness around the monarchy, which began under the house of Trastamara  
and after ups and downs reached a culmination under the Catholic [[King]]s Ferdinand  
and Isabella, was accompanied first by a decline in the position of the Jews, then by  
popular movements and pressures against them and finally by their expulsion. On the  
whole the Jews were defended by the nobility and upper clergy. It was the more  
plebeian sections of the church, particularly the mendicant orders, involved in the life  
of the lower classes, which were hostile to them. The great enemies of the Jews,  
Torquemada and [[Cardinal]] Ximenes, were also great reformers of the [[Spanish]] church,  
making it much less corrupt and much more dependent

\[61\] on the monarchy instead of being the preserve of the feudal aristocracy.

[[Poland]]

The old pre-[[1795]] [[Poland]] - a feudal republic with an elective king- is a converse  
example; it illustrates how before the advent of the modern state the position of the  
Jews was socially most important, and their internal autonomy greatest, under a  
regime which was completely retarded to the point of utter degeneracy.

Due to many causes, medieval [[Poland]] lagged in its development behind  
countries like England and [[France]]; a strong feudal-type monarchy - yet without any  
[[parliament]]ary institutions - was formed there only in the 14th century, especially  
under Casimir the [[Great]] (1333-70). Immediately after his [[death]], changes of dynasty  
and other factors led to a very rapid development of the power of the noble magnates,  
then also of the petty nobility, so that by [[1572]] the process of reduction of the king to a  
figure head and exclusion of all other non-noble estates from political power was  
virtually complete. In the following two hundred years, the lack of [[government]] turned  
into an acknowledged anarchy, to the point where a court decision in a case affecting  
a nobleman was only a legal license to wage a private war to enforce the verdict (for  
there was no other way to enforce it) and where feuds between great noble houses in  
the 18th century involved private armies numbering tens of thousands, much larger  
than the derisory forces of the official army of the Republic.

This process was accompanied by a debasement in the position of the Polish  
peasants (who had been free in the early Middle Ages) to the point of utter serfdom,  
hardly distinguishable from outright [[slavery]] and certainly the worst in [[Europe]]. The  
desire of noblemen in neighboring countries to enjoy the power of the Polish pan over  
his peasants (including the power of life and [[death]] without any right of appeal) was  
instru[[mental]] in the territorial expansion of [[Poland]]. The situation in the 'eastern'  
lands of [[Poland]] (Byelorussia and the [[Ukraine]]) - colonized and settled by newly  
enserfed peasants - was worst of all. (16)

A small number of Jews (albeit in important positions) had apparently been  
living in [[Poland]] since the creation of the Polish state. A significant Jewish  
immigration into that country began in the 13th century and increased under Casimir  
the [[Great]], with the decline in the Jewish position in western and then in central  
[[Europe]]. Not very much is known about Polish Jewry in

\[62\] that period. But with the decline of the monarchy in the 16th century -  
particularly under Sigismund I the Old ([[1506]]-45) and his son Sigismund II [[August]]us  
([[1548]]-72) - Polish Jewry burst into social and political prominence accompanied, as  
usual, with a much greater degree of autonomy. It was at this time that [[Poland]]'s Jews  
were granted their greatest privileges, culminating in the establishment of the famous  
Committee of Four Lands, a very effective autonomous Jewish organ of rule and  
jurisdiction over all the Jews in [[Poland]]'s four divisions. One of its many important  
functions was to collect all the taxes from Jews all over the country, deducting part of  
the yield for its own use and for the use of local Jewish communities, and passing the  
rest on to the state treasury.

What was the social role of Polish Jewry from the beginning of the 16th century  
until [[1795]]? With the decline of royal power, the king's usual role in relation to the  
Jews was rapidly taken over by the nobility - with lasting and tragic results both for  
the Jews themselves and for the common people of the Polish republic. All over  
[[Poland]] the nobles used Jews as their agents to undermine the commercial power of

the Royal Towns, which were weak in any case. Alone among the countries of western  
Christendom, in [[Poland]] a nobleman's [[property]] inside a Royal Town was exempt from  
the town's laws and guild regulations. In most cases the nobles settled their Jewish  
clients in such properties, thus giving rise to a lasting conflict. The Jews were usually  
'victorious', in the sense that the towns could neither subjugate nor drive them off;  
but in the frequent popular riots Jewish lives (and, even more, Jewish [[property]]) were  
lost. The nobles still got the profits. Similar or worse consequences followed from the  
frequent use of Jews as commercial agents of noblemen: they won exemption from  
most Polish tolls and tariffs, to the loss of the native bourgeoisie.

But the most lasting and tragic results occurred in the eastern provinces of  
[[Poland]] - roughly, the area east of the present border, including almost the whole of  
the present [[Ukraine]] and reaching up to the [[Great]]-[[Russia]]n language frontier. (Until  
[[1667]] the Polish border was far east of the Dnieper, so that Poltava, for example, was  
inside [[Poland]].) In those wide territories there were hardly any Royal Towns. The  
towns were established by nobles and belonged to them - and they were settled  
almost exclusively by Jews. Until [[1939]], the population of many Polish towns east of  
the river Bug was at least 90 per cent Jewish, and this demographic phenomenon was  
even more pronounced in that area of Tsarist [[Russia]] annexed from [[Poland]] and  
Icnown as the Jewish Pale. Outside the towns very many Jews throughout [[Poland]],  
but especially in the east, were

\[63\] employed as the direct supervisors and oppressors of the enserfed peasantry - as  
bailiffs of whole manors (invested with the landlord's full coercive powers) or as  
lessees of particular feudal monopolies such as the [[corn]] mill, the liquor still and  
public house (with the right of armed search of peasant houses for illicit stills) or the  
bakery, and as collectors of customary feudal dues of all kinds. In short, in eastern  
[[Poland]], under the rule of the nobles (and of the feudalized church, formed exclusively  
from the nobility) the Jews were both the immediate exploiters of the  
peasantry and virtually the only town-dwellers.

No doubt, most of the profit they extracted from the peasants was passed on to  
the landlords, in one way or another. No doubt, the oppression and subjugation of the  
Jews by the nobles were severe, and the historical record tells many a harrowing tale  
of the hardship and humiliation inflicted by noblemen on 'their' Jews. But, as we have  
remarked, the peasants suffered worse oppression at the hands of both landlords and  
Jews; and one may assume that, except in times of peasant uprisings, the full weight  
of the Jewish religious laws against Gentiles fell upon the peasants. As will be seen in  
the next chapter, these laws are suspended or mitigated in cases where it is feared  
that they might arouse dangerous hostility towards Jews; but the hostility of the  
peasants could be disregarded as ineffectual so long as the Jewish bailiff could shelter  
under the 'peace' of a great lord.

The situation stagnated until the advent of the modern state, by which time  
[[Poland]] had been dismembered. Therefore [[Poland]] was the only big country in western  
Christendom from which the Jews were never expelled. A new middle class could not  
arise out of the utterly enslaved peasantry; and the old bourgeoisie was  
geographically limited and commercially weak, and therefore powerless. Overall,  
matters got steadily worse, but without any substantial change.

Internal conditions within the Jewish community moved in a similar course. In  
the period [[1500]]-[[1795]], one of the most superstition-ridden in the [[history]] of Judaism,  
Polish Jewry was the most superstitious and fanatic of all Jewish communities. The  
considerable power of the Jewish autonomy was used increasingly to stifle all original  
or innovative thought, to promote the most shameless exploitation of the Jewish poor  
by the Jewish rich in [[alliance]] with the rabbis, and to justify~ the Jews' role in the  
oppression of the peasants in the service of the nobles. Here, too, there was no way  
out except by [[liberation]] from the outside. Pre-[[1795]] [[Poland]], where the social role of  
the Jews was more important than in any other classical diaspora, illustrates better  
than any other country the bankruptcy of classical Judaism.

###### \[64\]

Anti-Jewish Persecutions

During the whole period of classical Judaism, Jews were often subjected to  
persecutions (17) - and this fact now serves as the main 'argument' of the apologists of  
the Jewish religion with its anti-Gentile laws and especially of Zionism. Of course, the  
Nazi extermination of five to six million [[Europe]]an Jews is supposed to be the  
crowning argument in that line. We must therefore consider this phenomenon and its  
contemporary aspect. This is particularly important in view of the fact that the  
descendants of the Jews of pre-[[1795]] [[Poland]] (often called east-[[Europe]]an Jews' - as  
opposed to Jews from the German cultural domain of the early 19th century,  
including the present [[Austria]], Bohemia and Moravia) now wield predominant  
political power in [[Israel]] as well as in the Jewish communities in the [[USA]] and other  
English-speaking countries; and, because of their particular past [[history]], this mode.  
of thinking is especially entrenched among them, much more than among other Jews.

We must, first, draw a sharp distinction between the persecutions of' Jews  
during the classical period on the one hand, and the Nazi extermination on the other.  
The former were popular movements, coming from below; whereas the latter was  
inspired, organized and carried out from above: indeed, by state officials. Such acts as  
the Nazi state- organized extermination are relatively rare in human [[history]], although  
other cases do exist (the extermination of the Tasmanians and several other colonial  
peoples, for example). Moreover, the Nazis intended to wipe out other peoples  
besides the Jews: Gypsies were exterminated like Jews, and the extermination of  
Slavs was well under way, with the systematic massacre of millions of civilians and  
[[prison]]ers of war. However, it is the recurrent persecution of Jews in so many  
countries during the classical period which is the model (and the excuse) for the  
zionist politicians in their persecution of the Palestinians, as well as the argument  
used by apologists of Judaism in general; and it is this phenomenon which we  
consider now.

It must be pointed out that in all the worst anti-Jewish persecutions, that is,  
where Jews were [[kill]]ed, the ruling elite - the emperor and the pope, the kings, the  
higher aristocracy and the upper clergy, as well as the rich bourgeoisie in the  
autonomous cities - were always on the side of the Jews. The latter's enemies  
belonged to the more oppressed and exploited classes and those close to them in daily  
life and interests, such as the friars of the mendicant orders. (18) It is true that

\[65\] in most (but I think not in all) cases members of the elite defended the Jews  
neither out of considerations of humanity nor because of sympathy to the Jews as  
such, but for the type of reason used generally by rulers in justification of their  
interests - the fact that the Jews were useful and profitable (to them), defense of 'law  
and order', hatred of the lower classes and fear that anti-Jewish riots might develop  
into general popular [[rebellion]]. Still, the fact remains that they did defend the Jews.  
For this reason all the massacres of Jews during the classical period were part of a  
peasant [[rebellion]] or other popular movements at times when the [[government]] was for  
some reason especially weak. This is true even in the partly exceptional case of Tsarist  
[[Russia]]. The Tsarist [[government]], acting surreptitiously through its secret police, did  
promote pogroms; but it did so only when it was particularly weak (after the  
[[assassination]] of Alexander II in [[1881]], and in the period immediately before and after  
the [[1905]] [[revolution]]) and even then took care to contain the break~down of 'law and  
order'. During the time of its greatest strength - for example, under Nicholas I or in  
the latter part of the reign of Alexander III, when the opposition had been smashed -  
pogroms were not tolerated by the Tsarist regime, although legal discrimination  
against Jews was intensified.

The general rule can be observed in all the major massacres of Jews in Christian  
[[Europe]]. During the first crusade, it was not the proper armies of the knights,  
commanded by famous dukes and counts, which molested the Jews, but the  
spontaneous popular hosts composed almost exclusively of peasants and paupers in  
the wake of Peter the Hermit. In each city the bishop or the emperor's [[representative]]  
opposed them and tried, often in vain, to protect the Jews. (19) The anti-Jewish riots  
in England which accompanied the third crusade were part of a popular movement  
directed also against royal officials, and some rioters were punished by Richard I. The  
massacres of Jews during the outbreaks of the Black Death occurred against the strict  
orders of the pope, the emperor, the bishops and the German princes. In the free  
towns, for example in Strasbourg, they were usually preceded by a local [[revolution]] in  
which the oligarchic town council, which protected the Jews, was overthrown and  
replaced by a more popular one. The great 1391 massacres of Jews in [[Spain]] took place  
under a feeble regency [[government]] and at a time when the papacy, weakened by the  
[[Great]] Schism between competing popes, was unable to control the mendicant friars.

Perhaps the most outstanding example is the great massacre of Jews during the  
Chmielnicki revolt in the [[Ukraine]]

\[66\] ([[1648]]), which started as a mutiny of Cossack officers but soon turned into a  
widespread popular movement of the oppressed serfs: 'The unprivileged, the  
subjects, the Ukrainians, the Orthodox \[persecuted by the Polish Catholic church\]  
were rising against their Catholic Polish masters, particularly against their masters'  
bailiffs, clergy and Jews. (20) This typical peasant uprising against extreme  
oppression, an uprising accompanied not only by massacres committed by the rebels  
but also by even more horrible atrocities and 'counter-terror' of the Polish magnates'  
private armies, (21) has remained emblazoned in the consciousness of east-[[Europe]]an  
Jews to this very day - not, however, as a peasant uprising, a revolt of the oppressed,  
of the real wretched of the earth, nor even as a vengeance visited upon all the servants  
of the Polish nobility, but as an act of gratuitous antisemitism directed against Jews  
as such. In fact, the voting of the Ukrainian delegation at the UN and, more generally,  
[[Soviet]] policies on the Middle East, are often 'explained' in the [[Israel]]i press as 'a

heritage of Chmielnicki' or of his 'descendants'.

Modem Antisemitism

The character of anti-Jewish persecutions underwent a radical change in  
modern times. With the advent of the modern state, the abolition of serfdom and the  
achievement of minimal individual rights, the special socio-economic function of the  
Jews necessarily disappears. Along with it disappear also the powers of the Jewish  
community over its members; individual Jews in growing numbers win the freedom  
to enter the general society of their countries. Naturally, this transition aroused a  
violent reaction both on the part of Jews (especially their rabbis) and of those  
elements in [[Europe]]an society who opposed the open society and for whom the whole  
process of [[liberation]] of the individual was anathema.

Modern antisemitism appears first in [[France]] and Germany, then in [[Russia]], after  
about [[1870]]. Contrary to the prevalent opinion among Jewish socialists, I do not  
believe that its beginnings or its subsequent development until the present day can be  
ascribed to 'capitalism'. On the contrary, in my opinion the successful capitalists in all  
countries were on the whole remarkably free from antisemitism, and the countries in  
which capitalism was established first and in its most extensive form - such as  
England and Belgium - were also those where antisemitism was far less widespread  
than elsewhere. (22)

Early modern antisemitism ([[1880]]-[[1900]]) was a reaction of bewildered men, who  
deeply hated modern society in all its

\[67\] aspects, both good and bad, and who were ardent believers in the conspiracy  
theory of [[history]]. The Jews were cast in the role of scapegoat for the breakup of the  
old society (which anti-semitic nostalgia imagined as even more closed and ordered  
than it had ever been in reality) and for all that was disturbing in modern times. But  
right at the start the antisemites were faced with what was, for them, a difficult  
problem: how to define this scapegoat, particularly in popular terms? What is to be  
the supposed common denominator of the Jewish musician, banker, craftsman and  
beggar - especially after the common religious features had largely dissolved, at least  
externally? The 'theory' of the Jewish race was the modern antisemitic answer to this  
problem.

In contrast, the old Christian, and even more so Muslim opposition to classical  
Judaism was remarkably free from [[racism]]. No doubt this was to some extent a  
consequence of the universal character of Christianity and Islam, as well as of their  
original connection with Judaism (St Thomas More repeatedly rebuked a woman who  
objected when he told her that the Virgin Mary was Jewish). But in my opinion a far  
more important reason was the social role of the Jews as an integral part of the upper  
classes. In many countries Jews were treated as potential nobles and, upon  
conversion, were able immediately to intermarry with the highest nobility. The  
nobility of 15th century Castile and Aragon or the aristocracy of 18th century [[Poland]] -  
to take the two cases where intermarriage with converted Jews was widespread -  
would hardly be likely to marry [[Spanish]] peasants or Polish serfs, no matter how  
much praise the Gospel has for the poor.

It is the modern myth of the Jewish 'race' - of outwardly hidden but supposedly  
dominant characteristics of 'the Jews', independent of [[history]], of social role, of  
anything - which is the formal and most important distinguishing mark of modern  
antisemitism. This was in fact perceived by some Church leaders when modern  
antisemitism first appeared as a movement of some strength. Some [[French]] Catholic  
leaders, for example, opposed the new racist doctrine expounded by E. Drumont, the  
first popular modern [[French]] antisemite and author of the notorious book La [[France]]  
Juive ([[1886]]), which achieved wide circulation. (23) Early modern German  
antisemites encountered similar opposition.

It must be pointed out that some important groups of [[Europe]]an conservatives  
were quite prepared to play along with modern antisemitism and use it for their own  
ends, and the antisemites were equally ready to use the conservatives when the  
occasion offered itself, although at bottom there was little

\[68\] similarity between the two parties. 'The victims who were most harshly treated  
\[by the pen of the above-mentioned Drumont\] were not the Roths[[child]]s but the great  
nobles who courted them. Drumont did not spare the Royal Family ... or the bishops,  
or for that matter the [[Pope]]. (24) Nevertheless, many of the [[French]] great nobles,  
bishops and conservatives generally were quite happy to use Drumont and  
antisemitism during the crisis of the Dreyfus affair in an attempt to bring down the  
republican regime.

This type of opportunistic [[alliance]] reappeared many times in various [[Europe]]an  
countries until the defeat of Nazism. The conservatives' hatred of radicalism and  
especially of all forms of socialism blinded many of them to the nature of their  
political bedfellows. In many cases they were literally prepared to ally themselves  
with the devil, forgetting the old saying that one needs a very long spoon to sup with  
him.

The effectiveness of modern antisemitism, and of its [[alliance]] with conservatism,  
depended on several factors.

First, the older tradition of Christian religious opposition to Jews, which existed  
in many (though by no means all) [[Europe]]an countries, could, if supported or at least  
unopposed by the clergy, be harnessed to the antisemitic bandwagon. The actual  
response of the clergy in each country was largely determined by specific local  
historical and social circumstances. In the Catholic Church, the tendency for an  
opportunistic [[alliance]] with antisemitism was strong in [[France]] but not in [[Italy]]; in  
[[Poland]] and Slovakia but not in Bohemia. The Greek Orthodox Church had notorious  
antisemitic tendencies in [[[[Roma]]nia]] but took the opposite line in Bulgaria. Among the  
Protestant Churches, the German was deeply divided on this issue, others (such as  
the Latvian and Estonian) tended to be antisemitic, but many (for example the [[Dutch]],  
Swiss and Scandinavian) were among the earliest to condemn antisemitism.

Secondly, antisemitism was largely a generic expression of xenophobia, a desire  
for a 'pure' homogeneous society. But in many [[Europe]]an countries around [[1900]] (and  
in fact until quite recently) the Jew was virtually the only 'stranger'. This was  
particularly true of Germany. In principle, the German racists of the early 20th  
century hated and despised Blacks just as much as Jews; but there were no Blacks in

Germany then. Hate is of course much more easily focused on the present than on the  
absent, especially under the conditions of the time, when mass travel and tourism did  
not exist and most [[Europe]]ans never left their own country in peacetime.

Thirdly, the successes of the tentative [[alliance]] between conservatism and  
antisemitism were inversely proportional to the

\[69\] power and capabilities of its opponents. And the consistent and effective  
opponents of antisemitism in [[Europe]] are the political forces of liberalism and  
socialism - historically the same forces that continue in various ways the tradition  
symbolized by the [[War]] of [[Dutch]] Independence ([[1568]]-[[1648]]), the English Revolution  
and the [[Great]] [[French]] Revolution. On the [[Europe]]an continent the main shibboleth is  
the attitude towards the [[Great]] [[French]] Revolution - roughly speaking. those who are  
for it are against antisemitism; those who accept it with regret would be at least prone  
to an [[alliance]] with the antisemites; those who hate it and would like to undo its  
achievements are the milieu from which antisemitism develops.

Nevertheless, a sharp distinction must be made between conservatives and even  
reactionaries on the one hand and actual racists and antisemites on the other.  
Modern [[racism]] (of which antisemitism is part) although caused by specific social  
conditions, becomes, when it gains strength, a force that in my opinion can only be  
described as demonic. After coming to power, and for its duration, I believe it defies  
analysis by any presently understood social theory or set of merely social  
observations - and in particular by any known theory invoking interests, be they class  
or state interests, or other than purely psychological 'interests' of any entity that can  
be defined in the present state of human knowledge. But this I do not mean that such  
forces are unknowable in principle; on the contrary, one must hope that with the  
growth of human knowledge they will come to be understood. But at present they are  
neither understood nor capable of being rationally predicted - and this applies to all  
[[racism]] in all societies. (25) As a matter of fact, no political figure or group of any  
political color in any country had predicted even vaguely the horrors of Nazism. Only  
artists and poets such as Heine were able to glimpse some of what the future had in  
store. We do not know how they did it; and besides, many of their other hunches were  
wrong.

The Zionist Response

Historically, zionism is both a reaction to antisemitism and a conservative  
[[alliance]] with it - although the Zionists, like other [[Europe]]an conservatives, did not  
fully realize with whom they were allying themselves.

Until the rise of modern antisemitism, the mood of [[Europe]]an Jewry was  
optimistic, indeed excessively so. This was manifested not only in the very large  
number of Jews, particularly in western countries, who simply opted out of classical  
Judaism, apparently without any great regret, in the first or

\[70\] second generation after this became possible, but also in the formation of a  
strong cultural movement, the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah), which began in  
Germany and [[Austria]] around [[1780]], was then carried into eastern [[Europe]] and by  
[[1850]]-70 was making itself felt as a considerable social force. I cannot enter here into

a discussion of the movement's cultural achievements, such as the revival of Hebrew  
literature and the creation of a wonderful literature in Yiddish. However, it is  
important to note that despite many internal differences, the movement as a whole  
was characterized by two common beliefs: a belief in the need for a funda[[mental]]  
critique of Jewish society and particularly of the social role of the Jewish religion in  
its classical form, and the almost messianic hope for the victory of the 'forces of good'  
in [[Europe]]an societies. The latter forces were naturally defined by the sole criterion of  
their support for Jewish emancipation.

The growth of antisemitism as a popular movement, and the many [[alliance]]s of  
the conservative forces with it, dealt a severe blow to the Jewish Enlightenment. The  
blow was especially devastating because in actual fact the rise of antisemitism  
occurred just after the Jews were emancipated in some [[Europe]]an countries, and even  
before they were freed in others. The Jews of the [[Austria]]n [[empire]] received fully equal  
rights only in [[1867]]. In Germany, some independent states emancipated their Jews  
quite early, but others did not; notably, Prussia was grudging and tardy in this  
matter, and final emancipation of the Jews in the German [[empire]] as a whole was only  
granted by Bismarck in [[1871]]. In the Ottoman [[empire]] the Jews were subject to official  
discrimination until [[1909]], and in [[Russia]] (as well as [[[[Roma]]nia]]) until [[1917]]. Thus  
modern antisemitism began within a decade of the emancipation of the Jews in  
central [[Europe]] and long before the emancipation of the biggest Jewish community at  
that time, that of the Tsarist [[empire]].

It is therefore easy for the Zionists to ignore half of the relevant facts, revert to  
the segregationist stance of classical Judaism, and claim that since all Gentiles always  
hate and persecute all Jews, the only solution would be to remove all the Jews bodily  
and concentrate them in Palestine or Uganda or wherever. (26) Some early Jewish  
critics of zionism were quick to point out that if one assumes a permanent and  
ahistorical incompatibility between Jews and Gentiles an assumption shared by both  
zionists and antisemites! - then to concentrate the Jews in one place would simply  
bring upon them the hatred of the Gentiles in that part of the world (as indeed was to  
happen, though for very different reasons). But as far as I know this logical argument  
did not make any

\[71\] impression, just as all the logical and factual arguments against the myth of the  
'Jewish race' made not the slightest difference to the antisemites.

In fact, close relations have always existed between Zionists and antisemites:  
exactly like some of the [[Europe]]an conservatives, the Zionists thought they could  
ignore the 'demonic' character of antisemitism and use the antisemites for their own  
purposes. Many examples of such [[alliance]]s are well known. Herzl allied himself with  
the notorious Count von Plehve, the antisemitic minister of Tsar Nicholas II; (27)  
Jabotinsky made a pact with Petlyura, the reactionary Ukrainian leader whose forces  
massacred some 100,000 Jews in [[1918]]-21; Ben-Gurion's allies among the [[French]]  
extreme right during the [[Algeria]]n war included some notorious antisemites who  
were, however, careful to explain that they were only against the Jews in [[France]], not  
in [[Israel]].

Perhaps the most shocking example of this type is the delight with which some  
Zionist leaders in Germany welcomed Hitler's rise to power, because they shared his

belief in the primacy of 'race' and his hostility to the assimilation of Jews among  
'Aryans'. They congratulated Hitler on his triumph over the common enemy - the  
forces of liberalism. Dr Joachim Prinz, a Zionist rabbi who subsequently emigrated to  
the [[USA]], where he rose to be vice-chairman of the World Jewish [[Congress]] and a  
leading light in the World Zionist Organization (as well as a great friend of Golda  
Meir), published in [[1934]] a special book, Wir Juden (We, Jews), to celebrate Hitler's  
so- called German Revolution and the defeat of liberalism:

    The meaning of the German Revolution for the German nation will eventually
    be clear to those who have created it and formed its image. Its meaning for us must
    be set forth here: the fortunes of liberalism are lost. The only form of political life
    which has helped Jewish assimilation is sunk. (28)
    

The victory of Nazism rules out assimilation and mixed marriages as an option  
for Jews. 'We are not unhappy about this,' said Dr Prinz. In the fact that Jews are  
being forced to identify themselves as Jews, he sees 'the fulfillment of our desires'.  
And further:

    We want assimilation to be replaced by a new law: the declaration of
    belonging to the Jewish nation and Jewish race. A state built upon the
    principle of the purity of nation and race can only honored and respected by a Jew
    who declares his belonging to his own kind. Having so declared himself, he will
    never be capable of faulty loyalty towards a state. The state cannot want other Jews
    but such as declare themselves as belonging to their nation. It will not want Jewish
    flatterers and
    

###### \[72\]

    crawlers. It must demand of us faith and loyalty to our own interest. For only he
    who honors his own breed and his own blood can have an attitude of honor towards
    the national will of other nations. (29)
    

The whole book is full of similar crude flatteries of Nazi ideology, glee at the  
defeat of liberalism and particularly of the ideas of the [[French]] Revolution (30) a and  
great expectations that, in the congenial atmosphere of the myth of the Aryan race,  
Zionism and the myth of the Jewish race will also thrive.

Of course, Dr Prinz, like many other early sympathizers and allies of Nazism,  
did not realize where that movement (and modern antisemitism generally) was  
leading. Equally, many people at present do not realize where zionism - the  
movement in which Dr Prinz was an honored figure - is tending: to a combination of  
all the old hates of classical Judaism towards Gentiles and to the indiscriminate and  
ahistorical use of all the persecutions of Jews throughout [[history]] in order to justify  
the zionist persecution of the Palestinians.

For, insane as it sounds, it is nevertheless plain upon close examination of the  
real motives of the zionists, that one of the most deep-seated ideological sources of  
the Zionist establishment's persistent hostility towards the Palestinians is the fact  
that they are identified in the minds of many east-[[Europe]]an Jews with the rebellious  
east-[[Europe]]an peasants who participated in the Chmielnicki uprising and in similar  
revolts - and the latter are in turn identified ahistorically with modern antisemitism

and Nazism.

Confronting the Past

All Jews who really want to extricate themselves from the tyranny of the  
totalitarian Jewish past must face the question of their attitude towards the popular  
anti-Jewish manifestations of the past, particularly those connected with the  
[[rebellion]]s of enserfed peasants. On the other side, all the apologists of the Jewish  
religion and of Jewish segregationism and chauvinism also take their stand - both  
ultimately and in current debates - on the same question. The undoubted fact that the  
peasant [[revolution]]aries committed shocking atrocities against Jews (as well as  
against their other oppressors) is used as an 'argument' by those apologists, in exactly  
the same way that the Palestinian terror is used to justify the denial of justice to the  
Palestinians.

Our own answer must be a universal one, applicable in principle to all  
comparable cases. And, for a Jew who truly seeks [[liberation]] from Jewish  
particularism and [[racism]] and from

\[73\] the dead hand of the Jewish religion, such an answer is not very difficult.

After all, revolts of oppressed peasants against their masters and their masters'  
bailiffs are common in human [[history]]. A generation after the Chmielnicki uprising of  
the Ukrainian peasants, the [[Russia]]n peasants rose under the leadership of Stenka  
Ryazin, and again. one hundred years later, in the Pugachev [[rebellion]]. In Germany  
there was the Peasant [[War]] of [[1525]], in [[France]] the Jacquerie of 1357-8 and many other  
popular revolts, not to mention the many slave uprisings in all parts of the world. All  
of them - and I have intentionally chosen to mention examples in which Jews were  
not targets - were attended by horrifying massacres, just as the [[Great]] [[French]]  
Revolution was accompanied by appalling acts of terror. What is the position of true  
progressives - and, by now, of most ordinary decent educated people be they [[Russia]]n,  
German or [[French]] - on these [[rebellion]]s? Do decent English historians, even when  
noting the massacres of Englishmen by rebellious [[Irish]] peasants rising against their  
enslavement, condemn the latter as 'anti-English racists'? What is the attitude of  
progressive [[French]] historians towards the great slave [[revolution]] in Santo Domingo,  
where many [[French]] women and [[child]]ren were butchered? To ask the question is to  
answer it. But to ask a similar question of many 'progressive' or even socialist' Jewish  
circles is to receive a very different answer; here an enslaved peasant is transformed  
into a racist monster, if Jews profited from his state of [[slavery]] and exploitation.

The maxim that those who do not learn from [[history]] are condemned to repeat it  
applies to those Jews who refuse to come to terms with the Jewish past: they have  
become its [[slaves]] and are repeating it in Zionist and [[Israel]]i policies. The State of  
[[Israel]] now fulfills towards the oppressed peasants of many countries - not only in the  
Middle East but also far beyond it - a role not unlike that of the Jews in pre-[[1795]]  
[[Poland]]: that of a bailiff to the imperial oppressor. It is characteristic and instructive  
that [[Israel]]'s major role in arming the forces of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua, and  
those of Guatemala, El Salvador, Chile and the rest has not given rise to any wide  
public debate in [[Israel]] or among organized Jewish communities in the diaspora. Even  
the narrower question of expediency - whether the selling of weapons to a dictatorial

butcher of freedom fighters and peasants is in the long term interest of Jews - is  
seldom asked. Even more significant is the large part taken in this business by  
religious Jews, and the total silence of their rabbis (who are very vocal in inciting  
hatred against Arabs). It seems that [[Israel]] and Zionism are a throw-back to

\[74\] the role of classical Judaism - writ large, on a global scale, and under more  
dangerous circumstances.

The only possible answer to all this, first of all by Jews, must be that given by all  
true advocates of freedom and humanity in all countries, all peoples and all great  
philosophies- limited though they sometimes are, as the human condition itself is  
limited. We must confront the Jewish past and those aspects of the present which are  
based simultaneously on lying about that past and worshiping it. The prerequisites  
for this are, first, total honesty about the facts and, secondly, the belief (leading to  
action, whenever possible) in universalist human principles of ethics and politics.

The ancient [[Chinese]] sage Mencius (4th century BC), much admired by Voltaire,  
once wrote:

    This is why I say that all men have a sense of commiseration: here is a man
    who suddenly notices a [[child]] about to falI into a well. Invariably he will feel a sense
    of alarm and compassion. And this is not for the purpose of gaining the favor of the
    [[child]]'s parents or of seeking the approbation of his neighbors and friends, or for fear
    of blame should he fail to rescue it. Thus we see that no man is without a sense of
    compassion or a sense of shame or a sense of courtesy or a sense of right and wrong.
    The sense of compassion is the beginning of humanity, the sense of shame is the
    beginning of righteousness, and sense of courtesy is the beginning of decorum, the
    sense of right and wrong is the beginning of wisdom. Every man has within himself
    these four beginnings, just as he has four limbs. Since everyone has these four
    beginnings within him, the man who considers himself incapable of exercising them
    is destroying himself.
    

We have seen above, and will show in greater detail in the next chapter how far  
removed from this are the precepts with which the Jewish religion in its classical and  
talmudic form is poisoning minds and hearts.

The road to a genuine [[revolution]] in Judaism - to making it humane, allowing  
Jews to understand their own past, thereby re-educating themselves out of its  
tyranny - lies through an unrelenting critique of the Jewish religion. Without fear or  
favor, we must speak out against what belongs to our own past as Voltaire did against  
his:

    Écrasez l'infâme!

    Chapter 5
    

    The Laws Against Non-Jews
    

As explained in Chapter 3, the Halakhah, that is the legal system of classical  
Judaism - as practiced by virtually all Jews from the 9th century to the end of the l8th  
and as maintained to this very day in the form of Orthodox Judaism - is based  
primarily on the Babylonian Talmud. However, because of the unwieldy complexity  
of the legal disputations recorded in the Talmud, more manageable codifications of  
talmudic law became necessary and were indeed compiled by successive generations  
of rabbinical scholars. Some of these have acquired great authority and are in general  
use. For this reasons we shall refer for the most part to such compilations (and their  
most reputable commentaries) rather than directly to the Talmud. It is however  
correct to assume that the compilation referred to reproduces faithfully the meaning  
of the talmudic text and the additions made by later scholars on the basis of that  
meaning.

The earliest code of talmudic law which is still of major importance is the  
Mishneh Torah written by Moses Maimonides in the late 12th century. The most  
authoritative code, widely used to date as a handbook, is the Shulhan 'Arukh  
composed by R. Yosef Karo in the late 16th century as a popular condensation of his  
own much more voluminous Beys Yosef which was intended for the advanced  
scholar. The Shulhan 'Arukh is much commented upon; in addition to classical  
commentaries dating from the 17th century, there is an important 20th century one,  
Mishnah Berurah. Finally, the Talmudic Encyclopedia - a modern compilation  
published in [[Israel]] from the [[1950]]s and edited by the country's greatest Orthodox  
rabbinical scholars - is a good compendium of the whole talmudic literature.

Murder and Genocide

According to the Jewish religion, the murder of a Jew is a capital offense and  
one of the three most heinous sins (the other two being idolatry and adultery). Jewish  
religious courts and secular authorities are commanded to punish, even beyond the  
limits of the ordinary administration of justice, anyone guilty of murdering a Jew. A  
Jew who indirectly causes the [[death]] of another Jew is, however, only guilty of what  
talmudic law calls a sin against the 'laws of Heaven', to be punished by God rather  
than by man.

###### \[76\]

When the victim is a Gentile, the position is quite different. A Jew who murders  
a Gentile is guilty only of a sin against the laws of Heaven, not punishable by a court.  
(1) To cause indirectly the [[death]] of a Gentile is no sin at all. (2)

Thus, one of the two most important commentators on the Shulhan Arukh  
explains that when it comes to a Gentile, 'one must not lift one's hand to harm him,  
but one may harm him indirectly, for instance by removing a ladder after he had  
fallen into a crevice ... there is no prohibition here, because it was not done directly’  
(3) He points out, however, that an act leading indirectly to a Gentile's [[death]] is  
forbidden if it may cause the spread of hostility towards Jews. (4)

A Gentile murderer who happens to be under Jewish jurisdiction must be  
executed whether the victim was Jewish or not. However, if the victim was Gentile  
and the murderer converts to Judaism, he is not punished. (5)

All this has a direct and practical relevance to the realities of the State of [[Israel]].  
Although the state's criminal laws make no distinction between Jew and Gentile, such  
distinction is certainly made by Orthodox rabbis, who in guiding their flock follow the  
Halakhah. Of special importance is the advice they give to religious soldiers.

Since even the minimal interdiction against murdering a Gentile outright  
applies only to 'Gentiles with whom we \[the Jews\] are not at war', various rabbinical  
commentators in the past drew the logical conclusion that in wartime all Gentiles  
belonging to a hostile population may, or even should be [[kill]]ed. (6) Since [[1973]] this  
doctrine is being publicly propagated for the guidance of religious [[Israel]]i soldiers.  
The first such official exhortation was included in a booklet published by the Central  
Region Command of the [[Israel]]i Army, whose area includes the West Bank. In this  
booklet the Command's Chief Chaplain writes:

    When our forces come across civilians during a war or in hot pursuit or in a
    raid, so long as there is no certainty that those civilians are incapable of harming our
    forces, then according to the Halakhah they may and even should be [[kill]]ed... Under
    no circumstances should an Arab be trusted, even if he makes an impression of
    being civilized ... In war, when our forces storm the enemy, they are allowed and
    even enjoined by the Halakhah to [[kill]] even good civilians, that is, civilians who are
    ostensibly good. (7)
    

The same doctrine is expounded in the following exchange of letters between a  
young [[Israel]]i soldier and his rabbi, published in the yearbook of one of the country's  
most prestigious religious

\[77\] [[college]]s, Midrashiyyat No'am, where many leaders and activists of the National  
Religious Party and Gush Emunim have been educated. (8)

    Letter from the soldier Moshe to Rabbi Shim 'on Weiser '
    

    With God's help, to His Honor, my dear Rabbi,
    'First I would like to ask how you and your family are. I hope all is well. I
    am, thank God, feeling well. A long time I have not written. Please forgive me.
    

    Sometimes I recall the verse "when shall I come and appear before God?' (9) I
    hope, without being certain, that I shall come during one of the leaves. I must
    do so.
    'In one of the discussions in our group, there was a debate about the
    "purity of weapons" and we discussed whether it is permitted to [[kill]] unarmed
    men - or women and [[child]]ren? Or perhaps we should take revenge on the
    Arabs? And then everyone answered according to his own understanding. I
    could not arrive at a clear decision, whether Arabs should be treated like the
    AmeIekites, meaning that one is permitted to murder [sic] them until their
    remembrance is blotted out from under heaven, (10) or perhaps one should do
    as in a just war, in which one [[kill]]s only the soldiers?
    'A second problem I have is whether I am permitted to put myself in
    danger by allowing a woman to stay alive? For there have been cases when
    women threw hand grenades. Or am I permitted to give water to an Arab who
    put his hand up? For there may be reason to fear that he only means to deceive
    me and will [[kill]] me, and such things have happened.
    'I conclude with a warm greeting to the rabbi and all his family. - Moshe.'
    

    Reply of. Shun 'on Weiser to Moshe
    

'With the help of Heaven. Dear Moshe, Greetings.  
'I am starting this letter this evening although I know I cannot finish it  
this evening, both because I am busy and because I would like to make it a  
long letter, to answer your questions in full, for which purpose I shall have to  
copy out some of the sayings of our sages, of blessed memory, and interpret  
them. (11)  
'The non-Jewish nations have a custom according to which war has its  
own rules, like those of a game, like the rules of football or basketball. But  
according to the sayings of our sages, of blessed memory, \[...\] war for us is  
not a game but a vital necessity, and only by this standard must we decide  
how to wage  
\[78\]  
it. On the one hand \[...\] we seem to learn that if a Jew murders a Gentile, he  
is regarded as a murderer and, except for the fact that no court has the right  
to punish him, the gravity of the deed is like that of any other murder. But we  
find in the very same authorities in another place \[...\] that Rabbi Shim'on  
used to say: "The best of Gentiles - [[kill]] him; the best of snakes dash out its  
brains."  
'It might perhaps be argued that the expression "[[kill]]" in the saying of R.  
Shim'on is only figurative and should not be taken literally but as meaning  
"oppress" or some similar attitude, and in this way we also avoid a  
contradiction with the authorities quoted earlier. Or one might argue that  
this saying, though meant literally, is \[merely\] his own personal opinion,  
disputed by other sages \[quoted earlier\]. But we find the true explanation in  
the Tosalot. (12) There \[...\] we learn the following comment on the talmudic  
pronouncement that Gentiles who fall into a well should not be helped out,  
but neither should they be pushed into the well to be [[kill]]ed, which means that  
they should neither be saved from [[death]] nor [[kill]]ed directly. And the Tosafot  
write as follows:  
"And if it is queried \[because\] in another place it was said The best of  
Gentiles - [[kill]] him, then the answer is that this \[saying\] is meant for

wartime." \[...\]  
'According to the commentators of the Tosafot, a distinction must be  
made between wartime and peace, so that although during peace time it is  
forbidden to [[kill]] Gentiles, in a case that occurs in wartime it is a mitzvah  
\[imperative, religious duty\] to [[kill]] them.\[...\]  
'And this is the difference between a Jew and a Gentile: although the  
rule "Whoever comes to [[kill]] you, [[kill]] him first" applies to a Jew, as was said in  
Tractate Sanhedrin \[of the Talmud\], page 72a, still it only applies to him if  
there is \[actual\] ground to fear that he is coming to [[kill]] you. But a Gentile  
during wartime is usually to be presumed so, except when it is quite clear that  
he has no evil intent. This is the rule of "purity of weapons" according to the  
Halakhah - and not the alien conception which is now accepted in the [[Israel]]i  
army and which has been the cause of many \[Jewish\] casualties. I enclose a  
newspaper cutting with the speech made last week in the Knesset by Rabbi  
Kalman Kahana, which shows in a very lifelike - and also painful - way how  
this "purity of weapons" has caused [[death]]s.  
'I conclude here, hoping that you will not find the length of this letter  
irksome. This subject was being discussed even without your letter, but your  
letter caused me to write up the whole matter.  
\[79\]  
'Be in peace, you and all Jews, and \[I hope to\] see you soon, as you say.  
Yours - Shim'on.

    Reply of Moshe to R. Shim'on Weiser
    

    'To His Honor, my dear Rabbi,
    'First I hope that you and your family are in [[health]] and are all right.
    'I have received your long letter and am grateful for your personal watch
    over me, for I assume that you write to many, and most of your time is taken
    up with your studies in your own program.
    'Therefore my thanks to you are doubly deep.
    'As for the letter itself, I have understood it as follows:
    'In wartime I am not merely permitted, but enjoined to [[kill]] every Arab
    man and woman whom I chance upon, if there is reason to fear that they help
    in the war against us, directly or indirectly. And as far as I am concerned I
    have to [[kill]] them even if that might result in an involvement with the military
    law. I think that this matter of the purity of weapons should be transmitted to
    educational institutions, at least the religious ones, so that they should have a
    position about this subject and so that they will not wander in the broad
    fields of "logic", especially on this subject; and the rule has to be explained as
    it should be followed in practice. For, I am sorry to say, I have seen different
    types of "logic" here even among the religious comrades. I do hope that you
    shall be active in this, so that our boys will know the line of their ancestors
    clearly and unambiguously.
    'I conclude here, hoping that when the [training] course ends, in about a
    month, I shall be able to come to the yeshivah [talmudic [[college]]]. Greetings -
    Moshe.'
    

    Of course, this doctrine of the Halakhah on murder clashes, in principle, not
    only with [[Israel]]'s criminal law but also - as hinted in the letters just quoted - with
    official military standing regulations. However, there can be little doubt that in
    

practice this doctrine does exert an in[[flu]]ence on the administration of justice,  
especially by military authorities. The fact is that in all cases where Jews have, in a  
military or paramilitary context, [[murdered]] Arab non-combatants - including cases of  
mass murder such as that in Kafr Qasim in [[1956]] - the murderers, if not let off  
altogether, received extremely light sentences or won far-reaching remissions,  
reducing their punishment to next to nothing. (13)

Saving of Life

This subject - the supreme value of human life and the obligation of every  
human being to do the outmost to save the life of a fellow human - is of obvious  
importance in itself. It is also of particular interest in a Jewish context, in view of the  
fact that since the second world war Jewish opinion has - in some cases justly, in  
others unjustly - condemned 'the whole world' or at least all [[Europe]] for standing by  
when Jews were being massacred. Let us therefore examine what the Halakhah has  
to say on this subject.

According to the Halakhah, the duty to save the life of a fellow Jew is  
paramount. (14) It supersedes all other religious obligations and interdictions,  
excepting only the prohibitions against the three most heinous sins of adultery  
(including incest), murder and idolatry.

As for Gentiles, the basic talmudic principle is that their lives must not be saved,  
although it is also forbidden to murder them outright. The Talmud itself (15)  
expresses this in the maxim 'Gentiles are neither to be lifted \[out of a well\] nor hauled  
down \[into it\]'. Maimonides (16) explains:

    "As for Gentiles with whom we are not at war ... their [[death]] must not be
    caused, but it is forbidden to save them if they are at the point of [[death]]; if, for
    example, one of them is seen falling into the sea, he should not be rescued,
    for it is written: 'neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy fellow' (17) -
    but [a Gentile] is not thy fellow."
    

In particular, a Jewish doctor must not treat a Gentile patient. Maimonides -  
himself an illustrious physician - is quite explicit on this; in another passage (18) he  
repeats the distinction between 'thy fellow' and a Gentile, and concludes: 'and from  
this learn ye, that it is forbidden to heal a Gentile even for payment...'

However, the refusal of a Jew - particularly a Jewish doctor - to save the life of a  
Gentile may, if it becomes known, antagonize powerful Gentiles and so put Jews in  
danger. Where such danger exists, the obligation to avert it supersedes the ban on  
helping the Gentile. Thus Maimonides continues: ' ... but if you fear him or his  
hostility, cure him for payment, though you are forbidden to do so without payment.'  
In fact, Maimonides himself was Saladin's personal physician. His insistence on  
demanding payment - presumably in order to make sure that the act is not one of  
human charity but an unavoidable duty - is however not absolute. For in another  
passage he allows Gentile whose hostility is feared to be treated 'even gratis, if it is  
unavoidable'.

###### \[81\]

The whole doctrine - the ban on saving a Gentile's life or healing him, and the  
suspension of this ban in cases where there is fear of hostility - is repeated (virtually  
verbatim) by other major authorities, including the 14th century Arba'ah Turim and  
Karo's Beyt Yosef and Shulhan 'Arukh. (19) Beyt Yosef adds, quoting Maimonides:  
'And it is permissible to try out a drug on a heathen, if this serves a purpose'; and this  
is repeated also by the famous R. Moses Isserles.

The consensus of halakhic authorities is that the term 'Gentiles' in the above  
doctrine refers to all non-Jews. A lone voice of dissent is that of R. Moses Rivkes,  
author of a minor commentary on the Shulhan Arukh, who writes. (20)

    Our sages only said this about heathens, who in their day worshipped idols
    and did not believe in the Jewish Exodus from [[Egypt]] or in the creation of the world
    ex nihilo. But the Gentiles in whose [protective] shade we, the people of [[Israel]], are
    exiled and among whom we are scattered do believe in the creation of the world ex
    nihilo and in the Exodus and in several principles of our own religion and they pray
    to the Creator of heaven and earth ... Not only is there no interdiction against
    helping them, but we are even obliged to pray for their safety.
    

This passage, dating from the second half of the 17th century, is a favorite quote  
of apologetic scholars. (21) Actually, it does not go nearly as far as the apologetics  
pretend, for it advocates removing the ban on saving a Gentile's life, rather than  
making it mandatory as in the case of a Jew; and even this liberality extends only to  
Christians and Muslims but not the majority of human beings. Rather, what it does  
show is that there was a way in which the harsh doctrine of the Halakhah could  
have been progressively liberalized. But as a matter of fact the majority of later  
halakhic authorities, far from extending Rivkes' leniency to other human groups,  
have rejected it altogether.

Desecrating the Sabbath to Save Life

Desecrating the Shabbath - that is, doing work that would otherwise be banned  
on Saturday - becomes a duty when the need to save a Jew's life demands it.

The problem of saving a Gentile's life on the sabbath is not raised in the Talmud  
as a main issue, since it is in any case forbidden even on a weekday; it does however  
enter as a complicating factor in two connections.

First, there is a problem where a group of people are in danger, and it is possible  
(but not certain) that there is at least one Jew among them: should the sabbath be  
desecrated in

\[82\] order to save them? There is an extensive discussion of such cases. Following  
earlier authorities, including Maimonides and the Talmud itself, the Shulhan ‘Arukh  
(22) decides these matters according to the weight of probabilities. For example,  
suppose nine Gentiles and one Jew live in the same building. One Saturday the  
building collapses; one of the ten - it is not known which one - is away, but the other  
nine are trapped under the rubble. Should the rubble be cleared, thus desecrating the

sabbath, seeing that the Jew may not be under it (he may have been the one that got  
away)? The Shulhan 'Arukh says that it should, presumably because the odds that the  
Jew is under the rubble are high (nine to one). But now suppose that nine have got  
away and only one - again, it is not known which one - is trapped. Then there is no  
duty to clear the rubble, presumably because this time there are long odds (nine to  
one) against the Jew being the person trapped. Similarly: 'If a boat containing some  
Jews is seen to be in peril upon the sea, it is a duty incumbent upon all to desecrate  
the sabbath in order to save it.' However, the great R. 'Aqiva Eiger (died [[1837]])  
comments that this applies only 'when it is known that there are Jews on board. But  
... if nothing at all is known about the identity of those on board, \[the sabbath\] must  
not be desecrated, for one acts according to \[the weight of probabilities, and\] the  
majority of people in the world are Gentiles.’ (23) Thus, since there are very long odds  
against any of the passengers being Jewish, they must be allowed to drown.

Secondly, the provision that a Gentile may be saved or cared for in order to  
avert the danger of hostility is curtailed on the sabbath. A Jew called upon to help a  
Gentile on a weekday may have to comply because to admit that he is not allowed, in  
principle, to save the life of a non-Jew would be to invite hostility. But on Saturday  
the Jew can use sabbath observance as a plausible excuse. A paradigmatic case  
discussed at length in the Talmud (24) is that of a Jewish midwife invited to help a  
Gentile woman in [[child]]birth. The upshot is that the midwife is allowed to help on a  
weekday 'for fear of hostility', but on the sabbath she must not do so, because she can  
excuse herself by saying: 'We are allowed to desecrate the sabbath only for our own,  
who observe the sabbath, but for your people, who do not keep the sabbath, we are  
not allowed to desecrate it.' Is this explanation a genuine one or merely an excuse?  
Maimonides clearly thinks that it is just an excuse, which can be used even if the task  
that the midwife is invited to do does not actually involve any desecration of the  
sabbath. Presumably, the excuse will work just as well even in this case, because  
Gentiles are generally in the dark as to precisely which

\[83\] kinds of work are banned for Jews on the sabbath. At any rate, he decrees: 'A  
Gentile woman must not be helped in [[child]]birth on the sabbath, even for payment;  
nor must one fear hostility, even when \[such help involves\] no desecration of the  
sabbath.' The Shulhan 'Arukh decrees likewise. (25)

Nevertheless, this sort of excuse could not always be relied upon to do the trick  
and avert Gentile hostility. Therefore certain important rabbinical authorities had to  
relax the rules to some extent and allowed Jewish doctors to treat Gentiles on the  
sabbath even if this involved doing certain types of work normally banned on that  
day. This partial relaxation applied particularly to rich and powerful Gentile patients,  
who could not be fobbed off so easily and whose hostility could be dangerous.

Thus, R. Yo'el Sirkis, author of [[Bay]]it Hadash and one of the greatest rabbis of  
his time ([[Poland]], 17th century), decided that 'mayors, petty nobles and aristocrats'  
should be treated on the sabbath, because of the fear of their hostility which involves  
'some danger'. But in other cases, especially when the Gentile can be fobbed off with  
an evasive excuse, a Jewish doctor would commit 'an unbearable sin' by treating him  
on the sabbath. Later in the same century, a similar verdict was given in the [[French]]  
city of Metz, whose two parts were connected by a pontoon bridge. Jews are not  
normally allowed to cross such a bridge on the sabbath, but the rabbi of Metz decided

that a Jewish doctor may nevertheless do so 'if he is called to the great governor':  
since the doctor is known to cross the bridge for the sake of his Jewish patients, the  
governor's hostility could be aroused if the doctor refused to do so for his sake. Under  
the authoritarian rule of Louis XIV, it was evidently important to have the goodwill of  
his intendant; the feelings of lesser Gentiles were of little importance. (26)

Hokhmat Shlomoh, a 19th century commentary on the Shulhan 'Arukh,  
mentions a similarly strict interpretation of the concept 'hostility' in connection with  
the Karaites, a small heretical Jewish sect. According to this view, their lives must not  
be saved if that would involve desecration of the sabbath, 'for "hostility" applies only  
to the heathen, who are many against us, and we are delivered into their hands .. But  
the Karaites are few and we are not delivered into their hands, \[so\] the fear of  
hostility does not apply to them at all.' (27) In fact, the absolute ban on desecrating  
the sabbath in order to save the life of a Karaite is still in force today, as we shall see.

The whole subject is extensively discussed in the responsa of R. Moshe Sofer -  
better known as 'Hatam Sofer' – the

\[84\] famous rabbi of Pressburg (Bratislava) who died in [[1832]]. His conclusions are of  
more than historical interest, since in [[1966]] one of his responsa was publicly endorsed  
by the then Chief Rabbi of [[Israel]] as 'a basic institution of the Halakhah'. (28) The  
particular question asked of Hatam Sofer concerned the situation in [[Turkey]], where it  
was decreed during one of the wars that in each township or village there should be  
midwives on call, ready to hire themselves out to any woman in labor. Some of these  
midwives were Jewish; should they hire themselves out to help Gentile women on  
weekdays and on the sabbath?

In his responsum, (29) Hatam Sofer first concludes, after careful investigation,  
that the Gentiles concerned - that is, Ottoman Christians and Muslims - are not only  
idolators 'who definitely worship other gods and thus should "neither be lifted \[out of  
a well\] nor hauled down",' but are likened by him to the Amalekites, so that the  
talmudic ruling 'it is forbidden to multiply the seed of Amalek' applies to them. In  
principle, therefore, they should not be helped even on weekdays. However, in  
practice it is 'permitted' to heal Gentiles and help them in labor, if they have doctors  
and midwives of their own, who could be called instead of the Jewish ones. For if  
Jewish doctors and midwives refused to attend to Gentiles, the only result would be  
loss of income to the former - which is of course undesirable. This applies equally on  
weekdays and on the sabbath, provided no desecration of the sabbath is involved.  
However, in the latter case the sabbath can serve as an excuse to 'mislead the heathen  
woman and say that it would involve desecration of the sabbath'.

In connection with cases that do actually involve desecration of the sabbath,  
Hatam Sofer - like other authorities - makes a distinction between two categories of  
work banned on the sabbath. First, there is work banned by the Torah, the biblical  
text (as interpreted by the Talmud); such work may only be performed in very  
exceptional cases, if failing to do so would cause an extreme danger of hostility  
towards Jews. Then there are types of work which are only banned by the sages who  
extended the original law of the Torah; the attitude towards breaking such bans is  
generally more lenient.

Another responsum of Hatam Sofer (30) deals with the question whether it is  
permissible for a Jewish doctor to travel by carriage on the sabbath in order to heal a  
Gentile. After pointing out that under certain conditions traveling by horsedrawn  
carriage on the sabbath only violates a ban imposed 'by the sages' rather than by the  
Torah, he goes on to recall

\[85\] Maimonides' pronouncement that Gentile women in labor must not be helped  
on the sabbath, even if no desecration of the sabbath is involved, and states that the  
same principle applies to all medical practice, not just midwifery. But he then voices  
the fear that if this were put into practice, 'it would arouse undesirable hostility,' for  
'the Gentiles would not accept the excuse of sabbath observance,' and 'would say that  
the blood of an idolator has little worth in our eyes'. Also, perhaps more importantly,  
Gentile doctors might take revenge on their Jewish patients. Better excuses must be  
found. He advises a Jewish doctor who is called to treat a Gentile patient out of town  
on the sabbath to excuse himself by saying that he is required to stay in town in order  
to look after his other patients, 'for he can use this in order to say, "I cannot move  
because of the danger to this or that patient, who needs a doctor first, and I may not  
desert my charge" ... With such an excuse there is no fear of danger, for it is a  
reasonable pretext, commonly given by doctors who are late in arriving because  
another patient needed them first.' Only 'if it is impossible to give any excuse' is the  
doctor permitted to travel by carriage on the sabbath in order to treat a Gentile.

In the whole discussion, the main issue is the excuses that should be made, not  
the actual healing or the [[welfare]] of the patient. And throughout it is taken for granted  
that it is all right to deceive Gentiles rather than treat them, so long as 'hostility' can  
be averted. (31)

Of course, in modern times most Jewish doctors are not religious and do not  
even know of these rules. Moreover, it appears that even many who are religious  
prefer to their credit - to abide by the Hippocratic oath rather than by the precepts of  
their fanatic rabbis. (32) However, the rabbis' guidance cannot fail to have some  
in[[flu]]ence on some doctors; and there are certainly many who, while not actually  
following that guidance, choose not to [[protest]] against it publicly.

All this is far from being a dead issue. The most up- to-date halakhic position on  
these matters is contained in a recent concise and authoritative book published in  
English under the title Jewish Medical Law. (33) This book, which bears the imprint  
of the prestigious [[Israel]]i foundation Mossad Harav Kook, is based on the responsa of  
R. Eli'ezer Yehuda Waldenberg, Chief Justice of the Rabbinical District Court of  
Jerusalem. A few passages of this work deserve special mention.

First, 'it is forbidden to desecrate the sabbath ... for a Karaite.' (34) This is stated  
bluntly, absolutely and without any further qualification. Presumably the hostility of  
this small sect makes no difference, so they should be allowed to die rather

\[86\] than be treated on the sabbath.

As for Gentiles: 'According to the ruling stated in the Talmud and Codes of  
Jewish Law, it is forbidden to desecrate the Sabbath - whether violating Biblical or  
rabbinic law - in order to save the life of a dangerously ill gentile patient. It is also

forbidden to deliver the baby of a gentile women on the Sabbath.' (35)

But this is qualified by a dispensation: 'However, today it is permitted to  
desecrate the Sabbath on behalf of a Gentile by performing actions prohibited by  
rabbinic law, for by so doing one prevents ill feelings from arising between Jew and  
Gentile.' (36)

This does not go very far, because medical [[treatment]] very often involves acts  
banned on the sabbath by the Torah itself, which are not covered by this  
dispensation. There are, we are told, 'some' halakhic authorities who extend the  
dispensation to such acts as well - but this is just another way of saying that most  
halakhic authorities, and the ones that really count, take the opposite view. However,  
all is not lost. Jewish Medical Law has a truly breathtaking solution to this difficulty.

The solution hangs upon a nice point of talmudic law. A ban imposed by the  
Torah on performing a given act on the sabbath is presumed to apply only when the  
primary intention in performing it is the actual outcome of the act. (For example,  
grinding wheat is presumed to be banned by the Torah only if the purpose is actually  
to obtain flour.) On the other hand, if the performance of the same act is merely  
incidental to some other purpose (melakhah seh'eynah tzrikhah legufah) then the act  
changes its status - it is still forbidden, to be sure, but only by the sages rather than by  
the Torah itself. Therefore:

    In order to avoid any transgression of the law, there is a legally acceptable
    method of rendering [[treatment]] on behalf of a gentile patient even when dealing with
    violation of Biblical Law. It is suggested that at the time that the physician is
    providing the necessary care, his intentions should not primarily be to cure the
    patient, but to protect himself and the Jewish people from accusations of religious
    discrimination and severe retaliation that may endanger him in particular and the
    Jewish people in general. With this intention, any act on the physician's part
    becomes an act whose actual outcome is not its primary purpose' ... which is
    forbidden on Sabbath only by rabbinic law. (37)
    

This hypocritical substitute for the Hippocratic oath is also proposed by a recent  
authoritative Hebrew book. (38)

    Although the facts were mentioned at least twice in the
    

\[87\] [[Israel]]i press, (39) the [[Israel]]i Medical Association has remained silent.

Having treated in some detail the supremely important subject of the attitude of  
the Halakhah to a Gentile's very life, we shall deal much more briefly with other  
halakhic rules which discriminate against Gentiles. Since the number of such rules is  
very large, we shall mention only the more important ones.

Sexual Offenses

    Sexual Intercourse between a married Jewish woman and any man other than
    

her husband is a capital offense for both parties, and one of the three most heinous  
sins. The status of Gentile women is very different. The Halakhah presumes all  
Gentiles to be utterly promiscuous and the verse 'whose flesh is as the flesh of asses,  
and whose issue \[of semen\] is like the issue of horses' (40) is applied to them.  
Whether a Gentile woman is married or not makes no difference, since as far as Jews  
are concerned the very concept of matrimony does not apply to Gentiles ('There is no  
matrimony for a heathen'). Therefore, the concept of adultery also does not apply to  
intercourse between a Jewish man and a Gentile woman; rather, the Talmud (41)  
equates such intercourse to the sin of bestiality. (For the same reason, Gentiles are  
generally presumed not to have certain paternity.)

According to the Talmudic Encyclopedia: (42) 'He who has carnal knowledge of  
the wife of a Gentile is not liable to the [[death]] penalty, for it is written: "thy fellow's  
wife" (43) rather than the alien's wife; and even the precept that a man "shall cleave  
unto his wife" (44) which is addressed to the Gentiles does not apply to a Jew, just  
there is no matrimony for a heathen; and although a married Gentile woman is  
forbidden to the Gentiles, in any case a Jew is exempted.'

This does not imply that sexual intercourse between a Jewish man and a Gentile  
woman is permitted - quite the contrary. But the main punishment is inflicted on the  
Gentile woman; she must be executed, even if she was raped by the Jew: 'If a Jew has  
coitus with a Gentile woman, whether she be a [[child]] of three or an adult, whether  
married or unmarried, and even if he is a minor aged only nine years and one day -  
because he had willful coitus with her, she must be [[kill]]ed, as is the case with a beast,  
because through her a Jew got into trouble' (45) The Jew, however, must be flogged,  
and if he is a Kohen (member of the priestly tribe) he must receive double the  
number of lashes, because he has committed a

\[88\] double offense: a Kohen must not have intercourse with a prostitute, and  
all Gentile women are presumed to be prostitutes. (46)

Status

According to the Halakhah, Jews must not (if they can help it) allow a Gentile to  
be appointed to any position of authority, however small, over Jews. (The two stock  
examples are commander over ten soldiers in the Jewish army' and 'superintendent  
of an irrigation ditch'.) Significantly, this particular rule applies also to converts to  
Judaism and to their descendants (through the female line) for ten generations or 'so  
long as the descent is known'.

Gentiles are presumed to be congenital liars, and are disqualified from testifying  
in a rabbinical court. In this respect their position is, in theory, the same as that of  
Jewish women, [[slaves]] and minors; but in practice it is actually worse. A Jewish  
woman is nowadays admitted as a witness to certain matters of fact, when the  
rabbinical court 'believes' her; a Gentile - never.

A problem therefore arises when a rabbinical court needs to establish a fact for  
which there are only Gentile witnesses. An important example of this is in cases  
concerning widows: by Jewish religious law, a woman can be declared a widow - and  
hence free to re-marry - only if the [[death]] of her husband is proven with certainty by

means of a witness who saw him die or identified his corpse. However, the rabbinical  
court will accept the hearsay evidence of a Jew who testifies to having heard the fact  
in question mentioned by a Gentile eyewitness, provided the court is satisfied that the  
latter was speaking casually (goy mesiah lefi tummo) rather than in reply to a direct  
question; for a Gentile's direct answer to a Jew's direct question is presumed to be a  
lie. (47) If necessary, a Jew (preferably a rabbi) will actually undertake to chat up the  
Gentile eyewitness and, without asking a direct question, extract from him a casual  
statement of the fact at issue.

Money and Property

(1) Gifts. The Talmud bluntly forbids giving a gift to a Gentile. However,  
classical rabbinical authorities bent this rule because it is customary among  
businessmen to give gifts to business contacts. It was therefore laid down that a Jew  
may give a gift to a Gentile acquaintance, since this is regarded not as a true gift but  
as a sort of investment, for which some return is expected. Gifts to 'unfamiliar  
Gentiles' remain forbidden. A broadly similar rule

\[89\] applies to almsgiving. Giving alms to a Jewish beggar is an important religious  
duty. Alms to Gentile beggars are merely permitted for the sake of peace. However  
there are numerous rabbinical warnings against allowing the Gentile poor to become  
'accustomed' to receiving alms from Jews, so that it should be possible to withhold  
such alms without arousing undue hostility.

(2) Taking of interest. Anti-Gentile discrimination in this matter has become  
largely theoretical, in view of the dispensation (explained in Chapter 3) which in  
effect allows interest to be exacted even from a Jewish borrower. However, it is still  
the case that granting an interest-free loan to a Jew is recommended as an act of  
charity, but from a Gentile borrower it is mandatory to exact interest. In fact, many -  
though not all - rabbinical authorities, including Maimonides, consider it mandatory  
to exact as much usury as possible on a loan to a Gentile.

(3) Lost [[property]]. If a Jew finds [[property]] whose probable owner is Jewish,  
the finder is strictly enjoined to make a positive effort to return his find by  
advertising it publicly. In contrast, the Talmud and all the early rabbinical authorities  
not only allow a Jewish finder to appropriate an article lost by a Gentile, but actually  
forbid him or her to return it. (48) In more recent times, when laws were passed in  
most countries making it mandatory to return lost articles, the rabbinical authorities  
instructed Jews to do what these laws say, as an act of civil obedience to the state -  
but not as a religious duty, that is without making a positive effort to discover the  
owner if it is not probable that he is Jewish.

(4) Deception in business. It is a grave sin to practice any kind of deception  
whatsoever against a Jew. Against a Gentile it is only forbidden to practice direct  
deception. Indirect deception is allowed, unless it is likely to cause hostility towards  
Jews or insult to the Jewish religion. The paradigmatic example is mistaken  
calculation of the price during purchase. If a Jew makes a mistake unfavorable to  
himself, it is one's religious duty to correct him. If a Gentile is spotted making such a  
mistake, one need not let him know about it, but say 'I rely on your calculation', so as  
to forestall his hostility in case he subsequently discovers his own mistake.

(5) Fraud. It is forbidden to defraud a Jew by selling or buying at an  
unreasonable price. However, 'Fraud does not apply to Gentiles, for it is written: "Do  
not defraud each man his brother"; (49) but a Gentile who defrauds a Jew should be  
compelled to make good the fraud, but should not be punished more severely than a  
Jew \[in a similar case\].' (50)

    (6) Theft and robbery. Stealing (without [[violence]]) is absolutely
    

\[90\] forbidden - as the Shulhan 'Arukh so nicely puts it: 'even from a Gentile'.  
Robbery (with [[violence]]) is strictly forbidden if the victim is Jewish. However, robbery  
of a Gentile by a Jew is not forbidden outright but only under certain circumstances  
such as 'when the Gentiles are not under our rule', but is permitted 'when they are  
under our rule'. Rabbinical authorities differ among themselves as to the precise  
details of the circumstances under which a Jew may rob a Gentile, but the whole  
debate is concerned only with the relative power of Jews and Gentiles rather than  
with universal considerations of justice and humanity. This may explain why so very  
few rabbis have [[protest]]ed against the robbery of Palestinian [[property]] in [[Israel]]: it was  
backed by overwhelming Jewish power.

Gentiles in the Land of lsrael

In addition to the general anti-Gentile laws, the Halakhah has special laws  
against Gentiles who live in the Land of [[Israel]] (Eretz Yisra'el) or, in some cases,  
merely pass through it. These laws are designed to promote Jewish supremacy in that  
country.

The exact geographical definition of the term 'Land of [[Israel]]' is much disputed  
in the Talmud and the talmudic literature, and the debate has continued in modern  
times between the various shades of zionist opinion. According to the maximalist  
view, the Land of [[Israel]] includes (in addition to Palestine itself) not only the whole of  
Sinai, Jordan, Syria and [[Lebanon]], but also considerable parts of [[Turkey]]. (51) The  
more prevalent 'minimalist' interpretation puts the northern border 'only' about half  
way through Syria and [[Lebanon]], at the latitude of Homs. This view was supported by  
Ben~Gurion. However, even those who thus exclude parts of Syria-[[Lebanon]] agree  
that certain special discriminatory laws (though less oppressive than in the Land of  
[[Israel]] proper) apply to the Gentiles of those parts, because that territory was included  
in David's kingdom. In all talmudic interpretations the Land of [[Israel]] includes  
Cyprus.

I shall now list a few of the special laws concerning Gentiles in the Land of  
[[Israel]]. Their connection with actual zionist practice will be quite apparent.

The Halakhah forbids Jews to sell immovable [[property]] - fields and houses - in  
the Land of [[Israel]] to Gentiles. In Syria, the sale of houses (but not of fields) is  
permitted.

Leasing a house in the Land of [[Israel]] to a Gentile is permitted under two  
conditions. First, that the house shall not be used for habitation but for other  
purposes, such as storage. Second, that three or more adjoining houses shall not be so

leased.

    These and several other rules are explained as follows: ... 'so
    

\[91\] that you shall not allow them to camp on the ground, for if they do not possess  
land, their sojourn there will be temporary.' (52) Even temporary Gentile presence  
may only be tolerated 'when the Jews are in exile, or when the Gentiles are more  
powerful than the Jews,' but

    when the Jews are more powerful than the Gentiles we are forbidden to let an
    idolator among us; even a temporary resident or itinerant [[trade]]r shall not be allowed
    to pass through our land unless he accepts the seven Noahide precepts, (53) for it is
    written: 'they shall not dwell in thy land' (54) that is, not even temporarily. If he
    accepts the seven Noahide precepts, he becomes a resident alien (ger toshav) but it
    is forbidden to grant the status of resident alien except at times when the Jubilee is
    held [that is, when the Temple stands and sacrifices are offered]. However, during
    times when Jubilees are not held it is forbidden to accept anyone who is not a full
    convert to Judaism (ger tzedeq). (55)
    

It is therefore clear that - exactly as the leaders and sympathizers of Gush  
Emunim say - the whole question to how the Palestinians ought to be treated is,  
according to the Halakhah, simply a question of Jewish power: if Jews have sufficient  
power, then it is their religious duty to expel the Palestinians.

All these laws are often quoted by [[Israel]]i rabbis and their zealous followers. For  
example, the law forbidding the lease of three adjoining houses to Gentiles was  
solemnly quoted by a rabbinical conference held in [[1979]] to discuss the Camp David  
[[treaties]]. The conference also declared that according to the Halakhah even the  
'autonomy' that Begin was ready to offer to the Palestinians is too liberal. Such  
pronouncements - which do in fact state correctly the position of the Halakhah - are  
rarely contested by the Zionist 'left'.

In addition to laws such as those mentioned so far, which are directed at all  
Gentiles in the Land of [[Israel]], an even greater evil in[[flu]]ence arises from special laws  
against the ancient Canaanites and other nations who lived in Palestine before its  
conquest by Joshua, as well as against the Amalekites. All those nations must be  
utterly exterminated, and the Talmud and talmudic literature reiterate the genocidal  
biblical exhortations with even greater vehemence. In[[flu]]ential rabbis, who have a  
considerable following among [[Israel]]i army officers, identify the Palestinians (or even  
all Arabs) with those ancient nations, so that commands like 'thou shalt save alive  
nothing that breatheth'56 acquire a topical meaning. In fact, it is not uncommon for  
reserve soldiers called up to do a tour of duty in the Gaza Strip to be given an  
'educational lecture' in which they are told that the Palestinians of Gaza are 'like the

\[92\] Amalekites'. Biblical verses exhorting to genocide of the Midianite57 were  
solemnly quoted by an important [[Israel]]i rabbi in justification of the Qibbiya  
massacre, (58) and this pronouncement has gained wide circulation in the [[Israel]]i  
army. There are many similar examples of bloodthirsty rabbinical pronouncements  
against the Palestinians, based on these laws.

Abuse

Under this heading I would like to discuss examples of halakhic laws whose  
most important effect is not so much to prescribe specific anti-Gentile discrimination  
as to inculcate an attitude of s[[corn]] and hatred towards Gentiles. Accordingly. in this  
section I shall not confine myself to quoting from the most authoritative halakhic  
sources (as I have done so far) but include also less funda[[mental]] works, which are  
however widely used in religious instruction.

Let us begin with the text of some common prayers. In one of the first sections  
of the daily morning payer, every devout Jew blesses God for not making him a  
Gentile. (59) The concluding section of the daily prayer (which is also used in the  
most solemn part of the service on [[New]] Year's day and on Yom Kippur) opens with  
the statement: 'We must praise the Lord of all ... for not making us like the nations of  
\[all\] lands ... for they bow down to vanity and nothingness and pray to a god that does  
not help.' (60) The last clause was censored out of the prayer books. but in eastern  
[[Europe]] it was supplied orally, and has now been restored into many [[Israel]]i-printed  
prayer books. In the most important section of the weekday prayer - the 'eighteen  
blessings' - there is a special curse, originally directed against Christians, Jewish  
converts to Christianity and other Jewish heretics: 'And may the apostates' (61) have  
no hope, and all the Christians perish instantly'. This formula dates from the end of  
the 1st century, when Christianity was still a small persecuted sect. Some time before  
the 14th century it was softened into: 'And may the apostates have no hope. and all  
the heretics (62) perish instantly', and after additional pressure into: 'And may the  
informers have no hope, and all the heretics perish instantly'. After the establishment  
of [[Israel]]. the process was reversed, and many newly printed prayer books reverted to  
the second formula, which was also prescribed by many teachers in religious [[Israel]]i  
schools. After [[1967]], several congregations close to Gush Emunim have restored the  
first version (so far only verbally, not in print) and now pray daily that the Christians  
may perish instantly'. This process of reversion happened in the period when the  
Catholic Church (under [[Pope]] John XXIII)

\[93\] removed from its Good Friday service a prayer which asked the Lord to have  
mercy on Jews, heretics etc. This prayer was thought by most Jewish leaders to be  
offensive and even antisemitic.

Apart from the fixed daily prayers, a devout Jew must utter special short  
blessings on various occasions, both good and bad (for example, while putting on a  
new piece of clothing. eating a seasonal fruit for the first time that year, seeing  
powerful lightning, hearing bad news, etc.) Some of these occasional prayers serve to  
inculcate hatred and s[[corn]] for all Gentiles, We have mentioned in Chapter 2 the rule  
according to which a pious Jew must utter curse when passing near a Gentile  
cemetery, whereas he must bless God when passing near a Jewish cemetery. A similar  
rule applies to the living; thus, when seeing a large Jewish population a devout Jew  
must praise God, while upon seeing a large Gentile population he must utter a curse.  
Nor are buildings exempt: the Talmud lays down (63) that a Jew who passes near an  
inhabited non-Jewish dwelling must ask God to destroy it, whereas if the building is  
in ruins he must thank the Lord of Vengeance. (Naturally, the rules are reversed for  
Jewish houses.) This rule was easy to keep for Jewish peasants who lived in their own  
villages or for small urban communities living in all-Jewish townships or quarters.

Under the conditions of classical Judaism, however, it became impracticable and was  
therefore confined to churches and places of worship of other religions (except  
Islam). (64) In this connection, the rule was further embroidered by custom: it  
became customary to spit (usually three times) upon seeing a church or a crucifix, as  
an embellishment to the obligatory formula of regret. (65) Sometimes insulting  
biblical verses were also added. (66)

There is also a series of rules forbidding any expression of praise for Gentiles or  
for their deeds, except where such praise implies an even greater praise of Jews and  
things Jewish. This rule is still observed by Orthodox Jews. For example. the writer  
Agnon, when interviewed on the [[Israel]]i radio upon his return from Stockholm, where  
he received the Nobel Prize for literature, praised the Swedish Academy, but hastened  
to add: 'I am not forgetting that it is forbidden to praise Gentiles, but here there is a  
special reason for my praise' - that is, that they awarded the prize to a Jew.

Similarly, it is forbidden to join any manifestation of popular Gentile rejoicing,  
except where failing to join in might cause 'hostility' towards Jews, in which case a  
'minimal' show of joy is allowed.

In addition to the rules mentioned so far, there are many others whose effect is  
to inhibit human friendship between

\[94\] Jew and Gentile. I shall mention two examples: the rule on 'libation wine' and  
that on preparing food for a Gentile on Jewish holy days.

A religious Jew must not drink any wine in whose preparation a Gentile had any  
part whatsoever. Wine in an open bottle, even if prepared wholly by Jews, becomes  
banned if a Gentile so much as touches the bottle or passes a hand over it. The reason  
given by the rabbis is that all Gentiles are not only idolators but must be presumed to  
be malicious to boot, so that they are likely to dedicate (by a whisper, gesture or  
thought) as 'libation' to their idol any wine which a Jew is about to drink. This law  
applies in full force to all Christians, and in a slightly attenuated form also to  
Muslims. (An open bottle of wine touched by a Christian must be poured away, but if  
touched by a Muslim it can be sold or given away, although it may not be drunk by a  
Jew.) The law applies equally to Gentile atheists (how can one be sure that they are  
not merely pretending to be atheists?) but not to Jewish atheists.

The laws against doing work on the sabbath apply to a lesser extent on other  
holy days. In particular, on a holy day which does not happen to fall on a Saturday it  
is permitted to do any work required for preparing food to be eaten during the holy  
days or days. Legally, this is defined as preparing a 'soul's food' (okhel nefesh); but  
'soul' is interpreted to mean 'Jew', and 'Gentiles and dogs' are explicitly excluded.  
(67) There is, however, a dispensation in favor of powerful Gentiles, whose hostility  
can be dangerous: it is permitted to cook food on a holy day for a visitor belonging to  
this category, provided he is not actively encouraged to come and eat.

An important effect of all these laws - quite apart from their application in  
practice - is in the attitude created by their constant study which, as part of the study  
of the Halakhah, is regarded by classical Judaism as a supreme religious duty. Thus  
an Orthodox Jew learns from his earliest youth, as part of his sacred studies, that

Gentiles are compared to dogs, that it is a sin to praise them, and so on and so forth.  
As a matter of fact, in this respect textbooks for beginners have a worse effect than  
the Talmud and the great talmudic codes. One reason for this is that such elementary  
texts give more detailed explanations, phrased so as to in[[flu]]ence young and  
uneducated minds. Out of a large number of such texts, I have chosen the one which  
is currently most popular in [[Israel]] and has been reprinted in many cheap editions,  
heavily subsidized by the [[Israel]]i [[government]]. It is The Book of Education, written by  
an anonymous rabbi in early 14th century [[Spain]]. It explains the 613 religious

\[95\] obligations (mitzvot) of Judaism in the order in which they are supposed to be  
found in the Pentateuch according to the talmudic interpretation (discussed in  
Chapter 3). It owes its lasting in[[flu]]ence and popularity to the clear and easy Hebrew  
style in which it is written.

A central didactic aim of this book is to emphasize the 'correct' meaning of the  
Bible with respect to such terms as 'fellow', 'friend' or 'man' (which we have referred  
to in Chapter 3). Thus §219, devoted to the religious obligation arising from the verse  
'thou shalt love thy fellow as thyself', is entitled: 'A religious obligation to love Jews',  
and explains:

    To love every Jew strongly means that we should care for a Jew and his money
    just as one cares for oneself and one's own money, for it is written: 'thou shalt love
    thy fellow as thyself' and our sages of blessed memory said: 'what is hateful to you do
    not do to your friend' ... and many other religious obligations follow from this,
    because one who loves one's friend as oneself will not steal his money, or commit
    adultery with his wife, or defraud him of his money, or deceive him verbally, or steal
    his land, or harm him in any way. Also many other religious obligations depend on
    this, as is known to any reasonable man.
    

In §322, dealing with the duty to keep a Gentile slave enslaved for ever  
(whereas a Jewish slave must be set free after seven years), the following explanation  
is given:

    And at the root of this religious obligation [is the fact that] the Jewish people
    are the best of the human species, created to know their Creator and worship Him,
    and worthy of having [[slaves]] to serve them. And if they will not have [[slaves]] of other
    peoples, they would have to enslave their brothers, who would thus be unable to
    serve the Lord, blessed be He. Therefore we are commanded to possess those for our
    service, after they are prepared for this and after idolatory is removed from their
    speech so that there should not be danger in our houses, (68) and this is the
    intention of the verse 'but over your brethren the [[child]]ren of [[Israel]], ye shall not rule
    one over another with rigor', (69) so that you will not have to enslave your brothers,
    who are all ready to worship God.
    

In §545, dealing with the religious obligation to exact interest on money lent to  
Gentiles, the law is stated as follows: 'That we are commanded to demand interest  
from Gentiles when we lend money to them, and we must not lend to them without  
interest,' The explanation is:

    And at the root of this religious obligation is that we should not do any act of
    mercy except to the people who know God and worship Him; and when we refrain
    

from doing merciful  
\[96\]  
deed to the rest of mankind and do so only to the former, we are being tested that  
the main part of love and mercy to them is because they follow the religion of God,  
blessed be He. Behold, with this intention our reward \[from God\] when we withhold  
mercy from the others is equal to that for doing \[merciful deeds\] to members of our  
own people.

Similar distinctions are made in numerous other passages. In explaining the  
ban against delaying a worker's wage (§238) the author is careful to point out that the  
sin is less serious if the worker is Gentile. The prohibition against cursing (§239) is  
entitled 'Not to curse any Jew, whether man or woman. Similarly, the prohibitions  
against giving misleading advice, hating other people, shaming them or taking  
revenge on them (§§240, 245, 246, 247) apply only to fellow-Jews.

The ban against following Gentile customs (§262) means that Jews must not  
only 'remove themselves' from Gentiles, but also 'speak ill of all their behavior, even  
of their dress'.

It must be emphasized that the explanations quoted above do represent  
correctly the teaching of the Halakhah. The rabbis and, even worse, the apologetic  
'scholars of Judaism' know this very well and for this reason they do not try to argue  
against such views inside the Jewish community; and of course they never mention  
them outside it. Instead, they vilify any Jew who raises these matters within earshot  
of Gentiles, and they issue deceitful denials in which the art of equivocation reaches  
its summit. For example, they state, using general terms, the importance which  
Judaism attaches to mercy; but what they forget to point out is that according to the  
Halakhah 'mercy' means mercy towards Jews.

Anyone who lives in [[Israel]] knows how deep and widespread these attitudes of  
hatred and cruelty to towards all Gentiles are among the majority of [[Israel]]i Jews.  
Normally these attitudes are disguised from the outside world, but since the  
establishment of the State of [[Israel]], the [[1967]] war and the rise of Begin, a significant  
minority of Jews, both in [[Israel]] and abroad, have gradually become more open about  
such matters. In recent years the inhuman precepts according to which servitude is  
the 'natural' lot of Gentiles have been publicly quoted in [[Israel]], even on TV, by Jewish  
farmers exploiting Arab labor, particularly [[child]] labor. Gush Emunim leaders have  
quoted religious precepts which enjoin Jews to oppress Gentiles, as a justification of  
the attempted [[assassination]] of Palestinian mayors and as divine authority for their  
own plan to expel all the Arabs from Palestine.

While many zionists reject these positions politically, their standard counter-  
arguments are based on considerations of expediency and Jewish self-interest, rather  
than on universally valid

\[97\] principles of humanism and ethics. For example, they argue that the exploitation  
and oppression of Palestinians by [[Israel]]is tends to corrupt [[Israel]]i society, or that the  
expulsion of the Palestinians is impracticable under present political conditions, or  
that [[Israel]]i acts of terror against the Palestinians tend to isolate [[Israel]] internationally.  
In principle, however, virtually all zionists - and in particular 'left' zionists - share the

deep anti-Gentile attitudes which Orthodox Judaism keenly promotes.

Attitudes to Christianity and Islam

In the foregoing, several examples of the rabbinical attitudes to these two  
religions were given in passing. But it will be useful to summarize these attitudes  
here.

Judaism is imbued with a very deep hatred towards Christianity, combined with  
ignorance about it. This attitude was clearly aggravated by the Christian persecutions  
of Jews, but is largely independent of them. In fact, it dates from the time when  
Christianity was still weak and persecuted (not least by Jews), and it was shared by  
Jews who had never been persecuted by Christians or who were even helped by them.  
Thus, Maimonides was subjected to Muslim persecutions by the regime of the  
Almohads and escaped from them first to the crusaders' [[King]]dom of Jerusalem, but  
this did not change his views in the least. This deeply negative attitude is based on  
two main elements.

First, on hatred and malicious slanders against Jesus. The traditional view of  
Judaism on Jesus must of course be sharply distinguished from the nonsensical  
controversy between antisemites and Jewish apologists concerning the  
'responsibility' for his execution. Most modern scholars of that period admit that due  
to the lack of original and contemporary accounts, the late composition of the  
Gospels and the contradictions between them, accurate historical knowledge of the  
circumstances of Jesus' execution is not available. In any case, the notion of collective  
and inherited guilt is both wicked and absurd. However, what is at issue here is not  
the actual facts about Jesus, but the inaccurate and even slanderous reports in the  
Talmud and post-talmudic literature - which is what Jews believed until the 19th  
century and many, especially in [[Israel]], still believe. For these reports certainly played  
an important role in forming the Jewish attitude to Christianity.

According to the Talmud, Jesus was executed by a proper rabbinical court for  
idolatry, inciting other Jews to idolatry, and contempt of rabbinical authority. All  
classical Jewish sources which mention his execution are quite happy to take  
responsibility

\[98\] for it; in the talmudic account the [[Roma]]ns are not even mentioned.

The more popular accounts - which were nevertheless taken quite seriously -  
such as the notorious Toldot Yeshu are even worse, for in addition to the above  
crimes they accuse him of witchcraft. The very name 'Jesus' was for Jews a symbol of  
all that is abominable, and this popular tradition still persists. (70) The Gospels are  
equally detested, and they are not allowed to be quoted (let alone taught) even in  
modern [[Israel]]i Jewish schools.

Secondly, for theological reasons, mostly rooted in ignorance, Christianity as a  
religion is classed by rabbinical teaching as idolatry. This is based on a crude  
interpretation of the Christian doctrines on the Trinity and [[Inca]]rnation. All the  
Christian emblems and pictorial representations are regarded as 'idols' - even by

those Jews who literally worship scrolls, stones or personal belongings of 'Holy Men'.

The attitude of Judaism towards Islam is, in contrast, relatively mild. Although  
the stock epithet given to Muhammad is 'madman' (meshugga), this was not nearly  
as offensive as it may sound now, and in any case it pales before the abusive terms  
applied to Jesus. Similarly, the Qur'an - unlike the [[New]] Testament - is not  
condemned to burning. It is not honored in the same way as Islamic law honors the  
Jewish sacred scrolls, but is treated as an ordinary book. Most rabbinical authorities  
agree that Islam is not idolatry (although some leaders of Gush Emunim now choose  
to ignore this). Therefore the Halakhah decrees that Muslims should not be treated  
by Jews any worse than 'ordinary' Gentiles. But also no better. Again, Maimonides  
can serve as an illustration. He explicitly states that Islam is not idolatry, and in his  
philosophical works he quotes, with great respect, many Islamic philosophical  
authorities. He was, as I have mentioned before, personal physician to Saladin and  
his family, and by Saladin's order he was appointed Chief over all [[Egypt]]'s Jews. Yet,  
the rules he lays down against saving a Gentile's life (except in order to avert danger  
to Jews) apply equally to Muslims.

#### Political Consequences

The persistent attitudes of classical Judaism toward non-Jews strongly  
in[[flu]]ence its followers, Orthodox Jews and those who can be regarded as its  
continuators, Zionists. Through the latter it also in[[flu]]ences the policies of the State of  
[[Israel]]. Since [[1967]], as [[Israel]] becomes more and more 'Jewish', so its policies are  
in[[flu]]enced more by Jewish ideological considerations than by those of a coldly  
conceived imperial interest. This ideological in[[flu]]ence is not usually perceived by  
foreign experts, who tend to ignore or downplay the in[[flu]]ence of the Jewish religion  
on [[Israel]]i policies. This explains why many of their predictions are incorrect.

In fact, more [[Israel]]i [[government]] crises are caused by religious reasons, often  
trivial, than by any other cause. The space devoted by the Hebrew press to discussion  
of the constantly occurring quarrels between the various religious groups, or between  
the religious and the secular, is greater than that given any other subject, except in  
times of war or of security-related tension. At the time of writing, early [[August]] [[1993]],  
some topics of major interest to readers of the Hebrew press are: whether soldiers  
[[kill]]ed in action who are sons of non-Jewish mothers will be buried in a segregated  
area in [[Israel]]i military cemeteries; whether Jewish religious burial associations, who  
have a monopoly over the burial of all Jews except kibbutz members, will be allowed  
to continue their custom of circumcising the corpses of non-circumcised Jews before  
burying them (and without asking the family's permission); whether the import of  
non-kosher meat to [[Israel]], banned unofficially since the establishment of the state,  
will be allowed or banned by law. There are many more issues of this kind which are  
of a much greater interest to the [[Israel]]i- Jewish public than, let us say, the  
negotiations with the Palestinians and Syria.

The attempts made by a few [[Israel]]i politicians to ignore the factors of 'Jewish  
ideology' in favor of purely imperial interests have led to disastrous results. In early  
[[1974]], after its partial defeat in the Yom Kippur [[War]], [[Israel]] had a vital interest in  
stopping the renewed in[[flu]]ence of the PLO, which had not yet been recognized by the  
Arab states as the solely legitimate [[representative]] of the Palestinians. The [[Israel]]i  
[[government]] conceived of a plan to support Jordanian in[[flu]]ence in

\[100\] the West Bank, which was quite considerable at the time. When [[King]] Hussein  
was asked for his support, he demanded a visible quid pro quo. It was arranged that  
his chief West Bank supporter, Sheikh Jabri of Hebron, who ruled the southern part  
of the West Bank with an iron fist and with approval of then Defense minister Moshe  
Dayan, would give a party for the region's notables in the courtyard of his palatial  
residence in Hebron. The party, in honor of the king's birthday, would feature the  
public display of Jordanian flags and would begin a pro-Jordanian campaign. But the

religious settlers in the nearby Kiryat-Arba, who were only a handful at the time,  
heard about the plan and threatened Prime Minister Golda Meir and Dayan with  
vigorous [[[[protest]]s]] since, as they put it, displaying a flag of a 'non-Jewish state' within  
the Land of [[Israel]] contradicts the sacred principle which states that this land 'belongs'  
only to Jews. Since this principle is accepted by all zionists, the [[government]] had to  
bow to their demands and order Sheikh Jabri not to display any Jordanian flags.  
Thereupon Jabri, who was deeply humiliated, canceled the party and, at the Fez  
meeting of the Arab League which occurred soon after, [[King]] Hussein voted to  
recognize the PLO as the sole [[representative]] of the Palestinians. For the bulk of  
[[Israel]]i-Jewish public the current negotiations about 'autonomy' are likewise  
in[[flu]]enced more by such Jewish ideological considerations than by any others.

The conclusion from this consideration of [[Israel]]i policies, supported by an  
analysis of classical Judaism, must be that analyses of [[Israel]]i policy-making which do  
not emphasize the importance of its unique character as a 'Jewish state' must be  
mistaken. In particular, the facile comparison of [[Israel]] to other cases of [[Western]]  
imperialism or to settler states, is incorrect. During apartheid, the land of [[South]]  
[[Africa]] was officially divided into 87 per cent which 'belonged' to the [[white]]s and 13 per  
cent which was said officially to 'belong' to the Blacks. In addition, officially sovereign  
states, embodied with all the symbols of [[sovereignty]], the so-called Bantustans, were  
established. But 'Jewish ideology' demands that no part of the Land of [[Israel]] can be  
recognized as 'belonging' to non-Jews and that 110 signs of [[sovereignty]], such as  
Jordanian flags, can be officially allowed to be displayed. The principle of  
Redemption of the Land demands that ideally all the land, and not merely, say, 87  
per cent, will in time be 'redeemed', that is, become owned by Jews. 'Jewish ideology  
prohibits that very convenient principle of imperialism, already known to [[Roma]]ns  
and followed by so many secular [[empire]]s, and best formulated by Lord Cromer: 'We  
do not govern [[Egypt]], we govern the governors of [[Egypt]].' Jewish

\[101\] ideology forbids such recognition; it also forbids a seemingly respectful attitude  
to any 'non-Jewish governors' within the Land of [[Israel]]. The entire apparatus of client  
kings, sultans, maharajas and chiefs or, in more modern times, of dependent  
dictators, so convenient in other cases of imperial hegemony, cannot be used by  
[[Israel]] within the area considered part of the Land of [[Israel]]. Hence the fears,  
commonly expressed by Palestinians, of being offered a 'Bantustan' are totally  
groundless. Only if numerous Jewish lives are lost in war, as happened both in [[1973]]  
and in the [[1983]]-5 war aftermath in [[Lebanon]], is an [[Israel]]i retreat conceivable since it  
can be justified by the principle that the sanctity of Jewish life is more important than  
other considerations. What is not possible, as long as [[Israel]] remains a 'Jewish state',  
is the [[Israel]]i grant of a fake, but nevertheless symbolically real [[sovereignty]], or even of  
real autonomy, to non-Jews within the Land of [[Israel]] for merely political reasons.  
[[Israel]], like some other countries, is an exclusivist state, but [[Israel]]i exclusivism is  
peculiar to itself.

In addition to [[Israel]]i policies it may be surmised that the 'Jewish ideology'  
in[[flu]]ences also a significant part, maybe a majority, of the diaspora Jews. While the  
actual implementation of Jewish ideology depends on [[Israel]] being strong, this in turn  
depends to a considerable extent on the support which diaspora Jews, particularly US  
Jews, give to [[Israel]]. The image of the diaspora Jews and their attitudes to non-Jews,  
is quite different from the attitudes of classical Judaism, as described above. This

discrepancy is most obvious in English-speaking countries, where the greatest  
falsifications of Judaism regularly occur. The situation is worst in the [[USA]] and  
[[Canada]], the two states whose support for [[Israel]]i policies, including policies which  
most glaringly contradict the basic human rights of non-Jews, is strongest.

US support for [[Israel]], when considered not in abstract but in concrete detail,  
cannot be adequately explained only as a result of [[America]]n imperial interests. The  
strong in[[flu]]ence wielded by the organized Jewish community in the [[USA]] in support  
of all [[Israel]]i policies must also be taken into account in order to explain the Middle  
East policies of [[America]]n Administrations. This phenomenon is even more noticeable  
in the case of [[Canada]], whose Middle [[Eastern]] interests cannot be considered as  
important, but whose loyal dedication to [[Israel]] is even greater than that of the [[USA]] In  
both countries (and also in [[France]], [[Britain]] and many other states) Jewish  
organizations support [[Israel]] with about the same loyalty which communist parties  
accorded to the USSR for so long. Also, many Jews who appear to be active in  
defending human

\[102\] rights and who adopt non-conformist views on other issues do, in cases  
affecting [[Israel]], display a remarkable degree of totalitarianism and are in the  
forefront of the defense of all [[Israel]]i policies. It is well known in [[Israel]] that the  
chauvinism and fanaticism in supporting [[Israel]] displayed by organized diaspora Jews  
is much greater (especially since [[1967]]) than the chauvinism shown by an average  
[[Israel]]i Jew. This fanaticism is especially marked in [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] but because  
of the incomparably greater political importance of the [[USA]], I will concentrate on the  
latter. It should, however, be noted that we also find Jews whose views of [[Israel]]i  
policies are not different from those held by the rest of the society (with due regard to  
the factors of geography, income, social position and so on).

Why should some [[America]]n Jews display chauvinism, some-times extreme, and  
others not? We should begin by observing the social and therefore also the political  
importance of the Jewish organizations which are of an exclusive nature: they admit  
no non-Jews on principle. (This exclusivism is in amusing contrast with their hunt to  
condemn the most obscure non-Jewish club which refuses to admit Jews.) Those who  
can be called 'organized Jews', and who spend most of their time outside work hours  
mostly in the [[company]] of other Jews, can be presumed to uphold Jewish exclusivism  
and to preserve the attitudes of the classical Judaism to non-Jews. Under present  
circumstances they cannot openly express these attitudes toward non-Jews in the  
[[USA]] where non-Jews constitute more than 97 per cent of the population. They  
compensate for this by ex- pressing their real attitudes in their support of the 'Jewish  
state' and the [[treatment]] it metes to the non-Jews of the Middle East.

How else can we explain the enthusiasm displayed by so many [[America]]n rabbis  
in support of, let us say, Martin Luther [[King]], compared with their lack of support for  
the rights of Palestinians, even for their individual human rights? How else can we  
explain the glaring contradiction between the attitudes of classical Judaism toward  
non-Jews, which include the rule that their lives should not be saved except for the  
sake of Jewish interest, with the support of the US rabbis and organized Jews for the  
rights of the Blacks? After all, Martin Luther [[King]] and the majority of [[America]]n  
Blacks are non-Jews. Even if only the conservative and Orthodox Jews, who together  
constitute the majority of organized [[America]]n Jews, are considered to hold such

opinions about the non-Jews, the other part of organized US Jewry, the Reform, had  
never opposed them, and, in my view, show themselves to be quite in[[flu]]enced by  
them.

    Actually the explanation of this apparent contradiction is
    

\[103\] easy. It should be recalled that Judaism, especially in its classical form, is  
totalitarian in nature. The behavior of supporters of other totalitarian ideologies of  
our times was not different from that of the organized [[America]]n Jews. Stalin and his  
supporters never tired of condemning the discrimination against the [[America]]n or the  
[[South]] [[Africa]]n Blacks, especially in the midst of the worst crimes committed within  
the USSR. The [[South]] [[Africa]]n apartheid regime was tireless in its denunciations of the  
violations of human rights committed either by communist or by other [[Africa]]n  
regimes, and so were its supporters in other countries. Many similar examples can be  
given. The support of democracy or of human rights is there- fore meaningless or  
even harmful and deceitful when it does not begin with self-critique and with support  
of human rights when they are violated by one's own group. Any support of human  
rights in general by a Jew which does not include the support of human rights of non-  
Jews whose rights are being violated by the 'Jewish state' is as deceitful as the  
support of human rights by a Stalinist. The apparent enthusiasm displayed by  
[[America]]n rabbis or by the Jewish organizations in the [[USA]] during the [[1950]]s and the  
[[1960]]s in support of the Blacks in the [[South]], was motivated only by considerations of  
Jewish self-interest, just as was the communist support for the same Blacks. Its  
purpose in both cases was to try to capture the Black community politically, in the  
Jewish case to an unthinking support of [[Israel]]i policies in the Middle East.

Therefore, the real test facing both [[Israel]]i and diaspora Jews is the test of their  
self-criticism which must include the critique of the Jewish past. The most important  
part of such a critique must be detailed and honest confrontation of the Jewish  
attitude to non-Jews. This is what many Jews justly demand from non-Jews: to  
confront their own past and so become aware of the discrimination and persecutions  
inflicted on the Jews. In the last 40 years the number of non-Jews [[kill]]ed by Jews is by  
far greater than the number of the Jews [[kill]]ed by non-Jews. The extent of the  
persecution and discrimination against non-Jews inflicted by the 'Jewish state' with  
the support of organized diaspora Jews is also enormously greater than the suffering  
inflicted on Jews by regimes hostile to the~ Although the struggle against  
antisemitism (and of all other forms of [[racism]]) should never cease, the struggle  
against Jewish chauvinism and exclusivism, which must include a critique of classical  
Judaism, is now of equal or greater importance.

Chapter 2: Prejudice and Prevarication

1 The Jews themselves universally described themselves as a religious community or,  
to be precise, a religious nation. 'Our people is a people only because of the Torah  
(Religious Law)'-this saying by one of the highest authorities, Rabbi Sa'adia Hagga'on  
who lived in the 10th century, has become proverbial.

2 By Emperor Joseph II in [[1782]].

3 All this is usually omitted in vulgar Jewish historiography, in order to propagate the  
myth that the Jews kept their religion by miracle or by some peculiar mystic force.

4 For example, in her Origins of Totalitarianism, a considerable part of which is  
devoted to Jews.

5 Before the end of the 18th century, German Jews were allowed by their rabbis to  
write German in Hebrew letters only, on pain of being excommunicated, flogged, etc.

6 When by a deal between the [[Roma]]n Empire and the Jewish leaders (the dynasty of  
the Nesi 'im) all the Jews in the Empire were subjected to the fiscal and disciplinary  
authority of these leaders and their rabbinical courts, who for their part undertook to  
keep order among the Jews.

7 I write this, being a non-socialist myself. But I will honor and respect people with  
whose principles I disagree, if they make an honest effort to be true to their  
principles. In contrast, there is nothing so despicable as the dishonest use of  
universal principles, whether true or false, for the selfish ends of an individual or,  
even worse, of a group.

8 In fact, many aspects of orthodox Judaism were apparently derived from Sparta,  
through the baneful political in[[flu]]ence of Plato. On this subject, see the excellent  
comments of Moses Hadas, Hellenistic Culture, Fusion and Diffusion, Columbia

University Press, [[New]] York, [[1959]].

9 Including the geography of Palestine and indeed its very location. This is shown by  
the orientation of all synagogues in countries such as [[Poland]] and [[Russia]]: Jews are  
supposed to pray facing Jerusalem, and the [[Europe]]an Jews, who had only a vague  
idea where Jerusalem was, always assumed it was due east, whereas for them it was  
in fact more nearly due south.

10 Throughout this chapter I use the term 'classical Judaism' to refer to rabbinical  
Judaism as it emerged after about AD 800 and lasted up to the end of the 18th  
century. I avoid the term 'normative Judaism', which many authors use with roughly  
the same meaning, because in my view it has unjustified connotations.

11 The works of Hellenistic Jews, such as Philo of Alexandria, constitute an  
exception. They were written before classical Judaism achieved a position of exclusive  
hegemony. They were indeed subsequently suppressed among the Jews and survived  
only because Christian monks found them congenial.

12 During the whole period from AD 100 to [[1500]] there were written two travel books  
and one [[history]] of talmudic studies - a short, inaccurate and dreary book, written  
moreover by a despised philosopher (Abraham ben-David, [[Spain]], c. 1170).

13 Me'or 'Eynayi'n by 'Azarya de Rossi of Ferrara, [[Italy]], [[1574]],

14 The best known cases were in [[Spain]]; for example (to use their adopted Christian  
names) Master Alfonso of Valladolid, converted in 1320, and Paul of Santa Marja,  
converted in 1390 and appointed bishop of Burgos in 1415. But many other cases can  
be cited from all over west [[Europe]].

15 Certainly the tone, and also the consequences, were very much better than in  
disputations in which Christians were accused of heresy - for example those in which  
Peter Abelard or the strict Franciscans were condemned.

16 The stalinist and [[Chinese]] examples are sufficiently well known. However, it is  
worth mentioning that the persecution of honest historians in Germany began very  
early. In [[1874]], H. Ewald, a professor at Goettingen, was im[[prison]]ed for expressing  
'incorrect' views on the conquests of Frederick II, a hundred years earlier. The  
situation in [[Israel]] is analogous: the worst attacks against me were provoked not by  
the violent terms I employ in my condemnations of Zionism and the oppression of  
Palestinians, but by an early article of mine about the role of Jews in the slave [[trade]],  
in which the latest case quoted dated from [[1870]]. That article was published before  
the [[1967]] war; nowadays its publication would be impossible.

17 In the end a few other passages also had to be removed, such as those which  
seemed theologically absurd (for example, where God is said to pray to Himself or  
physically to carry out some of the practices enjoined on the individual Jew) or those  
which celebrated too freely the sexual escapades of ancient rabbis.

22 I am happy to say that in a recent new translation (Chicago University Press) the  
word 'Blacks' does appear, but the heavy and very expensive volume is unlikely, as  
yet, to get into the 'wrong' hands. Similarly, in early 19th century England, radical  
books (such as Godwin's) were allowed to appear, provided they were issued in a very  
expensive edition.

23 An additional fact can be mentioned in this connection. It was perfectly possible,  
and apparently respectable, for a Jewish scholar of Islam, Bernard Lewis (who  
formerly taught in London and is now teaching in the [[USA]]) to publish an article in  
Encounter, in which he points out many passages in Islamic literature which in his  
view are anti-Black, but none of which even approaches the passage quoted above. It  
would be quite impossible for anyone now, or in the last thirty years, to discuss in any  
reputable [[America]]n publication the above passage or the many other offensive anti-  
Black talmudic passages. But without a criticism of all sides the attack on Islam alone  
reduces to mere slander.

Chapter 3: Orthodoxy and Interpretation

1 As in Chapter 2, I use the term 'classical Judaism' to refer to rabbinical Judaism in  
the period from about AD 800 up to the end of the 18th century. This period broadly  
coincides with the Jewish Middle Ages, since for most Jewish communities medieval  
conditions persisted much longer than for the west [[Europe]]an nations, namely up to  
the period of the [[French]] Revolution. Thus what I call 'classical Judaism' can be  
regarded as medieval Judaism.

2 Exodus, 15:11.

3 Ibid., 20:3-6.

4 Jeremiah, 10; the same theme is echoed still later by the Second Isaiah, see Isaiah,

5 The cabbala is of course an esoteric doctrine, and its detailed study was confined to  
scholars. In [[Europe]], especially after about [[1750]], extreme measures were taken to  
keep it secret and forbid its study except by mature scholars and under strict  
supervision. The uneducated Jewish masses of eastern [[Europe]] had no real knowledge  
of cabbalistic doctrine; but the cabbala percolated to them in the form of superstition

and magic practices.

6 Many contemporary Jewish mystics believe that the same end may be  
accomplished more quickly by war against the Arabs, by the expulsion of the  
Palestinians, or even by establishing many Jewish settlements on the West Bank. The  
growing movement for building the Third Temple is also based on such ideas.

7 The Hebrew word used here - yihud, meaning literally union-in-seclusion - is the  
same one employed in legal texts (dealing with marriage etc.) to refer to sexual  
intercourse.

8 The so-called Qedusbab Sblisbit (Third Holiness), inserted in the prayer Uva  
Letzion towards the end of the morning service.Numbers, 29. 9-10 The power of  
Satan, and his connection with non-Jews, is illustrated by a widespread custom,  
established under cabbalistic in[[flu]]ence in many Jewish communities from the 17th  
century. A Jewish woman returning from her monthly ritual bath of purification  
(after which sexual intercourse with her husband is mandatory) must beware of  
meeting one of the four satanic creatures: Gentile, pig, dog or donkey. If she does  
meet any one of them she must take another bath. The custom was advocated (among  
others) by Shn'et Musar, a book on Jewish moral conduct first published in [[1712]],  
which was one of the most popular books among Jews in both eastern [[Europe]] and  
Islamic countries until early this century, and is still widely read in some Orthodox  
circles.

11 This is prescribed in minute detail. For example, the ritual hand washing must not  
be done under a tap; each hand must be washed singly, in water from a mug (of  
prescribed minimal size) held in the other hand. If one's hands are really dirty, it is  
quite impossible to clean them in this way, but such pragmatic considerations are  
obviously irrelevant. Classical Judaism prescribes a great number of such detailed  
rituals, to which the cabbala attaches deep significance. There are, for example, many  
precise rules concerning behavior in a lavatory. A Jew relieving nature in an open  
space must not do so in a [[North]]-[[South]] direction, because [[North]] is associated with  
Satan.

12 'Interpretation' is my own expression. The classical (and present-day Orthodox)  
view is that the talmudic meaning, even where it is contrary to the literal sense, was  
always the operational one.

13 According to an apocryphal story, a famous 19th century Jewish heretic observed  
in this connection that the verse Thou shalt not commit adultery' is repeated only  
twice. 'Presumably one is therefore forbidden to eat adultery or to cook it, but  
enjoying it is all right.'

14 The Hebrew re'akha is rendered by the [[King]] James Version (and most other  
English translations) somewhat imprecisely as 'thy neighbor'. See however II Samuel,  
16:17, where exactly the same word is rendered by the [[King]] James Version more  
correctly as 'thy friend'.

15 The Mishnah is remarkably free of all this, and in particular the belief in demons

and witchcraft is relatively rare in it. The Babylonian Talmud, on the other hand, is  
full of gross superstitions.

16 Or, to be precise, in many parts of Palestine. Apparently the areas to which the law  
applies are those where there was Jewish demographic predominance around AD  
150-200.

17 Therefore non-zionist Orthodox Jews in [[Israel]] organize special shops during  
sabbatical years, which sell fruits and vegetables grown by Arabs on Arab land.

18 In the winter of [[1945]]-6,1 myself, then a boy under 13, participated in such  
proceedings. The man in charge of agricultural work in the religious agricultural  
school I was men attending was a particularly pious Jew and thought it would be safe  
if the crucial act, that of removing the board, should be performed by an orphan  
under 13 years old, incapable of being, or making anyone else, guilty of a sin. (A boy  
under that age cannot be guilty of a sin; his father, if he has one, is considered  
responsible.) Everything was carefully explained to me beforehand, including the  
duty to say, 'I need this board,' when in fact it was not needed.

19 For example, the Talmud forbids a Jew to enjoy the light of a candle lit by a  
Gentile on the sabbath, unless the latter had lit it for his own use before the Jew  
entered the room.

20 One of my uncles in pre-[[1939]] [[[[War]]saw]] used a subtler method. He employed a non-  
Jewish maid called Marysia and it was his custom upon waking from his Saturday  
siesta to say, first quietly, 'How nice it would be if' - and then, raising his voice to a  
shout, '... Marysia would bring us a cup of tea!' He was held to be a very pious and  
God fearing man and would never dream of drinking a drop of milk for a full six  
hours after eating meat. In his kitchen he had two sinks, one for washing up dishes  
used for eating meat, the other for milk dishes.

21 Occasionally regrettable mistakes occur, because some of these jobs are quite  
cushy, allowing the employee six days off each week. The town of Bney Braq (near  
Tel-Aviv), inhabited almost exclusively by Orthodox Jews, was shaken in the [[1960]]s by  
a horrible scandal. Upon the [[death]] of the 'sabbath Goy' they had employed for over  
twenty years to watch over their water supplies on Saturdays, it was discovered that  
he was not really a Christian but a Jew! So when his successor, a Druse, was hired,  
the town demanded and obtained from the [[government]] a document certifying that  
the new employee is a Gentile of pure Gentile descent. It is reliably rumored that the  
secret police was asked to [[research]] this matter.

22 In contrast, elementary Scripture teaching can be done for payment. This was  
always considered a low-status job and was badly paid.

23 Another 'extremely important' ritual is the blowing of a ram's horn on Rosh  
Hashanah, whose purpose is to confuse Satan.

Chapter 4: The Weight of History

1 See, for example, Jeremiah, 44, especially verses 15-19. For an excellent [[treatment]]  
of certain aspects of this subject see Raphael Patai, The Hebrew Goddess, Ktav, [[USA]],

2 Ezra, 7:25-26. The last two chapters of this book are mainly concerned with Ezra's  
efforts to segregate the 'pure' Jews ('the holy seed') away from 'the people of the land'  
(who were themselves at least partly of Jewish descent) and break up mixed  
marriages.

3 W.F. Albright, Recent Discoveries in Bible lands, Funk & Wagnall, [[New]] York, [[1955]],  
p.103.

4 It is significant that, together with this literary corpus, all the historical books  
written by Jews after about 400 BC were also rejected. Until the 19th century, Jews  
were quite ignorant of the story of Massadah and of figures such as Judas  
Maccabaeus, now regarded by many (particularly by Christians) as belonging to the  
'very essence' of Judaism.

5 Acts, 18:15.

6 Ibid., 25.

7 See note 6 to Chapter 2.

8 Concerning the term 'classical Judaism' see note 10 to Chapter 2 and note 1 to  
Chapter 3.

9 Nobel Prize winners Agnon and Bashevis Singer are examples of this, but many  
others can be given, particularly Bialik, the national Hebrew poet. In his famous  
poem My Father he describes his saintly father selling vodka to the drunkard  
peasants who are depicted as animals. This very popular poem, taught in all [[Israel]]i  
schools, is one of the vehicles through which the anti-peasant attitude is reproduced.

10 So far as the central power of the Jewish Patriarchate was concerned, the deal was  
terminated by Theodosius II in a series of laws, culminating in AD 429; but many of  
the local arrangements remained in force.

11 Perhaps another characteristic example is the Parthian [[empire]] (until AD 225) but  
not enough is known about it. We know, however, that the establishment of the  
national [[Iran]]ian Sasanid [[empire]] brought about an immediate decline of the Jews'  
position.

12 This ban extends also to marrying a woman converted to Judaism, because all  
Gentile women are presumed by the Halakhah to be prostitutes.

13 A prohibited marriage is not generally void, and requires a divorce. Divorce is  
nominally a voluntary act on the part of the husband, but under certain  
circumstances a rabbinical court can coerce him to 'will' it (kofin oto 'ad she yyomar  
rotzeh ani).

14 Although Jewish achievements during the Golden Age in Muslim [[Spain]] (1002-

1147.  were more brilliant, they were not lasting. For example, most of the magnificent  
    Hebrew poetry of that age was subsequently forgotten by Jews, and only recovered by  
    them in the 19th or 20th century.

15 During that war, Henry of Trastamara used anti-Jewish propaganda. although his  
own mother, Leonor de Guzman, a high Castilian noblewoman, was partly of Jewish  
descent. (Only in [[Spain]] did the highest nobility intermarry with Jews.) After his  
victory he too employed Jews in the highest financial positions.

16 Until the 18th century the position of serfs in [[Poland]] was generally supposed to be  
even worse than in [[Russia]]. In that century, certain features of [[Russia]]n serfdom, such  
as public sales of serfs, got worse than in [[Poland]] but the central Tsarist [[government]]  
always retained certain powers over the enslaved peasants, for example the right to  
recruit them to the national army.

17 During the preceding period persecutions of Jews were rare. This is true of the  
[[Roma]]n Empire even after serious Jewish [[rebellion]]s. Gibbon is correct in praising the  
liberality of Antonius Pius (and Marcus Aurelius) to Jews, so soon after the major  
Bar-Kokhba [[rebellion]] of AD 132-5.

18 This fact, easily ascertainable by examination of the details of each persecution, is  
not rein~remarked upon by most general historians in recent times. An honorable  
exception is Hugh Trevor-Roper, The Rise of Christian [[Europe]], Thames and Hudson,  
London, [[1965]], pp.173-4. Trevor-Roper is also one of the very few modern historians  
who mention the predominant Jewish role in the early medieval slave [[trade]] between  
Christian (and pagan) [[Europe]] and the Muslim world (ibid., pp.92-3). In order to  
promote this abomination, which I have no space to discuss here, Maimonides  
allowed Jews, in the name of the Jewish religion, to abduct Gentile [[child]]ren into  
[[slavery]]; and his opinion was no doubt acted upon or reflected contemporary practice.

19 Examples can be found in any [[history]] of the crusades. See especially S. Runciman,  
A History of the Crusades, vol I, book 3, chap 1, 'The German Crusade'. The  
subsequent defeat of this host by the Hungarian army, 'to most Christians appeared  
as a just punishment meted out of high to the murderers of the Jews.'

20 John Stoyc, [[Europe]] Unfolding 1 648~8, Fontana, London, p.46.

21 This latter feature is of course not mentioned by received Jewish historiography.  
The usual punishment for a rebellious, or even 'impudent' peasant was impalement.

22 The same can be observed in different regions of a given country. For example, in  
Germany, agrarian Bavaria was much more antisemitic than the industrialized areas.

23 'The refusal of the Church to admit that once a Jew always a Jew, was another  
cause of pain for an ostentatious Catholic like Drumont. One of his chief lieutenants,  
Jules Guérin, has recounted the disgust he felt when the famous Jesuit, Père du Lac,  
remonstrated with him for attacking some converted Jews named Dreyfus.' D.W.  
Brogan, The Development of Modern [[France]], vol 1, Harper Torchbooks, [[New]] York,  
[[1966]], p.227.

24 Ibid..

25 Let me illustrate the irrational, demonic character which [[racism]] can sometimes  
acquire with three examples chosen at random. A major part of the extermination of  
[[Europe]]'s Jews was carried out in [[1942]] and early [[1943]] during the Nazi offensive in  
[[Russia]], which culminated in their defeat at Stalingrad. During the eight months  
between [[June]] [[1942]] and [[February]] [[1943]] the Nazis probably used more railway wagons  
to haul Jews to the gas chambers than to carry much needed supplies to the army.  
Before being taken to their [[death]], most of these Jews, at least in [[Poland]], had been  
very effectively employed in production of equipment for the German army. The  
second, rather remote, example comes from a description of the Sicilian Vespers in  
1282: 'Every [[French]]man they met was struck down. They poured into the inns  
frequented by the [[French]] and the houses where they dwelt, sparing neither man nor  
woman nor [[child]] ... The riots?s broke into the Dominican and Franciscan convents,  
and all the foreign friars were dragged out and told to pronounce the word ciciri,  
whose sound the [[French]] tongue could never accurately reproduce. Anyone who failed  
in the test was slain.' (S. Runciman, The Sicilian Vespers, Cambridge University  
Press,[[1958]], p. 215.) The third example is recent: in the summer of [[1980]] - following an  
[[assassination]] attempt by Jewish terrorists in which [[May]]or Bassam Shak'a of Nablus  
lost both his legs and [[May]]or Karim Khalaf of Ramallah lost a foot - a group of Jewish  
Nazis gathered in the campus of TeI-Aviv University, roasted a few cats and offered  
their meat to passers-by as 'shish-kebab from the legs of the Arab mayors'. Anyone  
who witnessed this macabre orgy - as I did - would have to admit that some horrors  
defy explanation in the present state of knowledge.

26 One of the early quirks of Jabotinsky (founder of the party then led by Begin) was  
to propose, in about [[1912]], the creation of two Jewish states, one in Palestine and the  
other in Angola: the former, being poor in natural resources, would be subsidized by  
the riches of the latter.

27 Herzl went to [[Russia]] to meet von Plehve in [[August]] [[1903]], less than four months  
after the hideous Kishinev pogrom, for which the latter was known to be responsible.  
Herzl pro- posed an [[alliance]], based on their common wish to get most of the Jews out  
of [[Russia]] and, in the shorter term, to divert Jewish support away from the socialist  
movement. The Tsarist minister started the first interview (8 [[August]]) by observing  
that he regarded himself as 'an ardent supporter of zionism'. When Herzl went on to  
describe the aims of zionism, von Plehve interrupted: 'You are preaching to the  
converted'. Amos Elon, Herzel, 'Am 'Oved, [[1976]] pp.415-9, in Hebrew.

28 Dr Joachim Prinz, Wirjuden, Berlin, [[1934]], pp. 150-1.

29 Ibid., pp. 154-5.

30 For example see ibid., p. 136. Even worse expressions of sympathy with Nazism  
were voices by the extremist Lohamey Herut Yisra'el (Stern Gang) as late as [[1941]]. Dr  
Prinz was, in zionist terms, a 'dove'. In the [[1970]]s he even patronized the US Jewish  
movement Breira, until he was dissuaded by Golda Meir.

'seven Noahide precepts' (seven biblical laws considered by the Talmud to be

talmudic and rabbinical sources. Such omissions are marked \[...\]. The rabbi's own  
conclusions are reproduced in full.

12 The Tosafot (literally, Addenda) are a body of scholia to the Talmud, dating from  
the 1 lth-13th centuries.

13 Persons guilty of such crimes are even allowed to rise to high public positions. An  
illustration of this is the case of Shmu'el Lahis, who was responsible for the massacre  
of between 50 and 75 Arab peasants im[[prison]]ed in a mosque after their village had  
been [[conquer]]ed by the [[Israel]]i army during the [[1948]]-9 war. Following a pro forma  
trial, he was granted complete amnesty, thanks to Ben-Gurion's intercession. The  
man went on to become a respected lawyer and in the late [[1970]]s was appointed  
Director General of the Jewish Agency (which is, in effect, the executive of the zionist  
movement). In early [[1978]] the facts concerning his past were widely discussed in the  
[[Israel]]i press, but no rabbi or rabbinical scholar questioned either the amnesty or his  
fitness for his new office. His appointment was not revoked.

21 Thus Professor Jacob Katz, in his Hebrew book Between Jews and Gentiles as well  
as in its more apologetic English version Exclusiveness and Tolerance, quotes only  
this passage verbatim and draws the amazing conclusion that 'regarding the  
obligation to save life no discrimination should be made between Jew and Christian'.  
He does not quote any of the authoritative views I have cited above or in the next  
section.

found abandoned in a town inhabited mainly by Gentiles, a rabbi should be consulted

as to whether the baby should be saved.

24 Tractate Avodah Zarah, p. 26.

25 Maimonides, op. cit., 'Sabbath' 2, 12; Shulhan 'Arukh, 'Orah Hayyim' 330. The  
latter text says 'heathen' rather than 'Gentile' but some of the commentators, such as  
Turey Zahav, stress that this ruling applies 'even to Ishmaelites', that is, to Muslims,  
'who are not idolators'. Christians are not mentioned explicitly in this connection, but  
the ruling must a fortiori apply to them, since - as we shall see below - Islam is  
regarded in a more favorable light than Christianity. See also the responsa of Hatam  
Sofer quoted below.

26 These two examples, from [[Poland]] and [[France]], are reported by Rabbi I.Z. Cahana  
(afterwards professor of Talmud in the religious Bar-Ilan University, [[Israel]]),  
'Medicine in the Halachic post-Talmudic Literature', Sinai, vol 27, [[1950]], p.221. He  
also reports the following case from 19th century [[Italy]]. Until [[1848]], a special law in the  
Papal [[States]] banned Jewish doctors from treating Gentiles. The [[Roma]]n Republic  
established in [[1848]] abolished this law along with all other discriminatory law against  
Jews. But in [[1849]] an expeditionary force sent by [[France]]'s [[President]] Louis Napoleon  
(afterwards Emperor Napoleon III) defeated the Republic and restored [[Pope]] Pius Ix,  
who in [[1850]] revived the anti-Jewish laws. The commanders of the [[French]] garrison,  
disgusted with this extreme reaction, ignored the papal law and hired some Jewish  
doctors to treat their soldiers. The Chief Rabbi of Rome, Moshe Hazan, who was  
himself a doctor, was asked whether a pupil of his, also a doctor, could take a job in a  
[[French]] military hospital despite the risk of having to desecrate the sabbath. The rabbi  
replied that if the conditions of employment expressly mention work on the sabbath,  
he should refuse. But if they do not, he could take the job and employ 'the great  
cleverness of God-fearing Jews.' For example, he could repeat on Saturday the  
prescription given on Friday, by simply telling this to the dispenser. R. Cahana's  
rather frank article, which contains many other examples, is mentioned in the  
bibliography of a book by the former Chief Rabbi of [[Britain]], R. Immanuel Jakobovits,  
Jewish Medical Ethics, Bloch, [[New]] York, [[1962]]; but in the book itself nothing is said  
on this matter.

27 Hokhmat Shlomoh on Shulhan 'Arukh, 'Orah Hayyim' 330, 2.

28 R. Unterman, Ha'aretz, 4 [[April]] [[1966]]. The only qualification he makes - after  
having been subjected to continual pressure - is that in our times any refusal to give  
medical assistance to a Gentile could cause such hostility as might endanger Jewish  
lives.

32 R. Yisra'el Me'ir Kagan - better known as the 'Hafetz Hayyim - complains in his  
Mishnah Berurah, written in [[Poland]] in [[1907]]: 'And know ye that most doctors, even  
the most religious, do not take any heed whatsoever of this law; for they work on the

sabbath and do travel several parasangs to treat a heathen, and they grind  
medicaments with their own hands. And there is no authority for them to do so. For  
although we may find it permissible, because of the fear of hostility, to violate bans  
imposed by the sages - and even this is not clear; yet in bans imposed by the Torah  
itself it must certainly be forbidden for any Jew to do so, and those who transgress  
this prohibition violate the sabbath utterly and may God have mercy on them for  
their sacrilege.' (Commentary on Shulhan 'Arukh, 'Orah Hayyim' 330.) The author is  
generally regarded as the greatest rabbinical authority of his time.

Encyclopedia, 'Goy'.

46 Maimonides, op. cit., ibid., 12, 1-3. As a matter of fact, every Gentile woman is  
regarded as N.Sh.G.Z. - acronym for the Hebrew words niddah, shifhah, goyah,  
zonah (unpurified from menses, slave, Gentile, prostitute). Upon conversion to  
Judaism, she ceases indeed to be niddah, shifhah, goyah but is still considered zonah  
(prostitute) for the rest of her life, simply by virtue of having been born of a Gentile  
mother. In a special category is a woman 'conceived not in holiness but born in  
holiness', that is born to a mother who had converted to Judaism while pregnant. In

order to make quite sure that there are no mix-ups, the rabbis insist that a married  
couple who convert to Judaism together must abstain from marital relations for three  
months.

47 Characteristically, an exception to this generalization is made with respect to  
Gentiles holding legal office relating to financial transactions: notaries, debt  
collectors, bailiff~ and the like. No similar exception is made regarding ordinary  
decent Gentiles, not even if they are friendly towards Jews.

48 Some very early (1st century BC) rabbis called this law 'barbaric' and actually  
returned lost [[property]] belonging to Gentiles. But the law nevertheless remained.

49 Leviticus, 25:14. This is a literal translation of the Hebrew phrase. The [[King]]  
James Version renders this as 'ye shall not oppress one another'; 'oppress' is  
imprecise but 'one another' is a correct rendering of the biblical idiom 'each man his  
brother'. As pointed out in Chapter 3, the Halakhah interprets all such idioms as  
referring exclusively to one's fellow Jew.

50 Shulhan 'Arukh, 'Hoshen Mishpat' 227.

51 This view is advocated by H. Bar-Droma, Wezeh Gvul Ha'aretz (And This Is the  
Border of the Land), Jerusalem, [[1958]]. In recent years this book is much used by the  
[[Israel]]i army in indoctrinating its officers.

57 Numbers 31:13-20; note in particular verse 17: 'Now there- fore [[kill]] every male  
among the little ones, and [[kill]] every woman that hath known man by lying with him.'

58 R. Sha'ul Yisra'eli, 'Taqrit Qibbiya Le'or Hahalakhah' (The Qibbiya incident in the  
light of the Halakhah'), in Hattorab Wehammedinah, vol 5, [[1953]]/4.

59 This is followed by a blessing 'for not making me a slave'. Next, a male must add a  
blessing 'for not making me a woman', and a female 'for making me as He pleased'.

60 In eastern [[Europe]] it was until recent times a universal custom among Jews to spit  
on the floor at this point, as an expression of s[[corn]]. This was not however a strict  
obligation, and today the custom is kept only by the most pious.

61 The Hebrew word is meshummadim, which in rabbinical usage refers to Jews who

become 'idolators', that is either pagan or Christians, but not to Jewish converts to  
Islam.

62 The Hebrew word is minim, whose precise meaning is 'disbelievers in the  
uniqueness of God'.

63 Tractate Berakhot, p. 58b.

64 According to many rabbinical authorities the original rule still applies in full in  
the Land of [[Israel]].

65 This custom gave rise to many incidents in the [[history]] of [[Europe]]an Jewry. One of  
the most famous, whose consequence is still visible today, occurred in 14th century  
Prague. [[King]] Charles IV of Bohemia (who was also Holy [[Roma]]n Emperor) had a  
magnificent crucifix erected in the middle of a stone bridge which he had built and  
which still exists today. It was then reported to him that the Jews of Prague are in the  
habit of spitting whenever they pass next to the crucifix. Being a famous protector of  
the Jews, he did not institute persecution against them, but simply [[sentenced]] the  
Jewish community to pay for the Hebrew word Adonay (Lord) to be inscribed on the  
crucifix in [[gold]]en letters. This word is one of the seven holiest names of God, and no  
mark of disrespect is allowed in front of it. The spitting ceased. Other incidents  
connected with the same custom were much less amusing.

66 The verses most commonly used for this purpose contain words derived from the  
Hebrew root shaqetz which means 'abominate, detest', as in Deuteronomy, 7:26:  
'thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.' It  
seems that the insulting term sheqetz, used to refer to all Gentiles (Chapter 2),  
originated from this custom.

67 Talmud, Tractate Beytzah, p. 21a, b; Mishnah Berurah on Shulhan 'Arukh, 'Orah  
Hayyim' 512. Another commentary (Magen Avraham) also excludes Karaites.

68 According to the Halakha, a Gentile slave bought by a Jew should be converted to  
Judaism, but does not thereby become a proper Jew.

69 Leviticus, 25:46.

70 The Hebrew form of the name Jesus - Yeshu - was interpreted as an acronym for  
the curse may his name and memory be wiped out', which is used as an extreme form  
of abuse. In fact, anti-zionist Orthodox Jews (such as Neturey Qarta) sometimes refer  
to Herzl as 'Herzl Jesus' and I have found in religious zionist writings expressions  
such as 'Nasser Jesus' and more recently 'Arafat Jesus.'
