[[Donald]] [[Trump]] shocked countries around the world when he won the election for 
[[President]] of the [[United]] [[States]] of [[America]] ([[USA]]) on [[November]] 8, [[2016]]. [[Trump]] was 
formally elected as the 58th US [[President]], together with Mike Pence as his 
Vice-[[President]], by the Electoral College on [[December]] 19, [[2016]]. However, the 
official inauguration ceremony did not take place until [[January]] 20, [[2017]]. While 
most of us were in a state of shock during the weeks between [[Trump]]'s election 
and his inauguration; millions of [[America]]ns immediately took to the streets in 
nationwide [[[[protest]]s]] under the collective chant “Not my [[President]]!”.
 
[[Trump]]’s presidential welcome (or lack thereof) did not get any better at his 
inauguration. In fact, attendance at [[Trump]]’s formal inauguration ceremony was 
one of the lowest in modern [[history]] – the crowds were only a fraction of the 
size that attended former [[President]] [[Obama]]’s inauguration. Not only has the open 
wound of [[Trump]]’s election failed to heal, but [[Trump]]’s toxic team has infected 
the White House with such high levels of corruption and lies that no one knows 
who to trust anymore.

in NYC)
 
Since taking office, [[Trump]] has tried to fulfill his campaign promises of 
enacting a Muslim travel ban; erecting a wall between the [[USA]] and [[Mexico]]; 
deporting undocumented immigrants, and nominating conservative judges to the 
Supreme Court with mixed results. While his Supreme Court appointment, Brett 
Cavanaugh went through despite multiple sexual assault allegations - it may go 
down as one of, if not the, most controversial appointments in US [[history]]. 
[[Trump]]'s travel bans were overturned by the courts and his wall will likely never
be built.
 
At the same time, he has engaged in an anti-media campaign to discredit any 
media outlet critical of his Presidency as “fake news”. His obsession with fake 
news is more of a reflection of his own lies and those of his reported [[Russia]]n 
hacker friends, than any media-wide conspiracy to lie to the [[America]]n people 
about the [[President]].
 
He has also used social media to call out his perceived political enemies, 
name-call anyone who doesn’t agree with him and taunt world leaders. While his 
national security team has no doubt worked overtime to prevent World [[War]] III; 
[[Trump]]’s presidency has the added stress of one political scandal after another. 
From his reported relationship and subsequent pay-off to porn star Stormy 
Daniels; to his alleged collusion/collaboration with [[Russia]]; and the guilty 
pleas of former [[Trump]] aides to various criminal offences; [[Trump]] has no doubt set
the record for the most tumultuous first 18 months in office.
 
Unlike our ability to change the channel when [[Trump]]’s former reality show "The 
Apprentice" would invade our TV screens, the very real “live reality” show of 
[[Trump]]’s presidency is the only channel available to [[America]]ns right now. While 
[[Trump]]’s crazy hair, weird hand gestures and remarkably bizarre and often 
incoherent rants might provide endless fodder for late night comedy shows; this 
[[President]]’s junior high school style diplomacy does more than just reflect 
poorly on [[Trump]] as an individual. The Office of the [[President]] is an institution 
that is supposed to represent the [[America]]n people, but currently appears to only
represent [[Donald]] [[Trump]]'s every whim or vendetta in an embarrassing Twitter 
drama.
 
The now infamous anonymous op-ed allegedly written by an insider has described 
[[Trump]] as “impetuous, adversarial, petty and ineffective”. Excerpts from 
award-winning journalist, Bob Woodward’s new book: Fear: [[Trump]] in the White 
House, together with insights gleaned from other journalists with access to the 
White House, like Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury: Inside the [[Trump]] White House 
expose the current turmoil within the White House. Taken together with [[Trump]]’s 
own public behavior and the insights gleaned from former senior officials, we 
all have cause to be worried; and when I say “we”, I mean [[America]]ns, [[Canadian]]s 
and [[Indigenous]] Nations all over Turtle Island.

It’s not much of a stretch to assume that a White House in this much turmoil, 
being led by someone who thrives on conflict and chooses to align himself with 
autocrats and dictators over [[America]]'s long-held allies; presents a clear a 
present danger for national security at a global level, but also public safety 
at the local level. [[Canada]] is [[America]]’s closest ally – politically and 
geographically. Any form of major or sustained attack on the [[USA]], risks the 
safety of [[Canadian]]s working in the US or inter-married with [[America]]ns.
 
Similarly, those [[Canadian]]s living in border towns may suffer the consequences of
attacks made in close proximity. As a known ally of the US, retaliatory attacks 
on the US might also be accompanied by direct attacks on [[Canada]]. It matters very
much to our safety and security to know what is happening in the south. So, 
while [[Canadian]]s, like many [[America]]ns, would also like to turn the channel when 
[[Trump]] appears on our news stations – our collective worry prevents us from doing
so. It is far worse for sovereign [[Indigenous]] Nations who pay the price for 
decisions made without us.

It's no coincidence that [[Canada]] has been sucked into the [[trade]] dispute between 
the US and [[China]]. Recently, several [[Canadian]]s were detained by the [[Chinese]] 
[[government]], reportedly as a bargaining chip to force [[Canada]] to release an 
Executive from Huawei being held for extradition to the US. While [[Canada]] is not 
a party the US-[[China]] [[trade]] dispute, [[Canadian]]s are collateral damage on [[Trump]]'s 
toxic, combative presidency.
 
It is important to note, that these observations from the northern part of 
Turtle Island are not related to the divide between liberal and conservative 
ideologies or Republican and Democrat politics. These concerns are not about 
[[NAFTA]], the [[trade]] tariffs [[Trump]] imposed on [[Canada]] or the fact that [[Trump]] called 
our Prime Minister “very dishonest and meek”. No, these concerns represent the 
very real concerns of [[Canadian]]s and First Nations, who, like many [[America]]ns and 
[[Native]] [[America]]n tribal [[government]]s, value the advances made in our societies in 
relation to [[Indigenous]] [[sovereignty]] and rights, civil rights, human rights and 
freedoms, and the push to address social injustices like [[racism]], [[poverty]] and 
[[homeless]]ness. It is also safe to say that the recent [[United]] Nations Report on 
Climate Change has [[Indigenous]] Nations all over Turtle Island deeply concerned 
about the [[health]] and well-being our lands, waters and future generations if 
“leaders” like [[Trump]] remain in power.
 
[[Trump]] may be able to brag about the [[America]]n economy and the low unemployment 
rates, but this does little to quell the [[violence]] which stems from [[white]] 
supremacy and racists emboldened by [[Trump]]’s perceived alignment with these 
groups. His outright refusal to condemn Naziism and his claim there are good 
people within the [[white]] supremacist movement has made it even more difficult to 
keep the lid closed on Pandora’s box of hatred. Under the guise of “making 
[[America]] great again” the worst segments of society have come forth in more 
public ways to spread their hatred against racialized peoples under the guise 
free speech and diversity of thought. And why should northern Turtle Island be 
concerned? Because [[white]] supremacy, hatred and race-based [[violence]] is an 
infection that spreads when you give it oxygen. And given that Turtle Island is 
divided by an artificial border, there is little stop this rise in [[white]] 
supremacy from expanding its lethal infection north in [[Canada]].

And it is spreading north. Steve Bannon, [[Trump]]’s former strategist, whose 
far-right ideologies are praised by Neo-Nazis and the KKK, was invited to speak 
about populism at the Munk debate. However, while hatred is spreading, that 
doesn't mean it is new to [[Canada]]. One need only look at [[Canada]]'s lethal 
genocidal policies against [[Indigenous]] peoples and it ongoing [[racism]], [[violence]] 
and destruction of native lands to know - [[racism]] and [[white]] supremacy is alive 
and well in [[Canada]]. It is the recent rise in populism, fueled by [[Trump]], that has
encouraged it to spread to new generations in [[Canada]] in more public ways. The 
reported anti-black and anti-[[Indigenous]] actions of [[Ontario]] [[Premier]] Doug Ford, 
and the hateful, anti-immigrant rants of Maxime Bernier are just the tip of the 
iceberg.
 
Formerly hidden or subversive hate groups in [[Canada]] and the US have been given 
very powerful signals from exceptionally powerful men (usually right-wing, 
ultra-conservative) that the coast is clear to more actively spread hatred. So, 
[[Trump]]’s impact on [[Canada]] presents a very real and present danger to [[Indigenous]] 
Nations and racialized [[Canadian]]s.
 
So the question is: are [[America]]ns (and [[Canadian]]s) truly condemned to two more 
years of [[Trump]]’s “Crazy town” or are there realistic alternatives? Early in his 
presidency, some political commentators offered their analyses on the chances of
[[Trump]] being impeached. More recently, commentators and politicians alike have 
suggested the possibility of declaring him unfit under the 25th amendment. While
some worry that this may cause a constitutional crisis, others like 
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth [[War]]ren – embroiled in her own controversy of 
[[white]] appropriation of [[Indigenous]] identity - feels that the US may already be in
a constitutional crisis if Cabinet feels [[Trump]] can’t do the job.
 
What most political analysts do agree on is that there is a very remote chance 
that [[Trump]] will ever be removed from office. Could this be why there is 
reportedly a core group within the White House trying to protect country? Could 
this be why senior White House officials are taking huge personal risks to 
expose the potential danger within and protect the [[America]]n people? While it is 
hard to know anyone’s personal motivations, it would be incredible to think that
someone is watching out for the people.
 
Some believe that a true patriot – a real [[America]]n – is one who votes and that 
true loyalty to the [[America]]n flag and constitution means standing by your 
[[President]] no matter what. Sure there is some buyer’s remorse amongst some who 
voted for [[Trump]], and some feelings of regret by those who didn’t vote at all 
having assumed that there was no way [[Trump]] could be elected. But what about the 
collective fear and worry by [[America]]ns and [[Native]] [[America]]ns – regardless of 
their voter status or their political leanings – about the very real and dark 
turn of events since [[Trump]]’s election? What of the confirmed [[Russia]]n 
interference with the election, the risks of retaliation from other countries 
against [[Trump]]’s aggressive tactics, the thousands of [[child]]ren traumatized when 
they were separated from their migrant families, destruction of native lands, 
[[murdered]] and [[missing]] [[Native]] [[America]]n women, or the very obvious rise in racist, 
[[white]] supremacist banter?
 
How does [[America]]n loyalty to the institution of the Presidency jive with their 
loyalty to equality, democracy, freedom of the press, human rights, the right to
life and their own constitution?
 
If this is the difficult issue facing [[America]]ns right now, imagine how those 
working in the White House feel? Worse, imagine how [[Native]] [[America]]ns feel that 
this is all taking place on their sovereign territories? While it may be easy to
condemn the unnamed officials who are trying to keep the White House stable 
despite the [[Trump]] circus, what real choice do they have if they are committed to
“the people” – which is supposed to be the real [[government]] anyway?
 
It may not follow the rules of democracy or the processes laid out in policies, 
but how long can good people use process, protocol or past practice as an excuse
not to act? In his address to before the [[Canadian]] Parliament in [[1961]], [[America]]’s 
35th [[President]] John F [[Kennedy]] said; “The only thing necessary for the triumph of
evil is for good men to do nothing”. I am sure many [[America]]ns are hoping that 
more good people come forward and take concrete actions to protect the US and 
[[Canada]] both from the risks posed by [[Trump]]’s "Crazy town".
 
In the meantime, my money is on “the people” – the people who have risen up and 
taken a stand against this infection of hatred - those who shoulder the unfair 
burden of making sure it doesn’t turn into a plague. Our sovereign [[Indigenous]] 
Nations have something to say about the threat to public safety and national 
security in our territories. Our [[treaty]] partners have not only breached our 
[[treaties]], but their self-interested, hateful actions pose real dangers to our 
peoples and our [[Canadian]] and [[America]]n allies. The fight for our future is real. 
We better make [[2019]] the year of the [[revolution]] and Make [[America]] (and [[Canada]]) 
[[Native]] Again.
