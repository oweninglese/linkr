C-92 An Act Respecting First Nations, Inuit and Métis Children, Youth and 
Families
 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT has once again proven that legislative initiatives tend 
to be effective deflections from their ongoing failures to address human rights 
abuses against [[Indigenous]] peoples. Bill C-92: An Act Respecting First Nations, 
Inuit and Métis Children, Youth and Families ([[2019]]) was heralded by the Assembly
of First Nations (AFN) and the federal [[government]] as the solution to the 
“humanitarian crisis” of First Nations [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care. The AFN in 
particular pushed hard for the legislation to pass in Parliament, despite 
widespread opposition and [[[[protest]]s]] from First Nations from all over [[Canada]]. 
First Nations legal and [[child]] [[welfare]] experts also warned Parliament that C-92 
did not align with [[Canada]]’s political promises and could in fact make things 
worse. They were right.
 
NO STATUTORY GUARANTEE OF FUNDING
 
There are many substantive problems with C-92, but the most obvious is that 
there is no statutory guarantee of funding for First Nations in the legislation.
In other words, there is no judicial right that a First Nation could use in 
court to force federal compliance in relation to funding under the Act. This 
concern was raised and effectively ignored by the AFN in its push to have the 
bill pass into law — all while federal officials were assuring First Nations 
that funding would follow. As expected, funding did not follow and to make 
matters worse, it looks like the federal [[government]] used C-92 as an attempt to 
insulate itself from the orders of the [[Canadian]] Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT).
 
The federal [[government]] has confirmed that it does not consider itself to be 
bound by CHRT orders to end racial discrimination in funding against First 
Nations [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care, once First Nations assume jurisdiction under 
C-92.
 
“Since (Bill C-92) falls outside the scope of the CHRT orders, the CHRT orders 
will not apply to a First Nation that has assumed jurisdiction.”
 
Federal officials further clarified that:
 
“There is no funding stream for the long-term operationalization of an 
[[Indigenous]] governing body’s law once they begin exercising jurisdiction.”
 
This confirmation comes from the federal [[government]]’s response to questions 
posed by the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society in their ongoing 
litigation at the CHRT. [[Canada]] is effectively telling First Nations: Sure, you 
can assume jurisdiction over housing, education, [[health]] care and [[child]] and 
family services; but if you do, your funding will be cut or reduced. Oh, and by 
the way, you assume all the liability.

The whole point of the CHRT’s original decision was for [[Canada]] to stop racially 
discriminating against First Nations [[child]]ren in [[foster]] care and their families.
One of the primary reasons why First Nations [[child]]ren are apprehended and placed
in [[foster]] care at such high rates is due to the purposeful, chronic and racially
discriminatory underfunding of essential social services for First Nations — 
like [[child]] and family services. Ironically, one of the most striking pieces of 
evidence in the CHRT hearing came from the [[government]]’s own internal documents 
that confirmed that federal underfunding leads to higher rates of First Nation 
[[child]] apprehensions. Yet [[Canada]] continues to underfund [[child]] and family services
and all services like housing, [[health]] care, education, water and [[mental]] [[health]] 
services like suicide prevention on reserve. It is no coincidence then, that 
First Nations have the worst socioeconomic conditions of all groups in [[Canada]].

TRANSFER OF FEDERAL LIABILITY
 
This follows a similar pattern in federal legislative initiatives over the last 
few decades, where under the guise of addressing a breach of [[Indigenous]] rights, 
they instead use legislation to deflect from the matter and find ways to 
insulate itself from liability and/or transfer federal liability to First 
Nations. Bill C-3: Gender Equity in [[Indian]] Registration ([[2011]]) was supposed to 
end sex discrimination against First Nations women and their descendants in 
[[Indian]] registration. Instead it created new discrimination and in s. 9 insulated
itself from any legal claims by those [[Canada]] had discriminated against for 
decades. Similarly, in Bill S-3: An Act to amend the [[Indian]] Act in response to 
the Superior Court of [[Quebec]] decision in Descheneaux c. [[Canada]] (Procureur 
general) ([[2017]]), [[Canada]] once again failed to address all forms of sex 
discrimination and via s. 10 purports to insulate itself from liability for the 
discrimination endured by First Nations women and their descendants.

In enacting legislation, even in relation to First Nations, the federal 
[[government]] should always be assumed to be acting in the best interests of the 
[[Crown]] first, despite its fiduciary and other legal obligations to First Nations.
C-3 and S-3 are just two legislative examples of explicit insulation of 
liability from [[Canada]]’s own wrongdoing. Another example is the Safe Drinking 
Water for First Nations Act ([[2013]]), which has done little to remedy ongoing the 
lack of clean drinking water and sanitation on all First Nation reserves but 
helped deflect media attention away from the crisis. Yet the legislation creates
more problems than it solves including the creation of new ways to im[[prison]] 
First Nations members who breach the water laws; ensure federal laws are 
paramount over First Nation laws; and the inclusion of s. 11 which purports to 
limit liability for both the provincial and federal [[government]]s.
 
"DRAW DOWN" JURISDICTION?
 
In this context, it becomes apparent that First Nations who “draw down” 
jurisdiction under C-92 may be assuming significant financial and legal 
liability without corresponding legal protections and guaranteed, long-term 
needs and rights-based financial supports. Take a scenario where a First Nation 
band member is receiving federal support for [[health]] needs for their [[child]]ren 
under Jordan’s Principle and then the band assumes jurisdiction. What happens to
the funding support for this First Nation band member and their [[child]]ren if — as
the federal [[government]] has confirmed — they will not be bound by CHRT orders to 
provide funding to First Nations for critical programs like Jordan’s Principle 
(a [[child]]-first policy that is meant to ensure First Nations [[child]]ren have access
to the same [[government]] services that other [[child]]ren do)? Does the member seek 
funding from the First Nation and if so, how will the First Nation provide this 
funding if the federal [[government]] ends Jordan’s Principle funding to First 
Nations under C-92?
 
The AFN has a lot to answer for in its support of C-92 without ensuring the 
free, prior and informed consent of First Nations, and worse, for forging ahead 
when so many First Nations leaders and First Nation [[child]] [[welfare]] experts were 
against the legislation as it read. First Nations who have given notice or are 
contemplating giving notice that they want to “draw down” jurisdiction over 
[[child]] and family services under C-92 are likely shocked to hear these concerning
revelations by the federal [[government]]. This is not something the [[government]] 
shared during review of the bill or has included in their information packages 
online.

"TRUST US" MANTRA IS NOT ENOUGH
 
Were it not for the ongoing legal actions by the First Nations Child and Family 
Caring Society to hold the federal [[government]] to account to comply with CHRT 
orders, we might not know the gravity of the funding situation. [[Canada]] must now 
answer for this bad faith funding shell game to undermine the basic human rights
of First Nations [[child]]ren. The “trust us” mantra is not enough when the issue is
the ongoing genocide of First Nations. It is long past time for full 
transparency and to stop ducking its human rights obligations to First Nations 
[[child]]ren and families.
