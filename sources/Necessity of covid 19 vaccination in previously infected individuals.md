## Summary: 
Cumulative incidence of [[COVID-19]] was examined among 52238 employees in an [[America]] [[healthcare]] system. [[COVID-19]] did not occur in anyone over the five months of the study among 2579
individuals previously infected with COVID-19, including 1359 who did not take the vaccine.

## ABSTRACT
### Background. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination in persons previously infected with [[SARS-CoV-2]].
#### Methods. 
Employees of the [[Cleveland]] Clinic Health System working in Ohio on Dec 16, [[2020]], the
day #COVID-19 [[vaccination]] was started, were included. Any subject who tested positive for [[SARS-CoV-2]]
at least 42 days earlier was considered previously [[infected]]. One was considered [[vaccinated]] 14 days after
receipt of the second dose of a #SARS-CoV-2 [[mRNA]] [[vaccine]]. The cumulative incidence of [[SARS-CoV-2]]
#infection over the next five months, among previously #infected subjects who received the #vaccine, was
compared with those of previously #infected subjects who remained #unvaccinated, previously uninfected
subjects who received the [[vaccine]], and previously #uninfected subjects who remained #unvaccinated.
Results. Among the 52238 included employees, 1359 (53%) of 2579 previously infected subjects
remained unvaccinated, compared with 22777 (41%) of 49659 not previously infected. The cumulative
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection remained almost zero among previously infected unvaccinated
subjects, previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and previously uninfected subjects who were
vaccinated, compared with a steady increase in cumulative incidence among previously uninfected
subjects who remained unvaccinated. Not one of the 1359 previously infected subjects who remained
unvaccinated had a SARS-CoV-2 infection over the duration of the study. In a Cox proportional hazards
regression model, after adjusting for the phase of the epidemic, vaccination was associated with a
significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not previously infected (HR 0.031, 95%
CI 0.015 to 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR 0.313, 95% CI 0 to Infinity).
Conclusions. Individuals who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection are unlikely to benefit from COVID-
vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who have not been infected before.

## INTRODUCTION

#### header
The two [[FDA]]-approved ([[BNT162b2]] [[mRNA]] [Pfizer-BioNTech] and [[mRNA-1273]] [Moderna])
#mRNA vaccines have been shown to be very efficacious in protecting against [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] ([[SARS]]) – associated [[Coronavirus-2]] ([[SARS-CoV-2]]) infection [1,2]. The effectiveness of the
[[Pfizer-BioNTech]] vaccine in a real-world setting has also been shown to be comparable to the efficacy
demonstrated in clinical trials [3,4]. Given these, there has been an understandable desire to vaccinate as
many people as possible.
The ability to #vaccinate a large part of the population is limited by the supply of #vaccine. As of
March 21, [[2021]], 78% of 447 million doses of the [[coronavirus]] disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines that
had been deployed had gone to only ten countries [5]. The [[COVAX]] initiative was borne out of the
recognition that equitable distribution of #vaccines worldwide was essential for effective control of the
#COVID-19 #pandemic. However, the reality is that there is great disparity in the availability of vaccines
across countries. Countries with limited supplies of vaccine have to prioritize how their supply of
vaccines will be allocated within their populations. Criteria used for such prioritization have included
profession, age, and comorbid conditions. Data that inform prioritization criteria with help maximize the
benefits of whatever vaccine is available.
Observational studies have found very low rates of reinfection among individuals with prior
#SARS-CoV-2 infection [6–8]. This brings up the question about whether it is necessary to vaccinate
previously infected individuals. These studies notwithstanding, there remains a theoretical possibility that
the vaccine may still provide some benefit in previously infected persons. A prior large observational
study concluded that immunity from natural infection cannot be relied on to provide adequate protection
and advocated for vaccination of previously infected individuals [9]. The #CDC website recommends that
persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 still get the vaccine [10]. Despite these recommendations,
credible reports of previously infected persons getting #COVID-19 are rare. The rationale often provided
for getting the #COVID-19 vaccine is that it is safer to get vaccinated than to get the disease. This is
certainly true, but it is not an explanation for why people who have already had the #disease need to be
#vaccinated. A strong case for vaccinating previously #infected persons can be made if it can be shown that
previously infected persons who are #vaccinated have a lower incidence of #COVID-19 than previously
infected persons who did not receive the vaccine.
The purpose of this study was to attempt to do just that, and thereby evaluate the necessity of the
#COVID-19 vaccine in persons who were previously infected with #SARS-CoV-2.

## METHODS

#### Study design
This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio,
USA. The study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board. A waiver of informed
consent and waiver of HIPAA authorization were approved to allow access to personal health information
by the research team, with the understanding that sharing or releasing identifiable data to anyone other
than the study team was not permitted without additional IRB approval.
#### Setting
#PCR testing for #SARS-CoV-2 at #Cleveland Clinic began on March 12, #2020/, and a streamlined
process dedicated to the testing of health care personnel (HCP) was begun shortly thereafter. All
employees with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test were interviewed by Occupational Health, with date of onset
of symptoms of COVID-19 being one of the questions asked. Vaccination for COVID-19 began at
Cleveland Clinic on [[December 16]], [[2020]]. When initially started it was the #Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine that
was administered, until the #Moderna vaccine became available, from which time employees received one
or the other. All employees were scheduled to receive their second vaccine dose 28 days after the first
one, regardless of which vaccine was given. The employee cohort was chosen for this study because of
documentation of their COVID-19 vaccination and of any SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Occupational
Health database.
#### Participants
All employees of the #Cleveland Clinic Health System, working in #Ohio, on Dec 16, [[2020]], were
screened for inclusion in the study. Those who were in employment on December 16, #2020, were
included.
#### Variables
#SARS-CoV-2 infection was defined as a positive nucleic acid amplification test. The date of
infection was taken to be the date of onset of symptoms when available, and the date of #specimen
collection when not. A person was considered #vaccinated 14 days after receipt of the second dose of the
#vaccine (which would have been 42 days after receipt of the first dose of the vaccine for most subjects).
For the sake of consistency in the duration assumed for development of natural and vaccine immunity,
any person who tested positive for #SARS-CoV-2 at least 42 days before the vaccine rollout date, was
considered previously infected. Other #covariates collected were #age, #job #location, job type (patient-facing
or non-patient facing), and job category. The job location variable could be one of the following:
#Cleveland Clinic Main Campus, regional hospital (within #Ohio), ambulatory center, administrative center,
or remote location. The job category was one of the following: professional staff, residents/fellows,
advance practice practitioners, nursing, pharmacy, clinical support, research, administration, and
administration support.
#### Outcome
The study outcome was time to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the latter defined as a [[positive nucleic
acid amplification test]] for SARS-CoV-2 on or after December 16, 2020. Time to SARS-CoV-2 infection
was calculated as number of days from December 16, 2020 (vaccine rollout date) to SARS-CoV-
infection. Employees that had not developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection were censored at the end of the
study follow-up period (May 15, 2021). Those who received the [[Johnson & Johnson]] vaccine (81 subjects)
without having had a SARS-CoV-2 infection were censored on the day of receipt of the vaccine, and
those whose employment was terminated during the study period before they had SARS-CoV-2 infection
(2245 subjects) were censored on the date of termination of employment. The health system never had a
requirement for asymptomatic employee test screening. Most of the positive tests, therefore, would have
been tests done to evaluate suspicious symptoms. A small proportion would have been tests done as part
of pre-operative or pre-procedural screening.
#### Statistical analysis
A #Simon-Makuch [[hazard plot]] [11] was created to compare the cumulative incidence of SARS-
CoV-2 infection among previously infected subjects who were #vaccinated, with those of previously
#infected subjects who remained #unvaccinated, previously #uninfected subjects who were vaccinated, and
previously #uninfected subjects who remained #unvaccinated. Previous infection was treated as a time-
independent covariate (SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 42 days before Dec 16, 2020), and vaccination (
days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine) was treated as a time-dependent covariate (Figure 1).
Curves for the unvaccinated were based on data for those who did not receive the vaccine over the
duration of the study, and for those who did until the date they were considered vaccinated, from which
point onwards their data were recorded into the corresponding vaccinated set. A #Cox proportional hazards
regression model was fitted with time to #SARS-CoV-2 infection as the outcome variable against
#vaccination (as a time-dependent covariate whose value changed on the date a subject was considered
#vaccinated)[12]. Previous #infection (as a time-independent covariate) and an interaction term for previous
[[infection]] and [[vaccination]] were included as [[covariates]]. The phase of the epidemic was adjusted for by
including the slope of the [[epidemic]] curve as a time-dependent #covariate whose value changed
continuously with the slope of the epidemic curve. The analysis was performed by #NKS and #ASN using
the survival package and R version 4.0.5 [12–14].
## RESULTS

#### Of 52238 employees included in the study, 2579 (5%) were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2.
#### Baseline characteristics
Those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 were significantly younger (mean ± SD age; 39 ±
13 vs. 42 ± 13, p<0.001), and included a significantly higher proportion with patient-facing jobs (65% vs.
51%, p<0.001). Table 1 shows the characteristics of subjects grouped by whether or not they were
previously infected. A significantly lower proportion of those previously infected (47%, 1220 subjects)
were vaccinated by the end of the study compared to 59% (29461) of those not previously infected
(p<0.001). Of those vaccinated, 63% received the Moderna vaccine. Twelve percent of subjects with
previous SARS-CoV-2 infection did not have a symptom onset date, suggesting they may possibly have
been identified on pre-operative or pre-procedural screening, and may not have had symptomatic
infection. When vaccination was begun, the epidemic in #Ohio was at the peak of its third wave (Figure 2).
#### Cumulative incidence of COVID-
Figure 3 is a [[Simon-Makuch plot ]]showing that SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred almost
exclusively in subjects who were not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and who remained
unvaccinated. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among previously infected
unvaccinated subjects did not differ from that of previously infected subjects who were vaccinated, and
that of previously uninfected subjects who were vaccinated. For all three of these groups, the cumulative
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was much lower than that of subjects who were not previously
infected and who remained unvaccinated. Of the 2154 SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study period,
2139 (99.3%) occurred among those not previously infected who remained unvaccinated or were waiting
to get vaccinated, and15 (0.7%) occurred among those not previously infected who were vaccinated. Not
one of the 2579 previously infected subjects had a SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 1359 who remained
unvaccinated throughout the duration of the study.
#### Association of vaccination with occurrence of COVID
In a Cox proportional hazards regression model, after adjusting for the phase of the epidemic,
vaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among those not
previously infected (HR 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 – 0.061) but not among those previously infected (HR
0.313, 95% CI 0 – Infinity). The absence of events among those who were previously infected, whether
they received the vaccine or not, precluded accurate or precise estimates for the latter effect size.
#### Duration of protection
This study was not specifically designed to determine the duration of protection afforded by
natural infection, but for the previously infected subjects the median duration since prior infection was
143 days (IQR 76 – 179 days), and no one had SARS-CoV-2 infection over the following five months,
suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection may provide protection against reinfection for 10 months or
longer.
## DISCUSSION

#### This study shows that subjects previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to get COVID-19 reinfection whether or not they receive the vaccine. 
This finding calls into question the necessity to
vaccinate those who have already had SARS-CoV-2 infection.
It is reasonable to expect that immunity acquired by natural infection provides effective
protection against future infection with SARS-CoV-2. Observational studies have indeed found very low
rates of reinfection over the following months among survivors of COVID-19 [6–8]. Reports of true
reinfections are extremely rare in the absence of emergence of new variants. When such reinfections
occur, it would be purely speculative to suggest that a vaccine might have prevented them. Duration of
protective immunity from natural infection is not known. However, the same also can be said about
duration of protective immunity from vaccination. Uncertainty about the duration of protective immunity
afforded by natural infection is not by itself a valid argument for vaccinating previously infected
individuals. This study provides direct evidence that vaccination with the best available vaccines does not
provide additional protection in previously infected individuals.
A prior study concluded that natural infection cannot be relied on to protect against COVID-
[9]. That study was based on comparison of PCR-positivity rates during a second COVID-19 surge in
Denmark between those who tested positive and negative during the first COVID-19 surge, and indirectly
calculated that prior infection provided 80.5% protection against repeat infection, and that protection
against those older than 65 years was only 47.1%. The study did not compare vaccinated and
unvaccinated people, and it is therefore an assumption to consider that a vaccine would have provided
better protection in that particular population. Furthermore, there was a gap of only seven weeks between
the end of the first surge and the beginning of the second in that study. It is now well-known that a small
number of people can continue to have positive PCR test results for several weeks to a few months after
infection, one study finding that 5.3% remained positive at 90 days [15]. It is possible that some of the
positives picked up in the early part of the second surge were not necessarily new infections but residual
virus from the tail end of the first surge. Since the actual number of infections was small, a few such
misclassifications could change the rates substantially. Our study examined rates of SARS-CoV-
infection in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals and showed that those previously infected who did
not receive the vaccine did not have higher rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection than those previously infected
who did, thereby providing direct evidence that vaccination does not add protection to those who were
previously infected.
There are several strengths to our study. Its large sample size and follow-up of up to 5 months
provide us with an ample degree of confidence in its findings. A major strength of our study is that we
adjusted the analyses for the phase of the epidemic at all time points. The risk of acquisition of infection
is strongly influenced by the phase of the epidemic at any given time, and it is important to adjust for this
for accurate risk analyses. Given that was this a study among employees of a health system, and that the
health system had policies and procedures in recognition of the critical importance of keeping track of the
pandemic among its employees, we had an accurate accounting of who had COVID-19, when they were
diagnosed with COVID-19, who received a COVID-19 vaccine, and when they received it.
The study has its limitations. Because we did not have a policy of asymptomatic employee
screening, previously infected subjects who remained asymptomatic might have been misclassified as
previously uninfected. Given this limitation, one should be cautious about drawing conclusions about the
protective effect of prior asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. It should be noted though, that 12% of
the subjects classified as previously infected did not have a symptom onset date recorded, suggesting that
at least some of those classified as previously infected might have been asymptomatic infections. It is
reassuring that none of these possibly asymptomatically infected individuals developed COVID-19 during
the duration of the study. The study follow-up duration was short, being only five months, but this was
longer than published mRNA vaccine efficacy studies [1,2], and longer than the follow-up duration of the
largest published vaccine effectiveness studies to date [3,4]. Median freedom from reinfection (time from
initial infection until end of follow-up) in this study, for those previously infected, of almost 10 months, is
consistent with findings in an earlier study that immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the spike protein remained
stable over more than six months after an episode of infection [16]. Our study included no children and
few elderly subjects, and the majority would not have been immunosuppressed. Data governance policies
in our institution precluded us from obtaining detailed clinical information on employees. While one
cannot generalize this study’s findings to assume that prior infection would provide adequate immunity in
these groups, there is also no reason to expect a vaccine to provide additional protection in these same
groups. Lastly, it is necessary to emphasize that these findings are based on the prevailing assortment of
virus variants in the community during the study. It is not known how well these results will hold if or
when some of the newer variants of concern become prominent. However, if prior infection does not
afford protection against some of the newer variants of concern, there is little reason to suppose that the
currently available vaccines would either. Vaccine breakthrough infections with variants have indeed
been reported [17].
Our study’s findings have important implications. Worldwide, COVID-19 vaccines are still in
short supply. As of March 9, 2021, dozens of countries had not been able to administer a single dose of
the vaccine [18]. As of May 17, 2021, only 17 countries had been able to reach ten percent or more of
their populations with at least the first dose of vaccine [19]. Given such a scarcity of the vaccine, and the
knowledge that vaccine does not provide additional protection to those previously infected, it would make
most sense to limit vaccine administration to those who have not previously had the infection. In addition
to profession, age, and comorbid conditions, previous infection should be an important consideration in
deciding whom to prioritize to receive the vaccine. A practical and useful message would be to consider
symptomatic COVID-19 to be as good as having received a vaccine, and that people who have had
COVID-19 confirmed by a reliable laboratory test do not need the vaccine.
In conclusion, individuals who have laboratory-confirmed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection
are unlikely to benefit from COVID-19 vaccination, and vaccines can be safely prioritized to those who
have not been infected before.
