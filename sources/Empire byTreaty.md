Empire by Treaty?
The role of written documents in European overseas
expansion, 1500-1800
Martine van Ittersum
Abstract
Treaty-making was integral to European imperialism and colonialism
in the early modern period. Europeans did not seek to enter into equal
treaties with indigenous rulers or peoples, but to conclude agreements that
advanced their own claims to trade and/or territory. Two case studies – the
Banda Islands and the Hudson Valley in the seventeenth century – serve
to illustrate this point. Of course, the extent to which Europeans achieved
their aims depended on local power constellations in Africa, Asia or the
Americas, and the diplomatic fallout back in Europe. Still, in a world of
endemic violence, treaty and alliance making were essential preparations
for the next round of warfare and, thus, empire-building.

In August 1999, nine members of Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM) entered
the grounds of the Dutch embassy in Jakarta, demanding that the Kingdom
of the Netherlands support Aceh’s independence at the UN and retract its
1873 declaration of war against the Sultanate of Aceh. As the GAM members
were well aware, the Sultanate had been incorporated into the Dutch East
Indies in 1904, after a decades-long guerrilla war in the jungle of Sumatra.
A retraction of the 1873 declaration of war would, GAM members imagined,
be the first step in restoring Acehnese sovereignty and independence. Yet
it was not so easy to turn back the clock. In 1948, the Dutch government
had recognised the Republic of Indonesia as the sole successor state to
the Dutch East Indies. Since then, it has carefully refrained from offering

any kind of support for independence movements active in Sumatra, the
Spice Islands and Timor. In the end, Indonesian police removed the GAM
protesters from the embassy compound after three days, but, at the Dutch
government’s request, did not place them under arrest.1
What makes these protests especially interesting is that GAM justified its
actions with reference to modern international law, particularly the role played
by written documents in orchestrating transfers of sovereignty. This was not
an isolated episode, rather it forms part of a broader interest by indigenous
groups and their supporters in mobilising the language of earlier treaties and
agreements. One place this can be seen is in the writings of James Tully, who
served on the Canadian Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples from 1991
until 1995. Tully assigns an important role to treaty-making in the process of
reconciliation between the aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples of Canada.
He suggests a return to an idealised past of early modern treaty-making, a
period of time when Europeans and indigenous groups were evenly matched
and treated each other as equals. While recognising the presence of abuses, he
places considerable value on what he considers to be the original intentions
behind treaties from the early modern period, namely to settle differences
between natives and Europeans ‘by means of discussion and consent, without
interfering in the internal government of either society’.2
A similar desire to look again at early modern treaties animates a number
of recent publications by historians who have increasingly entered the
debate about treaty-making past and present. Two important contributions
are Native Claims: Indigenous Law against Empire, 1500-1920 (2012) and
Empire by Treaty: Negotiating European Expansion, 1600-1900 (2015), both
edited by Saliha Belmessous. These volumes raise the important question
whether treaties between Europeans and indigenous populations around the
world can be read as alternatives to conquest and war and, possibly, as the
means by which indigenous peoples have sought to turn the tide of Western
imperialism and colonialism. Belmessous notes in her introduction to Empire

after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which destroyed large swathes of Bandar Aceh, that Dutch
government representatives started to visit the area on a regular basis – primarily to check on
rebuilding activities, to which the Netherlands contributed $100 million. The Dutch government
was not involved in the 2005 peace negotiations between GAM and the Indonesian government,
not officially at least.

by Treaty that treaty-making plays an important role in ‘the resolution of
conflicts over indigenous rights in postcolonial settler societies’. Similarly,
Paul Patton, one of the contributors, argues that the treaty relationship
reflects a desire ‘on all sides’ to legitimise settler sovereignty ‘by reference to
the consent, however belated or hypothetical, of […] indigenous peoples’.3
But is this more positive view justified? Not all the contributors to Empire
by Treaty are as sanguine as Belmessous and Patton appear to be about the
capacity of indigenous groups to negotiate or resist empire via treaties. In
her chapter on territorial conflict and alliance-making in pre-1800 South
America, Tamar Herzog convincingly shows that treaties were ‘instruments
of containment’ aimed at realising ‘to the degree that this was possible – the
subjection of all things indigenous’.4 Similarly, in a review of Empire by Treaty,
Dane Kennedy suggests that the history of treaty-making raises serious
concerns about the legitimacy of settler sovereignty, since ‘indigenous
consent was often coerced’.5
This chapter argues that treaty-making should not be seen as an alternative to conquest and war, but was, in fact, integral to the process of European
possession and indigenous dispossession. Europeans who ventured overseas
in the early modern era did not aim to enter into equal treaties with indigenous rulers or peoples, but to conclude agreements that advanced their own
claims to trade and/or territory. In a world of endemic conflict, treaty- and
alliance-making were essential preparations for the next armed conflict.
If treaties were an instrument of European expansion, their deployment
depended on the nature of the states that opposed them. When Europeans
encountered regional powers like Ming or Qing China and Tokugawa Japan,
their advantages disappeared.6 Significantly, the polities capable of withstanding the onslaught of European company-states such as the English
and Dutch East India Companies were those that possessed sizable armed
forces and bureaucracies of their own or that could successfully play off
European competitors against each other.
But in places where Europeans did not face entrenched powers, the treaty
became a document that was closely linked to expansion. To illustrate
this, I examine two cases studies from opposite ends of the world, Dutch
trade and settlement in the Banda Islands in Asia and in the Hudson Valley

in the Americas.7 Neither area was under the direct rule of the federal
government of the Dutch Republic. Instead, the Dutch States General had
established two corporate bodies with sweeping powers: the Dutch East and
West India Companies (VOC and WIC), founded in 1602 and 1621, respectively.
Both companies operated simultaneously as associations of private merchants
and, in their charter areas, as full-fledged sovereign states. They had no qualms
about initiating armed conflicts with European or native competitors. The
outsourcing of overseas expansion to Dutch and English merchant corporations
explains why imperial powers in northwestern Europe tended to thrive on the
toxic combination of warfare and treaty-making – to the detriment of indigenous
rulers and peoples.8 Looking at these examples reveals the ways in which trade,
treaty-making and the use of armed force were inextricably intertwined.

Treaty-making and armed conflict in the Banda Islands9
Located 2,000 kilometres east of Java, the Banda Islands – a group of seven
small islands, including one volcano, the Gunung Api – are now a forgotten
backwater in the Republic of Indonesia. It used to be very different. For
centuries, the Spice Islands – meaning the Northern Moluccas, Ambon,
and the Banda Islands – were part of an Asian trading network connecting
the island of Java with the Philippines and the South China Sea. Merchants
from ports on Java’s north coast frequented the Banda Islands on a regular
basis, exchanging rice from Java and textiles from the Indian subcontinent
for nutmeg and mace. They brought Islam as well. As elsewhere in Southeast
Asia, state development was slow in the Banda Islands. Confederations of
villages, most prominently ulilima (a group of five villages) and ulisiva (a
group of nine villages), competed with each other. Orangkayas (aristocrats,
generally with wealth from trade) met on the island of Nera in order to
reduce conflict between villages and negotiate trade deals. Although the
7 This is not the first attempt to compare Dutch trade and settlement in Asia and the Americas.
Almost 30 years ago, an article analysing Dutch-native relations in Formosa (now Taiwan) and
the Hudson Valley was published in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. The
authors, Hauptman and Knapp, concluded that the differences outweighed the similarities.

Bandanese successfully played Javanese merchants off against each other,
they had become dependent on the spice trade for their livelihoods. Not
much was left of the islands’ original subsistence economy by the time the
first Europeans arrived in the sixteenth century.10
Nutmeg, mace, and cloves had reached Europe via ports in the Middle
East during the Middle Ages. One of the aims of European expansion into
Asia was to cut out Muslim middlemen and establish direct trade links with
the Spice Islands. The Portuguese were the first to reach the Banda Islands.
However, they were not able to establish a military presence there, in sharp
contrast with the Northern Moluccas and Ambon, where they built and
garrisoned fortresses. Nor did the Portuguese obtain any special privileges in
the Banda Islands, but traded on the same footing as Javanese merchants.11
The situation in the Banda Islands changed dramatically when the VOC
appeared on the scene. A swift Dutch penetration into Southeast Asia
went hand-in-hand with naked aggression against both Portuguese and
indigenous shipping. The voyage of Pieter Willemszoon Verhoef (1573-1609),
the VOC’s so-called Fourth Voyage (1607-1612), was crucial in tipping the
balance of power in the Banda Islands. With an eye to the Twelve Years’
Truce (1609-1621) – then being negotiated between the Dutch Republic and
the King of Spain and Portugal – the VOC directors authorised Verhoef in
April 1608 to create a monopoly of trade in the Spice Islands. He received
orders to sign contracts with ‘all the villages in the Moluccas and Banda’,
and to build fortresses in strategic places, ‘with the consent of the Indians’.
The directors’ logic was impeccable: as they noted in their letter, ‘neither the
King of Spain, nor any of his subjects may visit, or trade in, those places in
Asia or Africa where we have possession or exclusive contracts’. Verhoef did
as he was told. For the first time, the Bandanese had to accept a European
military presence in their country. Dutch fortresses were established on
Nera in 1609, on Pulo Way in 1616, and on Great Banda (also known as
Lonthor) in 1621. Despite this, Banda’s indigenous inhabitants had no intention of surrendering without a fight, and took up arms against the VOC. An
already complex situation was complicated even further by the presence
of merchants and mariners employed by the English East India Company
(EIC), eager to secure their own trading interests.12

By establishing fortresses in Asia during the Twelve Years’ Truce and
signing new, exclusive contracts with local allies, the VOC sought to tighten
up the protection/tribute exchange and strengthen its position as a co-ruler
in these territories. In the directors’ view, the VOC protected indigenous
peoples against the ‘tyranny’ of the King of Spain and Portugal and had to
be rewarded by means of exclusive spice deliveries. The Bandanese saw
things differently, of course. As Adam Clulow notes, the orangkayas ‘had
long been accustomed to finding security by playing off foreign powers’.13
Until Verhoef’s arrival in the archipelago, they had treated the VOC as
simply one more merchant bidding for their produce. If and when the VOC
failed to supply the trade goods they required, such as textiles and rice, they
had been at liberty to sell their nutmeg and mace to somebody else, and
frequently did. Verhoef was determined to change that. His murder in May
1609 suggests that many Bandanese objected to establishing closer ties with
the VOC through a new treaty, and were desperate to avoid the construction
of a Dutch fortress. They may well have suspected that, ultimately, it would
result in a complete loss of indigenous sovereignty.14
Thanks to the presence of William Keeling (1577/8-1620) in the Banda
Islands in spring 1609, followed by visits from other EIC merchants and
commanders, local opponents of the VOC were confident that they could play
off the English against the Dutch and thus regain control of the situation.
The Bandanese suffered from internal divisions, however. According to
Governor-General Laurens Reael (1583-1637), they governed themselves
‘entirely in a democratic fashion (populariter), like a republic’, meaning in
this case a high level of internal disunity. It may explain why they dismissed
Keeling’s suggestion to surrender their sovereignty to the King of England.
Only in April 1616, when VOC commander Jan Dirckszoon Lam (d. 1626)
was about to launch an all-out assault, did inhabitants of Pulo Way enact
a ceremony formally acknowledging James I of England as their protector.
It failed to stop Lam’s conquest of the island. But it did create a very useful
precedent for the EIC. Eight months later, Nathaniel Courthope had little

difficulty persuading inhabitants of Pulu Run – many of whom were refugees
from Pulo Way – to repeat the ceremony and sign a treaty with him.15
Meanwhile, VOC officials continued to sign contracts with the Bandanese
as well, primarily with inhabitants of Rosengain and Great Banda. From
the VOC perspective, the military conquests of Nera and Pulo Way in 1609
and 1616, respectively, had turned local populations into Company subjects.
By concluding treaties with inhabitants of Rosengain and Great Banda in
May 1616, April 1617, and June 1618, both Lam and Reael sought to obtain
native recognition of the changed status of Nera and Pulo Way, secure a
steady supply of nutmeg and mace for the VOC, and completely isolate Pulo
Run and its inhabitants, who had sided with the English. Although Reael
failed to launch a successful invasion of Pulo Run in the spring of 1617 and
1618, he used all the other means at his disposal to make life difficult for
Courthope and his indigenous allies. Citing the contracts already signed
with the Dutch, he forbade any contact between Bandanese allies of the
VOC and inhabitants of Pulo Run, for example. The wavering loyalties of
the Bandanese proved to be the Achilles’ heel of his strategy. In summer
1618, Reael signed a truce treaty with the ‘orangkayas and magistrates’ of
Selamon only, not with any other villages on Great Banda. Those villages
had effectively sided with the inhabitants of Pulo Run.16
From the Dutch perspective, the next logical step was to conquer and
pacify Great Banda. More nutmeg trees grew on Great Banda than on all the
other islands of the archipelago combined. The inhabitants of Pulo Run were
crucially dependent for their survival on foodstuffs and water reaching them
from Great Banda. In other words, a Dutch conquest of the island would make
it impossible for the English to continue in actual possession of Pulo Run.
The strategy proved effective. Inhabitants of Great Banda repulsed Lam’s
expeditionary force in June 1618, but were soundly defeated by GovernorGeneral Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587-1629) three years later. Coen commanded a
formidable naval and military force of sixteen warships and nearly a thousand
soldiers. The Treaty of Defence concluded by the VOC and EIC in London in

June 1619 proved an unexpected benefit in pacifying the archipelago. Since the
companies were now officially allied, neither the EIC merchants in Bantam
and Jakarta, nor the few Englishmen left at Pulo Run, dared to interfere with
Coen’s invasion plans or offer any support to the Bandanese.17
Coen’s brutal conquest of Great Banda presents an inconvenient truth
for many global historians writing today who are eager to ascribe agency
to indigenous peoples through various forms of ‘negotiating’ and ‘resisting’
empire. Yet the power differential between Europeans and certain native
groups in Asia and the Americas is something that we ignore at our peril. At
the time, many Bandanese clearly underestimated the VOC’s determination
to secure a monopoly of the spice trade and the enormous resources which
it could marshal against a weak, isolated polity. Of course, there were plenty
of areas in the pre-modern world where Europeans struggled to get a foot
in the door, but the Banda Islands were not one of these.18
Coen’s punitive expedition resulted in the near-total destruction of
Bandanese society. Forty-eight orangkayas were captured, tried, and executed at his order and approximately 789 old men, women, and children
were shipped off to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta), the VOC headquarters
in Asia, where they were put to work as slaves. In the end, there were only
about a thousand of an estimated 15,000 original inhabitants left in the
Banda Islands. The arable land on Great Banda was divided into plots
called perken, and distributed among European tenants. Many of these
so-called perkeniers were former VOC soldiers. Together with Company
officials, they would form the elite level of the new colonial society for
centuries to come. In their cultivation and harvesting of the valuable spices
they could dispose of a large labour force of slaves, imported by the VOC
from all parts of Asia. The Dutch conquest, then, marked a fundamental
break with the past.19
17 Van Goor, Jan Pieterszoon Coen, pp. 433–65; Loth, ‘Armed Incidents and Unpaid Bills’, pp. 724–27.
18 On indigenous peoples ‘negotiating’ and ‘resisting’ empire, see e.g. Belmessous, Empire by
Treaty; Belmessous, Native Claims; Meuwese, Brothers in Arms; Clulow, ‘The Art of Claiming’.
Clulow emphasises Bandanese legal resistance against the Dutch. He shows how, through both
treaty texts and indigenous ceremonies, certain Bandanese groups successfully manipulated the
English into supporting them against the VOC. Clulow recognises, however, that the English put
their own spin on the treaty texts, and tended to overstate their case in negotiations with the
VOC. The VOC repaid the compliment, of course: it routinely over-interpreted its treaties with
indigenous rulers and peoples, if doing so served its own interest.

of the Banda Islands. Inevitably, a degree of racial mixing occurred, with perkeniers routinely

In this way, the Bandanese were the victims of Anglo-Dutch imperial
competition in Asia. Caught in a downward spiral of increasingly brutal
violence, their room for manoeuvre diminished rapidly. Appeals for help
to EIC servants and indigenous leaders elsewhere (the rulers of Ternate,
Makassar, and Bantam, among others) went unheeded or did not have the
desired effect, in large part due to internal divisions among the Bandanese.
If there was a ‘middle ground’ in the Banda Islands (i.e. an equilibrium of
native and European power), it can only have existed for a fleeting moment
in the 1610s. A toxic combination of warfare and treaty-making stripped
the Bandanese of their sovereignty. From a European perspective, treaties
with indigenous peoples were never meant to be agreements between
equals. Even English assistance against Dutch aggression came at a high
price for the Bandanese: according to the treaty concluded with Nathaniel
Courthope in December 1616, they did not just promise the EIC all spices
harvested on Pulo Run in perpetuity, but also surrendered the island to
James I of England and put themselves under the latter’s protection as
his subjects. It was all to no avail. Lacking suff icient EIC support, the
game was up for the inhabitants of Pulo Run by the time Coen arrived in
February 1621.20
It is instructive to compare and contrast the Dutch imperial projects in
the Hudson Valley and Banda Islands in the seventeenth century. Although
these areas are usually treated separately, there are clear parallels in terms
of Dutch claims-making and ensuing conflicts with indigenous peoples
and European competitors. Thanks to the sovereign powers delegated by
the Dutch States General, the VOC and WIC were able to conclude treaties
of alliance with native peoples, impose protection/tribute exchanges on
them, and insert themselves as co-rulers in far-flung areas of the world.
Fortresses – even if these just consisted of blockhouses – functioned as
nuclei of Dutch sovereignty, radiating influence outward. Both companies
employed soldiers to enforce their own interpretations of treaties concluded
with indigenous peoples. Warfare and treaty-making went hand in hand
in these imperial projects.

marrying slave women. Although a steady trickle of slaves escaped to other nearby archipelagos, marronage never threatened colonial society in the Banda Islands. At the end of the
eighteenth century, slave numbers had increased to 4,112, constituting three-quarters of the
islands’ population.

Treaty-making and armed conflict in New Netherland
In September 1609, Henry Hudson – then employed by the VOC – sailed
up the river that would later be named after him. He explored it as far
as present-day Albany in New York State. The journal of Robert Juet of
Limehouse, an officer aboard the Halve Maen, reveals that Hudson engaged
in both trade and armed conflict with the various Munsee bands that lived
along the river’s shores. Juet recorded that the local people offered food and
tobacco to their uninvited guests, while also exchanging furs for European
trade goods. Yet Hudson and his men lived in constant fear of a surprise
attack by the far more numerous locals – as Juet noted, we ‘durst not trust
them’. In the space of two months, a number of the local inhabitants were
captured and killed for supposedly posing a threat to the Halve Maen and
its crew. It was a harbinger of things to come.21 In the wake of Hudson’s
voyage, Dutch merchants visited the river in increasing numbers during
the 1610s and 1620s.
This period has given rise to a number of controversies over agreements
supposedly concluded between the Dutch and local groups, which must be
considered in any analysis. One such controversy centres on the Tawagonshi
Document, which the Onandaga Nation in New York State considers a
genuine 1613 treaty between ‘the chiefs of the Long House’ and two Dutch
merchants, Jacob Eelckens and Hendrick Christiaenssen.22 Allegedly, it
guaranteed each of the signatory parties the right to self-determination
and non-interference. If true, it would show a considerable degree of local
agency in the face of European incursion. Yet there is good reason to question
the validity of this document, as historians and linguists recently did in a
special issue of the Journal of Early American History (2013).
Jaap Jacobs notes in his contribution to this special issue that there were
no Dutch plans for settlement in the Hudson Valley prior to the WIC’s
founding. Dutch merchants simply sailed up the river for the summer
trading season. The companies that employed them were relatively shortlived enterprises, and lacked the sovereign powers that the Dutch States
General would bestow on the WIC in 1621. By virtue of its charter, the New
Netherland Company (1614-1618) enjoyed a monopoly over all Dutch trade

in America, pp. 37–47. As Paul Otto notes, archaeological evidence suggests that indigenous
peoples in the Northeast first obtained European trade goods from French merchants on the
St. Lawrence River in the mid-sixteenth century.

perspective at least, purely private agreements.23

At the same time, linguistic evidence suggests that the Tawagonshi Document cannot be a seventeenth-century Dutch text. The document – which
is only available to scholars as a 1959 photocopy – contains a number of
spelling and grammatical mistakes, along with Anglicisms and various
other word forms and meanings unknown to seventeenth-century Dutch.
It was, in all likelihood, the handiwork of the American physician Lawrence
G. van Loon (1902-1982), who was notorious for his forgeries of historical
documents relating to the history of Dutch New York.24
Similar concerns apply to the Two Row Wampum Belt, another controversial artifact supposedly from this period of initial contact. For the Onandaga
Nation and other indigenous groups in the United States and Canada, it
symbolises the treaty allegedly concluded with the Dutch four hundred years
ago.25 Crafted from marine shell, the Two Row Wampum Belt consists of
two rows of purple beads set against a background of white beads. As Otto
notes, indigenous peoples of the Hudson Valley did not start to produce
purple beads until the 1630s or later. The purple beads are made from the
dark purple section of the Quahog clam shells (Mercenaria mercinaria), the
outer surface of which is so hard as to require the use of European-supplied
metal drills. These were in short supply in the Hudson Valley in 1613. Although
seventeenth-century oral traditions may have associated the Two Row
Wampum Belt with an agreement between natives and Dutch merchants
concluded before the 1630s, it is far more likely a recent development.26
If we do not accept the Tawagonshi Document and Two Row Wampum
Belt as reliable sources, are there other seventeenth and eighteenth-century
documents which speak to European–indigenous relations in the Hudson
Valley and reflect a wider consensus about non-interference? In his contribution to the special issue of the Journal of Early American History, the
historian Jon Parmenter accepts that the so-called Tawagonshi Document
is a fake, but argues that the Western documentary record still corroborates
the Haudenosaunee tradition of kaswentha, which stresses ‘the distinct
24 Hermkens, Noordegraaf and van der Sijs, ‘The Tawagonshi Tale’. The article suggests
that, in 1978, van Loon gave ‘the original piece of hide’ – which he identified as the original of
the ‘Tawagonshi Treaty’ – to two Onondaga chiefs, Leon Shenandoah and Irving Powless, for
safekeeping in the Syracuse, NY, headquarters of the People of the Longhouse. So far, scholars
have been unable to examine this ‘original piece of hide’.

identity of the two peoples and a mutual engagement to coexist in peace
without interference in the affairs of the other’. According to Parmenter,
Haudenosaunee speakers explicitly mentioned or recited the kaswentha
tradition for Anglo-American and French colonial audiences on at least fifteen
different occasions between 1656 and 1744.27 However, as Parmenter admits,
contemporary written records of negotiations between French and English
officials and the Five, later Six, Nations do not make any reference to the Two
Row Wampum Belt specifically. In his efforts to find continuity over time,
Parmenter tends to emphasise elements in the recitations that correspond with
the current concept of kaswentha, while ignoring contradictory elements.28
Parmenter is correct that the idea of a covenant chain can be found in
the Haudenosaunee recitations. But who were the European interlocutors
with whom Haudenosaunee speakers wished to affirm bonds of ‘friendship’
and ‘good understanding’? According to the Jesuit Relations, a Mohawk
chief handed a ‘great collar of Porcelain beads’ (i.e. wampum beads) to the
French governor at Trois-Rivières in April 1656, claiming that he would tie
the Dutch, the French, and the ‘Agnieronnons’ together by means of this ‘iron
chain, much larger than the trees that grow in our forests’.29 The Mohawk
chief did not wish for Europeans and native peoples to co-exist in isolation
from one another. If any misfortune should happen to the French and
‘Agnieronnons’, they would mingle their ‘weeping’ and ‘tears’. He requested
that the French governor close the doors of ‘his houses and his forts’ to the
‘Onnontageronnon’, enemies of the speaker, who were hatching ‘some plot
of war against me’.30 The Mohawk chief, then, sought French assistance
and cooperation for the next round of warfare.
Such accounts show that indigenous groups sought to play off different
European groups against each other. When Onondaga chiefs appeared
before the New York Commissioners for Indian Affairs in Albany in 1678,
they did so to ally themselves with the English as successors of the Dutch.
An ‘ancient covenant’, allegedly dating back to the days of Jacob Eelckens
and Arent van Curler (two Dutch merchants who had traded in the Hudson
Valley in the 1610s and 1630s), was said to have ‘continued to the Time of Old
Corlaer [Curler] and from Old Corlaer to His Present Excellency’, meaning
Sir Edmund Andros, governor of New York.31

It is clear from other recitations at Albany in the years following that
indigenous peoples did not interpret the covenant chain as signifying
peaceful coexistence without interference in the affairs of the other. When
the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, and Senecas affirmed their ‘covenant
of friendship’ with ‘Christians’ in 1691, they took it to mean that ‘whoever
should hurt or prejudice, the one should be guilty of injuring all, all of us
being comprehended in one common league’. In 1694, representatives of
the Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, and Mohawks recounted that
when ‘Christians’ first arrived in the Hudson Valley and were still ‘but a
Small People’, they had not just extended a hand of friendship, but also
entered into an alliance with the ‘Christians’ in order to protect the latter
‘from all enemies whatsoever’.32 This does not amount, as is claimed, to a
policy of non-interference. As late as 1751, Archibald Kennedy of the New
York Council echoed the Five Nations’ understanding of the covenanting
chain when he declared that ‘we [the English] have assisted them in their
wars and wants, and they have assisted us in our wars, and we have their
Furs. This is the original Contract and Treaty of Commerce with the Five
Nations.’33 On balance, the evidence suggests that the modern concept of
kaswentha was unknown to both European and indigenous inhabitants
of the upper Hudson and St. Lawrence River valleys in the early modern
period. As a result, we should be cautious of reading too much into such
sources.
What can we say, then, about the situation on the ground? As Otto
shows in The Dutch-Munsee Encounter in America (2006), Dutch trade and
settlement in the lower Hudson Valley led to increasing conflict and war
with local Munsee bands in the 1640s and 1650s, resulting in the latter’s
submission to Dutch sovereignty. European settlement, particularly land
purchases, was key in this respect. Initially, indigenous views of land
ownership and sovereignty differed radically from the Dutch perspective.
When Indian leaders signed agreements ‘selling’ their land, they agreed to
its joint use and occupancy by both themselves and the Dutch. They did
not envision anything like a permanent transfer of land or sovereignty to
recordings of Indian speech. The treaty minutes require critical analysis just like any other
historical document. Still, Richter believes that no other Euro-American source has preserved
‘the memoir of Indian thoughts, concerns, and interpretation of events’ with less distortion than
the treaty minutes. It is, quite literally, as close as we are going to get to the words and thoughts
of illiterate indigenous peoples in the Northeast in the pre-modern period.

the Dutch. The Munsees who ‘sold’ Manhattan island in summer 1626 for
European trade goods worth 60 Dutch guilders continued to live there, as
did their counterparts on Staten Island, who ended up ‘selling’ the land
several times over the years. As Otto notes, land transactions served to
shore up social cohesion among the Munsees at a time when individualistic
trade exchanges with European settlers tended to undermine traditional
tribal leadership. Land transactions allowed Indian leaders to reassert
their influence through the distribution of gifts among tribal members.
Indian leaders may also have believed that land transactions would
ensure continued access to European goods. By officially meeting Dutch
magistrates to finalise land transactions, they gave the magistrates the
impression, however, that permanent control over a territory had been
ceded, along with sovereignty.34
The decline of the beaver trade in the lower Hudson Valley served to fuel
land transactions as well. No longer able to supply valuable furs, the Munsees
could offer instead food for subsistence, wampum for trade, information
about the continent’s interior, and, of course, land for habitation. By 1645,
the Dutch population in the Hudson Valley had reached approximately
2,500. Many colonists settled in the outlying areas around Manhattan in
order to be able to trade with nearby Munsee villages.35
Increased contact between settlers and the local people resulted in greater
tension and conflict. Settlers sought to employ Indians as domestic servants,
for example, only to find that they were not accustomed to Dutch concepts
of wage labour, and disappeared as soon as they became weary of the work.
The Indians’ unfenced gardens, essential for their cultivation of corns and
beans, proved vulnerable to European livestock foraging freely in the woods.
To protect their crops, Indians frequently killed the animals. This did nothing
to improve native–European relations.36
Growing Indian dependence on European trade goods had a number of
dismal effects, which ranged from alcoholism among aboriginal peoples
to yet more land transactions, resulting in the loss of indigenous political
power and sovereignty. In January 1639, a group of Indians that lived on
Long Island sold one-third of the island to the Dutch West India Company.
They explicitly renounced all ‘authority over it’ and placed themselves under
WIC protection, but, crucially, reserved for themselves the right ‘to remain
upon the aforesaid land, plant corn, fish, hunt and make a living there as

well as they can’.37 As Otto notes, this group of Indians were undoubtedly
wampum producers who had been fully integrated into the European market
economy. They required sufficient land for the year-round production of
wampum, but little else. By the 1640s, wampum had become the currency
of choice for European settlers in the Dutch and English colonies in the
Northeast (while retaining important spiritual meanings for aboriginal
peoples). Other Munsee bands that lived close to the Dutch population
centres on Manhattan faced a catastrophic situation. With little access to
beaver pelts and wampum, the Hackensacks, Tappans, and Wiechquaeskecks
found themselves surrounded by settlers and more powerful Indian groups.38
The tipping point was reached in September 1639 when Director Willem
Kieft decided to impose a protection/tribute exchange on all Munsee bands
living near Fort Amsterdam. Indians whom ‘we have protected against their
enemies’ were told to pay a levy of beaver pelts, sweet corn, and wampum
in order to defray the spiralling costs of Dutch garrisons and fortresses.39
Kieft’s proposals found little favour from the indigenous inhabitants of
the lower Hudson Valley. One second-hand report in Dutch suggests that
representatives of several Munsee bands travelled to Fort Amsterdam to
offer a spirited rebuttal. If this report is to be believed, a Munsee spokesman
explained to Kieft that Dutch soldiers would be totally useless to them ‘in
case of war with other nations’. It took far too long for news to reach Fort
Amsterdam, ‘which was at a great distance from them’. Moreover, they
had allowed the Dutch to settle peaceably on their land, without imposing
any charge, which meant that the Dutch were ‘under obligation to them’,
not the other way around. They reminded Kieft that, for two winters in a
row, Dutchmen marooned in the Hudson Valley had been cared for by the
locals, who had supplied victuals and assisted in the repair of the ship. The
Munsees had always traded on a quid-pro-quo basis with the Dutch and
saw no reason to supply Kieft ‘with maize for nothing’. Although the Dutch
now inhabited some of their land, they were still ‘masters’ (meesters) of the
land they yet possessed. 40

leaders appeared before the Director and Council of New Netherland on 15 January 1639. A

As Otto notes, the underlying theme of these complaints is Munsee
frustration with the Dutch failure of social reciprocity. ‘Until this time,
the Munsees had engaged in a range of exchanges with the Dutch – food,
comfort, wampum, hospitality – which, from their perspective, kept their
world in balance.’41 Kieft’s levy presented a significant challenge to the
Indians’ worldview. On this occasion, the giving of gifts would not be
matched with reciprocal exchanges. David de Vries, a Dutch merchant
trusted by the Munsees, witnessed their dissatisfaction first-hand in October
1639. Eager to exchange cloth for sweet corn, De Vries was told by his Tappan interlocutors to wait until the WIC sloop collecting the levy had left.
Following its departure, they expressed their dismay that Kieft ‘dare […]
exact it’. The Dutch Director-General had to be ‘a very mean fellow’, first
to come to the Hudson Valley uninvited and then to command the locals
‘to give him their corn for nothing’. 42
In spring 1640, hostilities broke out with the native inhabitants of the
Raritan Valley (currently in northern New Jersey). Other Munsee bands
quickly became involved in the conflict as well. The First Dutch–Munsee War
lasted until 1645, and was marked by carnage on both sides. Indians attacked
isolated Dutch farmsteads, killing colonists and livestock, while burning
down houses, barns, etc. WIC soldiers committed atrocities against Indian
villages, with the most notorious campaign led by Captain John Underhill.
Married to a Dutch woman, Underhill was a veteran of New England’s Pequot
War. He had been responsible for the massacre of an entire Pequot village at
Mystic River in 1637. He reprised this feat in WIC employ in February 1644.
At night, he arrayed his troops around a fortified Tankitekes village near
modern Pound Ridge, New York, and ordered his men to open fire. When
the Indians refused to fight, he ordered his men to torch the entire village,
knowing full well that the inhabitants would prefer a fiery death to slaughter
at the hands of WIC soldiers. Over five hundred Indians were killed on this
occasion. According to Otto, the entire conflict cost the lives of 1,600 native
people at least. On the Dutch side, many European settlers left the colony or
retreated to Manhattan island and Long Island. In 1648, one settler made the
dramatic claim that, apart from private traders and WIC personnel, there
were just one hundred colonists left in New Netherland. Yet the conflict hit

the Munsees hardest. Demographic catastrophe (caused by European disease)
went hand-in-hand with the collapse of indigenous political structures. For
many Munsees in the lower Hudson Valley, the overlordship that the WIC
claimed over New Netherland had become a reality. 43
European migration to New Netherland recovered during Peter
Stuyvesant’s tenure as Director-General. There were about 2,000 colonists
living in the Hudson Valley by the time of the English takeover in 1664. As
before, increasing population pressure resulted in conflicts with native
villages. Stuyvesant waged a Second Dutch–Munsee War in 1655-1657
and took on the Esopus Indians in 1659-1660. Signif icantly, many of
the Munsee bands on Long Island – wampum producers living close to
European population centres – pledged to keep the peace with Stuyvesant,
and assist him in his f ight against Indian aggressors. As Otto notes, it
was symptomatic of ‘decreasing Indian sovereignty radiating out from

Manhattan Island’. 44 After 1656, the Munsees no longer occupied or visited
Manhattan in signif icant numbers. In July 1657, Staten Island – ‘by us
called Eghquaons’ – was sold to the Dutch as ‘free hereditable property,
now and forever, without any further claims to be made by us or our
descendants’. 45 Signif icantly, the 20 Munsee leaders who signed the

latter were under attack from other Indian groups. Treaties and property
deeds now signif ied wholesale Munsee subjection to the Dutch. It was

understood as such by both sides. Meeting Stuyvesant at Fort Orange
(modern-day Albany) in July 1660, the Senecas did not just endorse his
peace treaty with the defeated Esopus Indians, but also recognised the
Dutch as ‘masters of the country’ (ooversten vant heele landt), ‘to whom
we all look up’. 46

Conclusion
Warfare and treaty-making were inextricably intertwined in European
imperial projects. In many cases, the result was the ‘dispossession of the
native’, either by incorporating individual Indians into colonial society, as
happened to the wampum-producing Munsees of Long Island, or by pushing
indigenous peoples out, as happened to the Esopus Indians in the Hudson
Valley, or by exterminating the local population, as happened in the Banda

Islands. Given this dismal record, was there such a thing as empire by treaty?
The case studies discussed here suggest that treaties, trading contracts,
and land deeds played an important role in European expansion overseas.
Crucially however, written documents were not an alternative to conflict and
war, but rather an essential part of it. These tools of empire served multiple
purposes, which ranged from diplomatic negotiations between European
powers to, as Herzog puts it, ‘the subjection of all things indigenous’. 47 The
modern notion of equal treaties was totally unknown to Europeans in the
early modern period, and, arguably, to many local rulers and peoples in
Asia and the Americas. It was simply a given that relations between human
beings, whether as individuals or groups, were ordered hierarchically. High
literacy rates in northwestern Europe in the early modern period ensured
that English and Dutch colonial officials, merchants, and colonists sought
to preserve these hierarchical relations in writing. Indigenous peoples past
and present have sought to use legal systems originating in Europe to contest
the meaning of written documents and offer their own readings. Yet the
decks remain heavily stacked against them. In the early modern period, the
ultimate aim of treaties concluded between Europeans and native rulers
and peoples was the subjection of one or more groups of human beings by
others. There is a great danger that the ‘fetishism’ of treaties will continue
to reinscribe itself in contemporary international relations.
