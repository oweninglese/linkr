Aboriginal Peoples and Homelessness:
Interviews with Service Providers

Résumé

L'auteur a mené, à la fin 1996, une consultation auprès de 19 agences et groupes
canadiens qui donnent des services aux Autochtones sans abri et à ceux qui sont à
risque de le devenir. Cette consultation apporte un éclairage sur le niveau d'itinérance
chez les Autochtones, sur les problèmes vécus par les Autochtones sans abri, sur les
services communautaires qui leur sont accessibles, sur les rapports entre l'itinérance et
la discrimination dans le marché du logement, sur les moyens de réduire l'itinérance
Autochtone, ainsi que sur le rôle que les ministères et agences gouvernementales peuvent

jouer à cette fin. Les résultats révèlent que les Autochtones forment une grande part de

la population des sans-abri, que les besoins des Autochtones sans abri ou à risque de le
devenir vont croissant et que les organismes de services et les agences autochtones
consacrent présentement des efforts importants pour apporter une réponse à cette situ-

ation. Il faut noter que la consultation dont il est question dans cet article fait partie
d'une étude plus large de la littérature sur les peuples autochtones et l'itinérance menée

pour le compte de la Société canadienne d'hypothèques et de logement.

Introduction
In late 1996, the Institute of Urban Studies, The University of Winnipeg,

undertook a review of the literature on Aboriginal peoples and homelessness

for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.1 Overall, the review
found that very little research has been done on the nature and extent of

homelessness among Aboriginal persons in Canada. There is a widespread
perception, and much anecdotal evidence, that Aboriginals figure disproportionately among the homeless, and suffer acutely from many social ills that
place people "at risk" of homelessness.2 However, questions concerning the
number of Aboriginal persons affected, the geographical distribution of the
Aboriginal homeless, which sub-populations are at highest risk, the extent of
homelessness in rural Aboriginal communities, and above all, the best ways
to address Aboriginal homelessness, remain largely unanswered.3

Nancy Klos is a Research Associate at the Institute of Urban Studies, The Univer-

sity of Winnipeg, 346 Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, MB R3C 0C3.

Canadian Journal of Urban Research

A small but significant part of the project required interviews with aca-

demics with expertise in the field of Aboriginal homelessness, and profes-

sionals who provide services to the homeless. Significantly, none of the
dozen or so academics contacted professed any real expertise in this area, and

few felt able to offer any substantive observations. Telephone interviews
with 19 service providers across Canada, however, were more fruitful (see
Table 1), and provided some preliminary insights into some of the questions
raised above. This research note summarizes the interviews with service

providers. It is offered in response to the paucity of information on this
emerging social issue, and in the hopes that it will stimulate much-needed
research on the many relevant issues.

The Questions
A substantial number of agencies and groups provide life support and
treatment programs for homeless persons. The variety of agencies and groups
reflects the diversity of needs and diversity of the homeless population. The

number of agencies and groups that provide assistance primarily to
Aboriginal homeless persons is still relatively low, although Aboriginal persons are able to gain access to programs and services that are offered to the homeless population at large. A selection of agencies and groups
in different parts of the country were contacted for their first-hand knowledge

and impressions of Aboriginal homelessness, and to provide input for the
following questions:
1. Are there Aboriginals among the homeless population in your facility? What
percentage of the total client group do they constitute? What are the general

characteristics of the Aboriginal homeless in your facility?
2. Is Aboriginal homelessness on the increase or decrease in your community?
3. Are the Aboriginal homeless long-term residents of the community or recent arrivals from reserves? Do the Aboriginal homeless have relatives/
families in the city?

4. Are the Aboriginal homeless well served by the current facilities? Should
facilities be designed specifically for Aboriginals, i.e., in more culturally
appropriate ways?
5. Is discrimination in the housing market a factor in creating homelessness
among Aboriginal people? What other housing market factors play a role in
Aboriginal homelessness?
6. What do you feel would be most important in reducing the level of Aboriginal homelessness?

7. What departments or agencies should be involved in addressing the problem of Aboriginal homelessness? What department or agency should play

the lead role?

Below, the service providers' answers tojhese questions will be summarized, and illustrated by direct quotations or paraphrases of some of their
comments.

The Responses
Demographic Aspects

Among the agencies and groups consulted, there is agreement that the

Aboriginal homeless population is not gender- or age-specific. Tho

Aboriginals who can be classified as homeless include both males and fema

as well as adults, youth and the elderly. The majority of homeless Aborigina

tend to be males, and many are in the 30-45 age category. The gender and
age of Aboriginal homeless persons vary almost daily in shelters and servi

agencies across Canada. For example:
• At the Downtown Eastside Residents' Association in Vancouver,
homelessness among Aboriginals is most common among males over 3035 years of age. There are few women among the Aboriginal homeless in
Vancouver.

• About 10% of the clientele at men's shelters in the Ottawa-Carleton area

are Aboriginal, i.e., in a shelter with 100 persons, at least 10 would be Aboriginal. There is also the "at-risk," marginally housed population that lives

in cheap housing such as rooming houses.
• In Edmonton, at least half of the clientele of the George Spady Centre is
Aboriginal, and appear to be increasingly younger than 45 years of age. Of
their clientele, at least 90% are males, while 10% are females.
• At the Main Street Project in Winnipeg, the average age of the clientele is
39 years, and considerably more than half of the clientele are Aboriginal.
Although their numbers are variable, almost 75% are males and 25% are
females.

• Through its member organisations, the Streethealth Coalition serves a large

Native and Inuit population in inner-city Ottawa. Together, they make up
almost 30% of the clientele. The overwhelming majority are under 50 years
of age.

• Ndinawemaaganag Endaawaad Inc. provides emergency shelter for runaway, homeless youth in Winnipeg. Approximately 70% of their clientele
is usually Aboriginal, and gender of clients is variable.

• Among the clientele of the Calgary Drop In Centre, 17% are Aboriginal,
although the numbers increase and decrease. There are usually more males
than females. Almost 60% are males, while about 40% are females.

• The Salvation Army Connection Program in Yellowknife also provides

emergency assistance to the homeless, including shelter and food hampers.

Of those who rely on the Connection Program for emergency food assistance, about 70% are Aboriginal.
• At the YWCA in Saskatoon, the clientele in the emergency and long-term
shelter facilities last year included 507 adult women, 55 youth (less than 16)
and 395 children. Between July 1995 and June 1996, 230 women clients
identified themselves as Aboriginal.
• The Calgary Urban Project Society (CUPS) is a community health centre in
downtown Calgary. In December 1996, about 5 1% of the clients using the
outreach program and counselling and referral services were Aboriginal. In
the Family Resource Centre, less than 50% of the clients are Aboriginal.
Aboriginal clients of the outreach program are mostly adults in the 20-49
age category, although they tend to be towards the upper limit of that age
range.

Problems Experienced by the Aboriginal Homeless
The problems of the Aboriginal homeless are in many ways similar to the

problems faced by the non-Aboriginal homeless population, although it is
acknowledged that Aboriginals stand out as the truly disadvantaged. Common problems indicated related to substance/chemical abuse and addiction,
and a lack of life and job skills. These can become deep-seated problems,
especially for Aboriginal survivors of childhood sexual abuse and the residential school system. In Yellowknife, gambling addiction specifically is a problem; in the far North, unemployment or underemployment is a major prob-

lem. Health, and particularly mental health problems, are also prevalent
among the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal homeless population. At the Main
Street Project, the number of homeless persons who have mental health problems has become statistically significant, but there is no difference in the
numbers for Aboriginals compared to non- Aboriginals. At the Calgary Ur-

ban Project Society, violence (both at home and on the street), substance
abuse and mental health issues are prevalent among the Aboriginal and nonAboriginal clientele. Aboriginals, in particular, are more affected by substance abuse and less by mental health problems, although there are secondary mental health issues that stem from substance abuse.
The problems of the Aboriginal homeless apply to males and females as
well as youth. Aboriginal homeless youth and Indigenous women face significant challenges. For example:

• Youth at Ndinawemaaganag Endaawaad Inc. usually have family conflict
issues, substance and alcohol abuse problems and inhalant abuse problems.
Some of these youths also have problems related to gang involvement or

association with gang members.
• At the Vancouver Native Health Society, problems among high-risk youths
include the sex trade and addiction.

• At the Native Women's Shelter in Montreal, the majority of residents experienced abuse in Northern communities, including both physical and mental

abuse. In the city, they encounter language problems, economic difficulties

and problems associated with few job skills.
• Since the 1970s, Chez Doris has provided assistance to Inuit and non-Inuit
women at risk both on the street and in unstable lives. Inuit women primarily come to the Montreal facility with drug and alcohol problems. Some
turn to Chez Doris to escape incestuous relationships from their homes in
the North; some have tested positive for HIV and AIDS.
• The Aboriginal clients of the YWCA in Saskatoon face problems related to
family violence, poverty, addiction, hypermobility and a lack of suitable
and stable housing.

Extent of Aboriginal Homelessness
For ethnic reasons, Aboriginals are usually conspicuous among the home-

less population in Canada. Across the country, however, there is no clear
consensus that their present numbers are either increasing or decreasing. Media

stories have done much to convince the Canadian public that the Aboriginal
homeless population is skyrocketing.
Some notable increases have been reported among youth, while the num-

ber of needy Aboriginal families has also increased. Among shelters and
service agencies that assist the homeless, there still appear to be strong seasonal variations in the size of the Aboriginal homeless population, especially
in the North. In the winter months, shelters and service agencies across the
country are regularly at full capacity.

• About 10 years ago, Inuit women made up only 3-4% of the clientele at
Chez Doris; five years ago, the percentage had risen to 7-14% ; now, they
number 14% of the clientele.

• The number of persons who come to the Saskatoon YWCA and declare
their Aboriginal status has remained fairly constant, while at the Native
Women's Shelter in Montreal, the number of Aboriginal women has increased gradually for at least the last eight years.

• The Salvation Army Family and Community Services Department in
Winnipeg provides food assistance primarily to needy Aboriginal families
in the Main Street/core area. Between 200 and 300 families rely on food
assistance each month, and the number has been increasing every year for
the last 3-4 years.

Research Note

• "In 1992, the Annishnawbe Street Patrol in Toronto served 1 1 ,534 home-

less people. In 1995, this figure sharply rose to 19,399, a staggering surg
of 73% . The last nine months of 1995 alone showed a 43% increase over
the same period in 1994" (quotation from service provider). On average,
25-30% of their clientele is Aboriginal.
• The homeless population in the Ottawa-Carleton region is estimated to be
about 5,000. In the last eight years, there has been explosive growth in the
Native and Inuit clientele of the Streethealth Coalition.

• Over the last six months, the Native Men's Residence Street Patrol in Toronto

reports that the number of Aboriginals has gone from 30% to 20%. On a
recent night out, the Street Patrol recorded 118 persons; of these, 33 were
Aboriginal.
• On Baffin Island in the Eastern Arctic, the size of the homeless population
and any growth trends is unclear. Homelessness within communities is invisible; lots of homelessness is looked after by relatives and friends. As a
result, houses and apartments are commonly overcrowded.
• There are noticeable cycles in the numbers of clients at the Calgary Urban
Project Society. The number of Aboriginal clients has recently increased by
about 1 0%. The increase has been attributed to the closure of an Aboriginal

service agency in downtown Calgary.

Rural-Urban Migration
The Aboriginal homeless clients are generally not from one specific locale. While the proportions vary, a considerable number of Aboriginal home-

less persons are long-term residents of the reserve and migrate between the
reserve and the city. Age may be a contributing factor; the older the person,
the less likely they will migrate between cities and from the reserve to the
city. Across the country, shelters and service agencies that provide assistance
to the Aboriginal homeless population report that many are long-term clients
and that they tend to frequent those places where they feel comfortable. If
they do have families or relatives in the community, the families and relatives
are usually equally needy. Farther North, income and employment are important factors in the decision to leave a reserve or move to another community, where the situation may be no better. In the North, persons are more
likely to move between communities and stay with family and/or friends.
• At Street City in Toronto, half the Aboriginal homeless clientele are from
the street and half come from up North. Most do not have families in Toronto;

their families are commonly out East or in places like Winnipeg.
• A wide variety of communities are represented in men's shelters in OttawaCarleton - persons from farth'er north, south, east and west. Many stay in

the shelters for long periods of time, some just briefly.

• The Main Street Project identifies three generations of Aboriginals in
Winnipeg's core area: the group who are long-term residents of the reserves;

the group that have spent half their lives on a reserve and the other half in

the city; and the kids who were raised in the city and who are increasingly
having children of their own. In Winnipeg, the urban Aboriginal population
has grown rapidly.
• Inuit women at Chez Doris have generally been living in Montreal for at

least five years. Many do not have family in the city who can be of assistance. Some of the Indigenous clientele are parents, but due to their unstable lives, many do not have custody of their children.
• The origins of the Aboriginal clientele at the Calgary Urban Project Society
are mixed. At least 80% of the Aboriginal clientele have been on the streets
for some time.

• Many of the clients of the Salvation Army Connection Program in
Yellowknife are long-term residents of the community. Due to the high cost
of living, they are often forced to stay with numerous other family members

or friends in limited accommodations. Most are unable to leave in order to
return to their homes in other communities, which may be hundreds of miles
away.

• The Native and Inuit clientele of the Streethealth Coalition are very mobile.

Native clients have come from across Canada; some from as far away as
New Brunswick.

Appropriateness of Services
Cutbacks at all levels of government have had a detrimental effect on the
homeless, and current facilities are definitely challenged in meeting the needs

of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal homeless. The provision of culturally
appropriate facilities for Aboriginals is an important issue, and shelters and
service agencies have become increasingly sensitive to Aboriginal culture in

response to the needs of their clientele. Those groups and agencies that
provide assistance primarily to Aboriginal homeless persons are taking a lead
role in creating culturally sensitive facilities for the Aboriginal population.
For example, Anishnawbe Health Toronto incorporates traditional healers,
traditional healing approaches and teachings, and arranges for clients to at-

tend ceremonies and healings at reserve communities. In Ottawa, the
Streethealth Coalition is currently working on plans to open an Artists' Co-op
for Aboriginal and other homeless artists.

• "The Aboriginal clientele is well served and Aboriginal facilities are well
used. We need more of what we have for all homeless persons. We must

support Aboriginal-owned and operated facilities in the community." (Sal-

vation Army Family and Community Services Department)
• At the Calgary Urban Project Society, an important part of the approach to
Aboriginals and their problems is a mix of workers at the centre, including

Ab'originals and non-Aboriginals. Sometimes, Aboriginal clients want to
talk to an Aboriginal worker at the centre, while at other times, they want to

talk to a non-Aboriginal worker. Since the Outreach Program began in July
1996, two out of five staff were hired because they were Aboriginal, but also

because they were qualified for the job.

• In Regina, the Salvation Army has a Casual Labour Program that provides
daily employment. Persons sign up for the day while staff try to set them up

with temporary jobs as they are required. Ninety percent of those who fre-

quent the program are Aboriginals.
• "There are nowhere near enough shelters for the homeless in the Downtown Eastside and only a few Aboriginal agencies." (Doug Kellan, DERA)
• Aboriginals in the Ottawa-Carleton area have one culture-specific treat-

ment centre and one culture-specific housing organization. In the mental
health system, there appears to be an absence of Aboriginal-specific services such as Aboriginal psychiatrists.
• The Calgary Drop In Centre tries to create a safe place for its clients, and
provide basic services such as overnight shelter, nursing services, meals,
job placements and counselling. Services are provided equally to clients,
regardless of ethnicity.
• "Aboriginals are not well served by current facilities. It is more and more
difficult for Aboriginals to get into treatment programs. The centre has more

of a focus on Aboriginal issues and has changed to accommodate Aboriginal culture." (Cecilia Blasetti, George Spady Centre)

Discrimination and Housing Market Factors
Aboriginals and the Aboriginal homeless are easy targets of discrimination in the housing market. There is a common perception that Aboriginals
on the streets are all "drunks." Perceptions can discourage landlords from
renting to needy Aboriginal tenants. Service providers report that discrimination may be a bigger problem between Aboriginals looking for housing and
landlords of certain ethnic origins.
There are Aboriginal males and females who fall into the hard-to-house
category. They face particular difficulties in locating housing, and many
never really succeed or are evicted. In most cases, needy Aboriginal families
and individuals do not have the financial resources to secure adequate housing. In the North and the far -North, housing accommodations can cost the

equivalent per month of several pay cheques. Affordable housing demand in
the North, as well as in Southern communities, is greater than the supply.

• "Discrimination is a problem for Inuit women especially in Quebec because they have poor language skills and poor English skills." (Marie Day,

Chez Doris)
• "Discrimination is a huge problem for Aboriginals. Discrimination is also
a problem in social housing projects." (Debra Mearns, Vancouver Native
Health Society)
• The Main Street Project runs a housing referral program for their clientele.
An outreach worker is the mediator between the client and the landlord.

Donations are accepted to help clients make homes for themselves. The
majority of persons stabilized as a result of the housing referral program are

Aboriginals.
• "A two-bedroom apartment can cost $1600/month in Iqaluit on Baffin Island. Most of the population's income is dedicated to rent, then food. Many
rely on welfare for low cost housing. The highest cost of living in the country is in the eastern Arctic." (Markus Wilke, CMHA, Baffin Branch)
• "Yes, probably there is discrimination [in the housing market] . We see lots
of Native discrimination in hospital services. The Native homeless do not
receive the same level of care as us." (Streethealth Coalition)
• "There is discrimination against everyone in a shelter. They are poor. Their

skin colour makes no difference." (Canadian Mental Health Association,
Ottawa-Carleton Branch)

Reducing the Level of Aboriginal Homelessness
Among shelters and service agencies, there is agreement that what is
currently being done for the Aboriginal homeless is important and needs to be

continued and expanded. The top three suggestions to reduce Aboriginal
homelessness involve additional housing programs/facilities, employment opportunities and improved life skills, as this sampling of comments indicates:

• "a Native specific centre for detox, federal and provincial support for native housing, 15-20 more beds to help deal with the problem." (Alex Jacobs

[Waasaanese], Native Men's Residence)
• "life-skills training, job experience, better literacy, better looking after their

families skills and improved morale and pride among the Aboriginal people."
(Salvation Army Family and Community Services Department)

• "Social housing programs are important in helping the homeless. These
people must have guarantees of accessibility. Aboriginals on the street need
a program to learn how to be tenants and how to maintain stable housing."

• "Native women need the skills to work in mainstream society. They need
to acquire these skills even before they come to the city - education, employment skills and overall knowledge of functioning in the city." (Native

Women's Shelter)

• "In Yellowknife, to reduce the level of homelessness, they need more than
a house; they need a goal or reason to be here. What is definitely needed are
subsidized single men's living quarters or a single men's hostel." (Peter
Skoropad, Salvation Army Connection Program)
• "There is relative homelessness on Native reserves across Canada. There

must be a provision of adequate housing. In urban centres, Natives need
help to bring up their families. They need to restore the cultural and family
structure. The same needs apply to the Inuit." (Streethealth Coalition)
• "jobs and specific training for youths and more funding to enable organizations to help youths" (Kirby Fultz, Ndinawemaaganag Endaawaad Inc.)
• "more treatment centres for substance abuse, centres that are capable of
dealing with issues specific to Aboriginal peoples." (Calgary Urban Project

Society)
• "Outreach is missing in the inner city for new arrivals to the city. There is

a need for support services such as supportive housing to help young kids
from the reserve and to stop the treadmill from the reserve to the streets."
(Cecilia Blasetti, George Spady Centre)
• "what is needed to help Aboriginals is self-esteem building, control of their
lives, not to be victimized. They need positive home environments and selfesteem to help them pursue their dreams." (Joanne Coleman Pidskalny,

YWCA)
The Role of Governments and Agencies
Several government departments/agencies were mentioned that already
have a role in addressing Aboriginal homelessness, but no one department or
agency stood out. The list included Health and Social Services departments,
Family Service departments/agencies as well as Housing departments/agen-

cies. These areas have not escaped government cutbacks, which have had
variable impacts on the problem of Aboriginal homelessness. It was suggested several times that the best option to address the problem ofAboriginal
homelessness in the future may involve a multitude of Aboriginal agencies.

• In Saskatchewan, there are promising examples of Aboriginal agencies
that may be better able to help their own people than non-Aboriginal

agencies. One example is the Métis Addiction Council which stresses
spirituality. In Regina, there is also talk of an "urban reserve." (Salvation Army Waterston Centre)

• "There is a housing crisis in Toronto. The Native housing responsibility
has been transferred from the Federal to the Provincial level. Native

persons need federal support to assist Native housing." (Alex Jacobs,

• "The Yellowknife Housing Corporation provides social housing. They
subsidize those in need and create affordable housing for single parents,
for example. There is not enough to satisfy the demand, not even close. "

(Peter Skoropad, Salvation Army Connection Program)

• There is no department or agency taking the lead on Aboriginal
homelessness in Saskatoon. Shelters are still seen as "social services"
and are segmented into departments. Two recent Aboriginal initiatives in

Saskatoon include the Healing Lodge and the Saskatoon Tribal Council
Family Wellness Centre. (Joanne Coleman Pidskany, YWCA)

• Government agencies are moving out of service delivery and more towards allocation of funding to others to provide services. Alberta Social
Services would be the lead department on Aboriginal homelessness in

Calgary. (Calgary Urban Project Society)
Conclusions
The literature review which gave rise to this research note indicated that

Aboriginal homelessness has many features in common with homelessness in
the general population, but that it also has several distinctive features. Risk

factors such as low socio-economic status, lack of adequate housing, substance abuse, physical and mental illness, release from prison, family breakdown, and a history of domestic and/or sexual abuse, can lead to homelessness
for both Aboriginals and non- Aboriginals. However, these risk factors are

more commonplace and more intensely experienced among First Nations
peoples, due to a long history of colonialism and marginalization. Racism
and discrimination are experienced by various ethnic minority groups in
Canada, but, again, Aboriginals suffer acutely from entrenched Euro-Canadian prejudices based on stereotypes about "Indians. " Risk factors distinctive

to Aboriginal homelessness include: "Third World" housing conditions on
reserve, rural-urban migration and cultural dislocation.

Similarly, many of the same strategies are recommended to address both
Aboriginal and non- Aboriginal homelessness: better access to employment
and social services, transitional housing, more social housing, refuges for
street youth and abused women and children. However, the literature indicates that the Aboriginal homeless have special needs, including improved
housing and related conditions on reserves, community development, self

determination, and access to traditional healing techniques. Shelters for Ab
original women need to be located within their own communities, and should
be geared specifically to the cultural requirements of the clientele. The nee
for Aboriginal service providers, including Native Elders/healers, is reiterated in the literature.

In general, the findings of the literature review are supported by the inter-

views with service providers summarized in this research note. However, it
should be emphasized that these conclusions are based on disparate and scanty
sources; a great deal of research on the issue of Aboriginal homelessness in
Canada remains to be done.
