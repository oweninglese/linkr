Britannic Majesty's "Sole Agent for and Superintendent of the
Affairs of our faithful subjects and allies, the six united Nations
of Indians and their Confederates in the Northern Parts of
North America," created a formal, imperial and centralized
Indian Department to direct the affairs of Native peoples on
behalf of the British Crown.1 Prior to the pivotal influence of
the regime of Sir William Johnson (1755-74), Indian affairs in

### colonial America had been marked by a long, vexing and

```
Inter-colonial land rivalries and wrangling disunity had only
further complicated British-Indian relations which fluctuated
between the benign and the intolerable. But by the 1750s, the
looming and final conflict with France for paramountcy in

### North America turned British vacillation into resolve. The

```
appointment by royal commission of a single Crown official for
the administration and management of Indian Affairs was
```

### therefore a sensible and long overdue imperial initiative.

```
Finally, after one hundred and fifty years of permanent British
settlement along the eastern shores of the "new world" a formal
and centralized policy for the indigenous or Native peoples had
emanated from Britain. The cohesive vehicle for implementing
the policy directives was the British Indian Department, the
forerunner of the present Department of Indian and Northern

and maintain the allegiance of the Native peoples to the royal
cause. As a result, and especially in the post-1774 years against
the common enemy (the Americans), an enduring and symbiotic
relationship evolved between the Native peoples and the British
Crown which was rooted in the mutual need and desire for
"protection and survival."2 British Indian policy from 1774 to
1815 was thus geared to ensure the preservation and defense of
```

### Canada through the military use and assistance of "His

Majesty's Indian Allies."  
The Native peoples were not duped by this British scheme,  
and demonstrated an equal shrewdness in manipulating Crown

### officials in order to preserve traditional tribal lands and

```
culture. Yet the fundamental and significant difference was that
the British manipulated successfully. Perhaps the Indians faced
a hopeless task in attempting to stem the tide of the frontier.
Nonetheless, the results were conclusive, for while the Iroquois
lost their ancient castles along the Finger Lakes of Upper New
York, and later the tribes of the Ohio Valley were foresaken, the
British, by securing invaluable Indian assistance, defeated the
French and then, more particularly, defended successfully the
Crown's interest in British North America from the American
invaders of 1812.
The success of British Indian policy during the pre-War of
1812 years can be demonstrated by detailing a few examples.

### Throughout the Seven Years' War, for instance, Johnson

managed to retain the loyalty of the Mohawk and others of the  
Six Nations Confederacy of Iroquois in the conflict between  
Britain and France for imperial supremacy in North America.  
His nominal victory at the battle of Lake George in September  
1755 against the French regulars of Baron Dieskau, held the  
wavering Iroquois neutral for nearly three years, in spite of  
subsequent French successes at Fort Bull and Oswego in 1756,  
Fort William Henry in 1757, and Ticonderoga in 1758. But a

### Fort Niagara in July 1759 against a French relief column,

coupled with the fall of Quebec two months later, ended French  
imperial ambitions in North America.  
In April 1775, less than a year after the death of Sir William  
Johnson, the 'shots heard round the world' at Lexington and  
Concord initiated a cruel and bitter civil war and rebellion in  
colonial America. Once again, the military support of Native  
peoples was vital to the Crown's vested interest in America.  
British Indian policy was successful during these years in large  
measure because of the several tribes that had long opposed the  
intrusion into their lands of their hereditary foe, the American  
backwoodsman. Native peoples were thus thrown into a natural

### military alliance with the British Crown, and against the

```
common enemy.

## Yet at the peace negotiations of 1783, British pleni

### potentiaries "sold the Indians to Congress" and transferred

sovereignty of all Indian?held lands south of the Great Lakes  
and west of the Mississippi River, to the new United States?  
the first abandonment.5 The warriors were "thunderstruck."  
They had not lost their war nor their land. Indeed in June and  
August 1782, the Indians had won two successive and decisive  
victories at Sandusky and Blue Licks against the Americans. In

### the latter engagement, the legendary Daniel Boone of

### Kentucky was among the routed.7 Following some hasty

```
rethinking, prompted by the fear of Indian reprisals, the British
```

### decided to retain the eastern posts; and the warriors, now

### encouraged and supplied by His Majesty's government,

continued the struggle to preserve and defend aboriginal lands.

finally collapsed at the battle of Fallen Timbers in August 1794.  
At this critical moment, the British at nearby Fort Miami,  
despite the most avowed promises to the contrary, slammed  
shut the gates of the fort, and assumed a lofty position of  
splendid isolation.8 The formalization of the Jay Treaty with  
the American republic soon after stipulated in part the removal  
of the British from the western post by June 1796. Joseph  
Brant, the Mohawk chief and Loyalist, tersely summarized the  
situation by stating that "this is the second time the poor  
Indians have been left in the lurch."

### British Indian policy between 1775 and 1796 had been

```
effective and coldly calculating. The new Loyalist settlements
```

### north of the lakes and rivers at Amherstburg, Sandwich,

```
Newark, Quinte and along the upper St. Lawrence, protected as
they had been for thirteen years by a convenient Indian barrier,
prospered and gained a measure of security, while to the south,
warriors fought and died, not to preserve and defend British
Canada, but in a vain attempt to retain ancient tribal lands.
```

### Between 1796 and 1807 the influence and prestige of the

### British Indian Department waned to insignificance as the

```
Indians were no longer needed as military allies. During these
quiet years, expenditures were drastically reduced, and the
```

### department was re-organized. In a "Plan for the Future

### Government of the Indian Department" in June 1796, the

```
position of Superintendent of Indian Affairs was established for
each of the replacement forts in Upper Canada.11 As a result,

for instance, Matthew Elliott was appointed superintendent for  
the new British post at Amherstburg. Although the traditional  
military role of the department had reached a nadir at this  
time, the superintendents were nonetheless instructed to "use

### the utmost diligence to preserve and promote friendship

```
between the troops and Indians... and to maintain harmony
```

### at the King's (new) posts."12 The wisdom of attempting to

maintain the chain of friendship alliance proved prophetic. The  
"Chesapeake Affair" of June 1807 and the bellicose reaction by  
an aroused American public for a redemption of national honor  
produced a fear of invasion in the weakly defended settlement  
of the Canadas. In particular, the position of Upper Canada was

### precarious because the defensive strategy devised by the

```
British, already heavily burdened with the Napoleonic war, was
to preserve the fortress of Quebec and subordinate all other
```

### considerations. Once again, the future security, and even

```
survival, of Upper Canada was to be largely dependent on the
allegiance and fighting qualities of His Majesty's Indian Allies.
```

### As a result, the British Indian Department was quickly

```
restored to a respectful position of prominence as it was to play
an integral role in combating this new danger.
During the winter of 1807-08, Sir James Craig, the captain
```

### general and governor-in-chief of British North America,

```
developed a policy for the frontier which was to guide the
conduct of the British Indian Department for the next three
hectic years. Craig reasoned that in the event of a war, the
Indians would not be idle, and if the British did not use them,
they undoubtedly would be "employed against us."13 Therefore,
```

### the Indians must be conciliated, but their chiefs must be

### persuaded not to engage in a premature attack on the

Americans. Thus, cautioned Craig, the officers of the Indian  
Department should avoid making any commitment with them  
at least in public. In a dispatch to a worried Francis Gore, the  
lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, Craig noted the "long  
lasting ties" between the King and the tribes, and suggested

1964).

```
that provisions be supplied to the Indians to enable them to
```

### protect themselves against the Americans who "obviously

```
desired to take their country."14 Craig ordered that "the officers
```

### of the Indian Department must be diligent and active, the

```
communications must be constant, these topics must be held up
to them not merely in Great Councils and public assemblies,
they should be privately urged to some of their leading men,
```

### with whom endeavours should be used to lead them to a

confidence with us."  
The dual Indian policy of Craig, one public and one private,  
was very reminiscent of the immediate post-1783 efforts. As  
before, the British Indian Department was to renew the old  
courtship rituals, and secure Indian loyalty to the King, and  
thus preserve British imperial and territorial jurisdiction in  
Upper Canada by confounding the expansionist ambitions of the  
United States. Gore was enthusiastic about the plan and sent  
William Claus, the deputy superintendent general of Indian  
Affairs, to the British post at Amherstburg, the key Indian  
center in the province, where he was to assemble the chiefs,  
"consult privately" with them and remind them of the "Artful  
and Clandestine manner, in which the Americans have obtained  
possession of their lands, and of their obvious intention of  
ultimately possessing themselves of the whole and driving the  
Indians out of the Country."16 However, the officers of the  
department were reminded to dissuade the tribes from any  
warlike action until or unless Britian should be at war with the

### United States.

```
In the spring of 1808 several Indian bands began to assemble
at Amherstburg to hear the British speak in council. For the
```

### officers of the Indian Department, the implementation of

### Craig's policy required delicate and intricate negotiations,

### particularly since "the Indian Nations owing to the long

```
continuance of Peace have been neglected by us, and from the
considerable curtailments made in the Presents to those People
it appears, that the retaining of their attachment to the King's

Interests has not of late years been thought an object worthy of
```

### serious consideration."17 As a consequence, William Claus,

Matthew Elliott and others, worked diligently to regain the  
affections of the Indians. In one council, a Shawnee contingent  
under Captain Johnny, Blackbeard, and the Buffalo, was told

### that the King was trying to maintain peace with the

```
Americans, but if he failed, the Indians could expect to hear
from the British and together they would regain the country
taken from them by the Americans. Heartened by this news,
Indian warriors and chiefs, including the influential Shawnee
leader Tecumseh who, like Pontiac and Joseph Brant before
```

### him, dreamed of a united Indian confederacy, gathered in

```
increasing numbers at Amherstburg to meet with the British.
Although the innocuous public councils were conducted with
great decorum, formality, and military pomp, the private
communications with select chiefs (the backroom politics of the
```

### day) were where the real strategy was formulated and

### entrenched. Yet, in spite of the different Indian Nations

collecting on the Wabash to preserve their country from any  
encroachments, the tribes remained somewhat wary of promised  
British support. In fact, Major-General Isaac Brock noted that  
"before we can expect an active co-operation on the part of the  
Indians the reduction of Detroit and Michilimackinac must  
convince that people, who conceive themselves to have been  
sacrificed in 1794, to our policy, that we are earnestly engaged  
in the war."18 In spite of these justifiable Indian concerns, the  
efforts of the British Indian Department in renewing the chain  
of friendship at Amherstburg was an unqualified success.  
For the next two years tribal delegates constantly visited the  
British at Amherstburg to pledge their support to the King and  
to receive gifts and provisions in return. The department,  
receiving no instructions to the contrary, continued to win and  
maintain the allegiance of the various tribes. By the summer of  
1810, Indian frustration and anger at American encroachments

### on their lands and British Indian Department inspiration,

combined to make the Indian appetite for war increasingly

difficult to control. In July, a Sauk and Fox delegation arrived  
at Amherstburg and requested clothing, kettles, muskets, shot,  
and powder. In council, Elliott urged the Indians to "keep your  
eyes fixed on me; my tomahawk is now up; be you ready, but do  
not strike until I give the signal."19 This speech exhilarated the  
tribes who were now most enthusiastic about the prospects of a

### new British-Indian alliance against the common enemy. In

### November, 2,000 Shawnee, Sauk, Winnebago, Ottawa, and

### Potawatomi gathered at Amherstburg for a grand council.

Tecumseh acted as spokesman for the tribes and informed the
British that "we are now determined to defend it [their land]
ourselves, and after raising you on your feet leave you behind
but expecting you will push forward towards us what may be
necessary to supply our wants."
The officers of the British Indian Department were astounded

council had placed the British in a difficult and embarrassing
position. The policy of 1808 had been too successful. Now the
great problem for the department was to prevent the over
zealous Indians from attacking the Americans before the official

States. In a desperate attempt to reverse policy, the department  
was instructed to dissuade the tribes from their projected plan  
of hostility. The chiefs were to understand clearly that they  
"must not expect any assistance" from the British.22 By the  
summer of 1811 the officers of the Indian Department were  
striving frantically to stall the Indian war by attempting to  
convince various influential chiefs that the time was not ripe.  
But the Indians' desire for war was unshakable and sporadic  
raids commenced against the American settlements along the  
Wabash River. The Americans deduced that British intrigue

and instigation was behind the revival of Indian resistance and
```

### Indian-American and Anglo-American relations rapidly

deteriorated. Following the battle of Tippecanoe on 7 November  
1811 in which "British muskets were found on the battlefield,"  
the Americans charged that "the whole of the Indians on this  
frontier have been completely armed and equipped out of the  
king's stores" at Amherstburg.23 A war between the Indians,  
Americans and British now appeared certain.  
For several months, prior to Tippecanoe, the British Indian  
Department had made genuine efforts to prevent an Indian war,

## but the vacillation of policy and the long delays in

```
communicating often different instructions had hampered the
effectiveness of the department and confused the visiting chiefs.
```

### The only alternative was the renewal of the traditional

```
friendship and military alliance as revived in 1808. Therefore,
throughout the spring of 1812, following the latest instructions
of using "your utmost endeavours to promote His Majesty's
Indian Interest in general," the British Indian Department
secretly prepared the tribes for war.24 By June of 1812 when the
```

### United States finally declared war on Great Britain and

### proceeded to invade Upper Canada, the British Indian

### Department, probably relieved at receiving the news, was

### waiting at Amherstburg with an impatient host of Indian

warriors for the commencement of military action.  
Nowhere was the success of the long-standing and evolving  
British Indian policy better demonstrated than during the War  
of 1812. From the moment hostilities commenced, the fighting  
efforts of His Majesty's Indian Allies were generally successful,  
particularly during the first few critical summer months of  
1812, as evidenced by a series of Indian inspired victories at  
such places as Michilimackinac and along the Detroit River at  
Brownston, Maguaga (Monguagon) and Detroit.25 The Native  
leaders came from many tribes and regions of the Great Lakes.

41st Regiment of Foot (later the Welch Regiment), physically
exhausted after fourteen months of almost continuous and
arduous campaigning against much superior forces, at least in
numbers, uncharacteristically broke ranks after firing two
ragged volleys, and surrendered or dispersed.30 His Majesty's
Indian Allies, positioned in the swamps and woods to the right
of the British position, continued to contest the battle for a
time, before stubbornly, but in good order, giving way. Tecumseh
was slain; and with him ended the dream of a united Indian
resistance against the territorial ambitions of the United States
in the lower Great Lakes region.

along the Detroit front, following the Battle of the Thames,  
what ended in one area, had just begun in another. This second  
front? the Northwest? merits some considerable attention,

known, and which could have altered dramatically the future
geographic boundaries of Canada and the United States. Again,
His Majesty's Indian Allies were prominent.
British paramountcy in the upper Mississippi and the North
west depended on the military allegiance of the Indian tribes of
that vast region. The British and Indian capture of Michilimac
kinac; and the Potawatomi massacre of Fort Dearborn (Chicago)
in the summer of 1812 had "opened the northern hive" of In
dians against the Americans.32 Equally important, the zealous
activities of the officers of the British Indian Department and
several prominent Canadian fur traders in courting and main
taining the alliance with the tribes had resulted in a "British"
domination in the Northwest which remained unchallenged
until the late spring of 1814.
In May of that year, an American force from St. Louis under
General William Clark, governor of Missouri Territory, ascended
the Mississippi and, meeting only token resistance from the
Sauk and Fox, took possession of Prairie du Chien. After con
structing a stockade which he named Fort Shelby and content
with his success, Clark returned to St. Louis. He left a small
garrison of about seventy men under Lieutenant Joseph Per

village and the new post. The news of the American presence in

quence and which brought him into the very heart of that oc  
cupied by our friendly Indians." Although his own position was  
weak, McDouall was fully cognizant of the critical threat posed

### by the Americans at Prairie du Chien to British military

hegemony and Canadian fur trade interests in the Northwest. If  
the enemy was not removed from the area "there was an end to  
our connection with the Indians... tribe after tribe would be  
graned \[sic\] over or subdued, and thus would be destroyed the  
only barrier which protects the Great trading establishments of  
the North West and the Hudson's Bay Company."  
In late June, an expedition under Lt. Col. William McKay  
was dispatched to Prairie du Chien. They were joined en route  
by voyageurs, Green Bay militia, and a horde of Indians. McKay

### was singularly unimpressed with the tribal allies and com

mented upon his arrival in front of Fort Shelby that his contin  
gent had swelled to 650 men, of whom 120 were Canadian Vol  
unteers, Michigan Fencibles, and officers of the Indian Depart  
ment, the remainder Indians who proved to be "perfectly use  
less."35 The small American fort containing two blockhouses  
and six pieces of cannon was situated on a hill overlooking the  
village. A large gunboat, the Governor Clark, was anchored in  
the middle of the Mississippi River. This floating blockhouse,  
immune from the effects of musket fire, mounted fourteen can  
non and had a crew of eighty men. It was constructed so that  
the men on board could row swiftly in any direction. The unex  
pected appearance of McKay and his mixed force on Sunday, 17  
July, caught the Americans by surprise. It was a pleasant day  
and the officers were preparing to take a pleasure ride and  
enjoy an outing in the country. After a dramatic exchange of  
notes, Perkins concluded by stating that he preferred to defend  
to the last man rather than surrender. This produced a three  
hour barrage against the fort and gunboat. The Americans re  
turned the fire. The Governor Clark, leaking and taking casual  
ties, withdrew down river. For the next two days McKay con

ducted siege operations. Two breastworks were constructed, and  
"a constant but perfectly useless" musket fire was maintained  
against the fort. Some of the Indians "behaved in a most villan  
ous manner" and plundered the inhabitants in the village. On  
19 July, McKay "resolved to accomplish something more deci  
sive," and marched his troops into the recently completed works  
and prepared red hot shot for the cannon. The Americans, see  
ing "that a severe assault of some kind was about to be made,  
raised the white flag." By the terms of the capitulation, McKay  
took possession of the fort, several pieces of cannon, military  
and camp equipment, and a large quantity of ammunition and  
foodstuffs. The surrendered garrison was permitted to retire un  
molested in boats down river to St. Louis. McKay was pleased  
with the Michigan Fencibles who "behaved with great courage,  
coolness and regularity," and "tho in the midst of a hot fire not  
a man was even wounded." Indeed, purred McKay, "all acted  
with that courage and activity so becoming Canadian Militia or  
Volunteers."  
Two days after the success at Fort Shelby, the Indians, whose  
military prowess had been so recently maligned by McKay, won  
a crushing victory over the Americans at Rock Island rapids, a  
few miles south of Prairie du Chien. This American force of  
about 120 regulars and rangers under the command of Major  
John Campbell, and unaware of the recent developments, was

Shelby. Near the Indian villages scattered along the banks of
the Rock River, about 400 Sauk, Fox and Kickapoo attacked and
severely mauled the relief column. The Indians fought with a
fierce intensity and, desperate to protect their villages and
property, "the women even jumped on board with hoes and some
breaking heads, others breaking casks, some trying to cut holes

decks."37 About fifty Americans were killed and wounded in the
engagement. Joined by the timely arrival of the Governor
Clark, Campbell and his remnant made a precipitate retreat to
St. Louis. A jubilant McKay reported that "this is perhaps one
of the most brilliant actions fought by Indians only since the
commencement of the war."

### Rapids in July, coupled with the successful defense of

Michilimackinac in August, reasserted and confirmed British  
superiority in the Northwest. In the Upper Mississippi, McKay  
crowned his success in a symbolic sense by modestly renaming  
Fort Shelby, Fort McKay. He then promptly retired to his quar

head" and "a violent fever." In fact he was suffering from a se

His successor at Fort McKay was Captain Thomas Gummer
sall (Tige) Anderson, the commander of the Mississippi Volun
teers. As post commandant, Anderson strengthened Fort McKay
and built a northeast blockhouse. He worried about the poor
harvest that year, and because of the want of provisions, he or
dered the Mississippi Volunteers to help the local farmers in
getting in the grain. The troops were also kept occupied per
forming daily garrison duties. There were few diversions, except
for excessive rum drinking and watching the occasional exciting
spectacle of inter-tribal lacrosse in which several participants
usually "got sore wounds from the ball and the hurl stick."

villages and corn fields, and of pushing north to Prairie du  
Chien.40 With the Indians in pursuit for nearly three miles, the  
Americans retreated down river. They had suffered about fifteen  
killed and wounded. Indian casualties were considered negligi  
ble. At the entrance of the Des Moines River, Taylor built Fort  
Johnson. In October, this last vestige of an American presence  
in the upper Mississippi was burned, and the garrison retired to  
St. Louis. No further military efforts were made against Rock  
Island or Prairie du Chien.  
By the late autumn at Fort McKay, rations were becoming  
scarce. To alleviate the food shortage, Anderson discharged the  
Green Bay militia and sent them home. The remaining troops  
received corn one day, flour and pork the next. Of greater con  
cern was the increasing number of Indian families who were  
camping around Prairie du Chien awaiting the arrival of the  
annual supplies from the Indian Department. These problems  
remained unsolved when Anderson was finally relieved of his  
temporary command on 30 November 1814. His dedication and  
abilities were proven, and he remained at Fort McKay in local  
command of the .Michigan Fencibles. Andrew Bulger, a New  
foundlander, took command of Fort McKay on this last day of  
November, his twenty-fifth birthday.41 The situation was both  
dangerous and delicate as the new commandant had inherited  
the twin problems of garrison discontent and tribal irritation at  
the scarcity of provisions. The troops were bored and insolent.  
They were now existing mainly on a scanty allowance of bread  
and a ration of "wild meat" when available. Determined to pre  
serve order, Bulger began to instill a sense of pride and discip  
line in his men. This goal was achieved in early January 1815,

### when he quickly suppressed a near mutiny among the

Michigan Fencibles and flogged the three worst offenders.  
Thereafter the corps assumed a more steadfast military bear  
ing.

In addition, Bulger was instructed to "cultivate a good under  
standing" with the Indian tribes and maintain their allegiance  
to the British. Throughout the winter of 1814-15, his duties  
were "as unceasing as they were arduous," and he succeeded in  
gaining the continued affection of the Indians by visiting sev  
eral of their villages.43 Unfortunately he also became embroiled  
in a bitter feud with Robert Dickson, Agent and Superintendent  
to the Western Indians, over the control and feeding of the In  
dian allies. Dickson had been prominent in the fur trade for  
thirty years before the war, and he was the senior officer of the  
British Indian Department in the Northwest. He was married  
to a Sioux woman and was genuinely concerned at the destitute  
condition of the Indians, apart from their military value. Rela  
tions between the two men became increasingly strained over  
specific areas of responsibility. Dickson insisted that supplies to  
the Indians must be increased and he showed a bias in feeding  
the Sioux bands. Bulger endeavored "to promote a fair, equal  
and judicious distribution" of provisions and gifts to the Indian  
families, and he refused to allow the Indian Department to  
usurp his authority or that of the British army.44 He reported to  
McDouall that the conduct of Dickson had placed the garrison  
and other western Indian allies in danger of further starvation.  
The feud became petty and degenerated into name-calling.  
McDouall fully supported Bulger, and in one letter he referred  
to Dickson as that "insidious, intriguing, dangerous, yet despic

### able character."45 This nastiness was terminated when

McDouall finally ordered that "the Indian Department on the  
Mississippi is subject to and entirely under the orders of Cap

### tain Bulger."46 In April 1815 Dickson was ordered to

Michilimackinac. This whole episode, coupled with the boredom  
and isolation of Prairie du Chien, so disgusted Duncan Graham  
that "was there not favourable appearances to the termination  
of this drudgery," he reckoned that "he would throw up in  
stantly." The disconsolate Graham proved prophetic when he

Here we are posted since last fall, without news from any

In fact official news of peace reached Prairie du Chien in the  
late spring of 1815. Strong war-parties to threaten St. Louis,  
and "keep the Americans at home to defend that place" had al  
ready been dispatched. In these raids the Indians "took more  
scalps within the last six weeks than they did during the whole  
of the preceding spring and summer upon this frontier."48

McDouall was "penetrated with grief at the restoration of this

pation of Prairie du Chien, was that all three post commanders  
and most of the garrison, were Canadians.50  
In the Northwest, the War of 1812 was a very different matter  
than the one played out along the Detroit. When the United  
States went to war in June 1812 to redress national honor and  
capture Canada, an early territorial ambition which anticipated  
the American vision of manifest destiny for the continent, the  
key consideration for Upper Canada was defense. The concept of  
'Manifest Destiny,' replete with spiritual and religious connota  
tions, was used by the United States to justify that westward  
sweeping movement in which successive Indian frontiers were

### conquered and pacified. It was God's will, apparently, that

Americans must dominate and control North America. The sug  
gestion that the United States usurped a large part of the conti  
nent by purchase, war and theft, is too harsh. But, an argument

### could be made that the zealous young republic dispossessed

tribe after tribe during the long epic years of 'Westward Ho;'  
and it did so by taking thousands upon thousands of hectares or  
acres of unceded Indian lands, to which no consideration, recog  
nition nor acknowledgement was given that these indigenous  
peoples might have at least the benefit of the right of prior oc  
cupancy or aboriginal title, as they had enjoyed the use and oc  
cupancy of their lands since time immemorial.  
Manifest Destiny proved most successful for the expansionist  
ambitions of the United States, except, of course, in the case of  
Canada during the War of 1812. The failure to take Canada was  
a rare exception through these many years in which American  
destiny did not manifest. Yet Americans were mollified, for they  
did win the Indian war in the War of 1812, as Tecumseh's Con  
federacy was irretrievably crushed and the Great Lakes Indian  
frontier secured. But the War of 1812 also provided the pros  
pects for a little Canadian manifest destiny. In the Northwest, a  
number of prominent Canadian fur traders, supported by the  
Indian tribes of the upper Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley,  
also viewed, in their way, the War of 1812 as an opportunity to  
grasp and consolidate territory. For these two groups, the war  
became a common struggle to achieve a possible permanent  
British hegemony in that hinterland and thus preserve the fur  
trade and the traditional Indian way of life against American

rificed Indian and Canadian ambitions in the Northwest for a

The post-1815 years indeed produced an "Era of Good Feel
ings" between Britain, Canada and America, and a number of
councils took place at Fort McKay, Amherstburg, Drummond Is
land and other Indian Department posts in which British offi
cials "distinctly and explicitly" informed the assembled war
riors that His Majesty's government would no longer assist nor
countenance the tribes in any hostile actions against the United

### States. Further, the warriors were counseled to bury the

### hatchet, plant corn and be content. "I rubbed my eyes and

cleared my ears, before I could believe what I saw or heard"  
commented the die-hard Black Hawk.51 His response typified  
the reaction of Native peoples throughout the Northwest. Cer  
tainly, a dramatic and permanent shift in British Indian policy  
was unfolding. Indeed, the old glorious days of military "pomp  
and ceremony" were irretrievably lost. In a few years new strat  
egy would evolve to civilize and Christianize the Native peoples  
residing in Canada, by "collecting them in villages (reserves),"  
and inducing them to cultivate the land. As well, education and  
religious instruction would be provided for the Indian children,

### along with general medical expenses.52 Thus was born in

Canada the paternal reserve system, and the once proud and
defiant warriors were reduced to "Wards" of the state? from
"Warriors to Wards." For the Native peoples, hoes, seeds, and
bibles had replaced shot, powder, and muskets.
Throughout the long period of British-Indian military al
liances, the Native peoples had been caught in the grip of two
forces, an empire and a frontier, neither of which was particu
larly distinguished for mercy, and both of which were eventu
ally destined to resolve their differences by other methods than
costly Indian wars. Repeatedly during these critical years for

### tached themselves to the British in each fight against the

Americans, as the Native peoples tried to salvage some remnants  
of their traditional lands and cultural values, as the original  
people. In the War of 1812, the warriors lashed out in one final  
desperate defense of the old order. But, from the beginning of  
contact, Native peoples in America and Canada could only delay  
or retard, but not stem, the tide of these technologically dominant  
and ever intruding newcomers. The Indian struggle was made  
even more difficult by rampant tribal factionalism which (then as  
now) broke the spirit of Indian unity and harmony; and made the  
pretense of the existence of an Indian state or homeland, the  
merest of fictions. A final deathblow for Indian interests was that  
in the grand theater of international diplomacy, Native peoples  
were considered expendable. By the end of the War of 1812, His  
Majesty's Indian Allies were no longer needed nor desired by the

affection and loyalty to the British Crown. This continued
attachment stemmed in part from periodic bouts of British fairness

Proclamation of 1763 in which the crown established a formal
procedure for purchasing the Indian interest in their traditional
lands; and to the fact that the warriors and British soldiers had
fought side by side over many years, as friends and comrades-in
arms. Yet, during a lengthy summer council in 1818, a sage old
chief rose and addressed the assembled. He knew full well that
all was lost for his generation, and concluded the speech to British
Crown officials with a simple truth:
