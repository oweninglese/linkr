## Context\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Context")\]

_Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks_ depicts a supposedly historical tableau, set in 1676, and based on the legend of [Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossack "Cossack") sending an insulting reply to an ultimatum from the [Sultan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan "Sultan") of the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), [Mehmed IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_IV "Mehmed IV").

According to the (unsubstantiated) story, the [Zaporozhian Cossacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaporozhian_Cossacks "Zaporozhian Cossacks") (from "beyond the rapids", Ukrainian: _za porohamy_), inhabiting the lands around the lower [Dnieper River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper_River "Dnieper River") in [Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine "Ukraine")) had defeated [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") forces in battle. However, Mehmed demanded that the Cossacks submit to Ottoman rule. The Cossacks, led by [Ivan Sirko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Sirko "Ivan Sirko"), replied in a characteristic manner: they wrote a letter, replete with insults and profanities. The painting exhibits the Cossacks' pleasure at striving to come up with ever more base vulgarities.

> Sultan Mehmed IV to the Zaporozhian Cossacks: As the Sultan; son of Muhammad; brother of the sun and moon; grandson and viceroy of God; ruler of the kingdoms of Macedonia, Babylon, Jerusalem, Upper and Lower Egypt; emperor of emperors; sovereign of sovereigns; extraordinary knight, never defeated; steadfast guardian of the tomb of Jesus Christ; trustee chosen by God Himself; the hope and comfort of Muslims; confounder and great defender of Christians – I command you, the Zaporogian Cossacks, to submit to me voluntarily and without any resistance, and to desist from troubling me with your attacks.
> 
> — Turkish Sultan Mehmed IV

The Cossacks' reply came as a stream of invective and vulgar rhymes:

> Zaporozhian Cossacks to the Turkish Sultan!
> 
> O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devil's kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. What the devil kind of knight are thou, that canst not slay a hedgehog with your naked arse? The devil shits, and your army eats. Thou shalt not, thou son of a whore, make subjects of Christian sons. We have no fear of your army; by land and by sea we will battle with thee. Fuck thy mother.
> 
> Thou Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, pig of Armenia, [Podolian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podolia "Podolia") thief, [catamite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catamite "Catamite") of Tartary, hangman of [Kamyanets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamenets-Podolsky "Kamenets-Podolsky"), and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and the crick in our dick. Pig's snout, mare's arse, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow. Screw thine own mother!
> 
> So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You won't even be herding pigs for the Christians. Now we'll conclude, for we don't know the date and don't own a calendar; the moon's in the sky, the year with the Lord. The day's the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our arse!

In the 19th century, the historical Zaporozhian Cossacks were sometimes the subject of picturesque tales demonstrating admiration of their primitive vitality and contemptuous disregard for authority (in marked contrast to the more civilized subjects of the authoritarian Russian state).[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks#cite_note-Lang-2) Whether the incident portrayed actually happened or is a just another of these tales is not known, but no concrete or reliable evidence exists that it did happen,[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks#cite_note-Lang-2) although the question remains disputed.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks#cite_note-Infoukes-3)

[Nikolai Gogol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol "Nikolai Gogol")'s 1842 [romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_nationalism "Romantic nationalism")\-[historical novella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_fiction "Historical fiction") _[Taras Bulba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taras_Bulba "Taras Bulba")_ describes the incident in passing. Repin associated with [Savva Mamontov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savva_Mamontov "Savva Mamontov") and his artistic circle and probably heard the story there; at any rate, Repin made his first sketches for the painting in Mamontov's home.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks#cite_note-Lang-2)

While working on the original version, [Repin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Repin "Ilya Repin") in 1889 began work on a second version. This work remained unfinished. The artist tried to make the second version of _The Cossacks_ more "historically authentic". In 1932 it was transferred by the [Tretyakov Gallery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tretyakov_Gallery "Tretyakov Gallery") to the [M. F. Sumtsov Kharkiv Historical Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._F._Sumtsov_Kharkiv_Historical_Museum "M. F. Sumtsov Kharkiv Historical Museum"). In 1935, it was moved to the [Kharkiv Art Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kharkiv_Art_Museum&action=edit&redlink=1 "Kharkiv Art Museum (page does not exist)") \[[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A5%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%85%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B6%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B9 "ru:Харьковский художественный музей"); [fr](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_d%27art_de_Kharkov "fr:Musée d'art de Kharkov"); [de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunstmuseum_Charkiw "de:Kunstmuseum Charkiw")\], where it is now stored. This canvas is slightly smaller than the original version.

The historian [Dmytro Yavornytsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmytro_Yavornytsky "Dmytro Yavornytsky") assisted Repin in portraying the scene authentically.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks#cite_note-Infoukes-3) [Vladimir Gilyarovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Gilyarovsky "Vladimir Gilyarovsky"), a popular journalist of partial Cossack descent, was said to be one of the models who posed for Repin. This, however, turned out to be a falsehood.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks#cite_note-4)
