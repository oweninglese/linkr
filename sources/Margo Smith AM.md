[image 1: margo_smith (link #2)][1]Dr. Margo Smith, Director of the Kluge-Ruhe 
Aboriginal Art Collection[3] at the University of Virginia has been awarded the 
Order of Australia for her work promoting Aboriginal art and culture in the 
United States of America.
 
Wow!
 
The first thing to recognize is that very few people who are not Australian 
citizens have been awarded the AM. Even fewer if you weed out peers and 
cricketeers. Other Americans with whom Margo shares the honor include Admiral 
Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and 
internationally beloved comedian Jerry Lewis. Pretty elite company, wouldn’t you
say?
 
But considerations of citizenship aside, Margo richly deserves this honor. The 
Kluge-Ruhe not only contains one of the largest collections of Indigenous 
Australian art outside of Australia, it is the only museum totally dedicated to 
that art in the Americas. From its origins in the late 1990s as an outpost on 
the fringes of the University and south of the US capital of Washington, DC, the
Kluge-Ruhe has became an international destination for enthusiasts, collectors, 
curators, and artists. It is true, as Rover Thomas taught us, that “roads cross”
and Margo has made her humble quarters on Pantops Mountain, amidst the splendor 
of Virginia’s hills, a crossroads both physical and cultural.

One of the chief reasons for this success is Margo’s genuine Southern 
hospitality, something we prize greatly in this part of the country, and 
something I learned about her early on. We made our first trip to 
Charolottesville to visit the Collection in 2001, just a few years after in 
opened to the public, drawn by the promise of being able to consult the many 
printed volumes and research notes housed in the museum’s study center.
 
At the time I had a pretty insignificant collection of books about Aboriginal 
art of my own and just enough knowledge to understand how big the gaps in my 
education were. And although I was entranced by the variety of the books in the 
museum’s library—some of them well known to me from references in the 
literature, others completely surprising (exhibition catalogs from Japan!)—I 
didn’t spend much time perusing them on that trip. Instead we spend almost the 
entire day in conversation with Margo, hearing about her fieldwork among women 
on the Finke River, her friendship with Howard Morphy, and her travels 
throughout Australia. If Southerners are famous for their hospitality, they are 
equally renowned for their storytelling, and Margo’s gifts are gentle and 
impressive on both accounts.
 
Over the years since then we’ve returned to the Collection many, many times. 
We’ve made the acquaintance of most of our fellow American collectors there. 
We’ve sat down to dinner with anthropologists like Fred Myers, Francoise 
Dussart, Franca Tamisari and Kim Christen[5], not to mention Howard and Frances 
Morphy. (If you’re ever in a position to share a meal with anthropologists, be 
forewarned that they love to discuss other meals, usually consisting of exotic 
foods consumed in equally exotic locations: I suspect it’s a well-honed 
sub-genre of anthropological discourse.) Gallerists en route to or from the 
Kluge-Ruhe, Beverly Knight, Suzanne O’Connell, and Stéphane Jacob, among others,
have detoured to visit us in North Carolina. Margo introduced us to Ron Ramsey, 
recently of the Newcastle Regional Art Gallery, when he was the cultural affairs
attaché in Washington, and to Brian Kennedy shortly after his arrival in the US 
from the National Gallery of Australia. I even had the chance to sit down once 
with the eponymous Mr. John Kluge[6] himself (below), and his wife Tussi.

Many of our first introductions to famous artists likewise came at Margo’s 
hands: Fiona Foley lectured, and presented us with an autographed copy of her 
monograph Solitaire. Rosella Namok, Fiona Omeenyo, Samantha Hobson, and Silas 
Hobson from Lockhart River shared their stories with us. We spend fascinating 
days with Terry Yumbulul from Elcho Island, learning the history of the Memorial
that his father raised there in the 1950s, the subject of Ronald Berndt’s 1962 
study, An Adjustment Movement in Arnhem Land. Juno Gemes came to visit with her 
husband, the brilliant Australian poet Robert Adamson. Alick Tipoti performed 
traditional Torres Strait Islander dances on the lawn out behind the museum on a
cloudless June day. We met up once at Washington, DC’s Kennedy Center for the 
Performing Arts, where Margo introduced me to Stephen Page and members of the 
Bangarra dance troupe.[image 4: margo-alick-tipoti (link #10)][9]
 
In recent years, Margo has secured funding to bring artists over to the 
Kluge-Ruhe for residencies, and the town has turned out to meet Judy Watson[11],
Reko Rennie[12], Vernon Ah Kee[13], Yhonnie Scarce[14], and Ricky Maynard[15]. 
In just a few weeks, Tony Albert will be visiting to open an exhibition of his 
award-winning photographic series, Brothers. Margo has also organized traveling 
exhibitions from the collection since its inception, beginning with Dreaming in 
Color: Aboriginal Art from Balgo, which toured the world for the better part of 
a decade. Another early ambassadorial activity was the publication of Art from 
the Land: Dialogues with the Kluge-Ruhe Collection of Australian Aboriginal 
Art[16], which Margo co-edited with Howard Morphy in 1999. The list of 
contributors to that volume reads like a Who’s Who of Indigenous art 
scholarship: Luke Taylor, Howard Morphy, Djon Mundine, Wally Caruana, Christine 
Watson, Francoise Dussart, and Fred Myers.
 
Margo has kept up a strong program of exhibitions at the Museum itself, too 
numerous to catalog here, although a few deserve special mention: 
Virtuosity[17], curated by Fred Myers, was a standout, as was the solo show 
drawn from the documentary work of photographer Juno Gemes[18]. Regular lectures
for the local community and the Friends of the Kluge-Ruhe always draw good 
crowds. And then there have been truly special events. In 2005 Margo brought to 
Thomas Jefferson’s famed Rotunda at the University of Virginia the symposium 
Media Matters: Representations of the Social in Aboriginal Australia at which 
scholars from around the world to discuss painting, photography, film, dance, 
and radio in an Indigenous Australian context. The panel discussion Sacred or 
Profane? The Australian Government’s Intervention in Aboriginal Communities that
Margo sponsored in 2007 opened many American eyes to the abuses of the Howard 
government and the so-called Northern Territory Emergency Response..
 
In 2006, Margo and Britta Konau, then a curator at Washington’s National Museum 
of Women in the Arts, organized Dreaming Their Way: Australian Aboriginal Women 
Painters[19], an exhibition of over seventy paintings by thirty-three artists 
drawn from public and private galleries and collections in the United States and
Australia. The show was an enormous success and traveled on to the Hood Museum 
at Dartmouth College after closing at NMWA.
 
[image 5: margo-tiwi (link #21)][20]In May and June of 2007, I traveled with 
Margo through twenty-four Aboriginal communities in South Australia, the 
Northern Territory, and Western Australia on a tour organized by Austrade. 
Everywhere we went, coordinators and artists alike greeted Margo warmly. I 
marveled at the ease with which she struck up conversations at each stop, but 
one encounter stood out above all others. When we reached Bula Bula Arts in 
Ramingining, grand master Philip Gudthaykudthay was waiting to present Margo 
with a large canvas that she had earlier commissioned for the Kluge-Ruhe’s 
collection. Margo asked him to explain the design, and Philip, whose English was
extremely limited, borrowed a pen from Margo and proceeded to make an impromptu 
sketch on a sheet of notebook paper as he spoke. When he finished, he rolled up 
the canvas and handed both the painting and the one-of-a-kind ink drawing to 
her.
 
I hope these selected highlights of over a decade’s worth of visits with 
Margo—and there are many more stories I could tell, of dinners, symposia, 
exhibitions, and conversations—serve to demonstrate the depth of Margo’s 
commitment to Aboriginal art, her knowledge of its practitioners and their 
lives, and her genuine love of the culture. In twenty years of work at the 
Kluge-Ruhe and beyond, Margo has never put herself at center stage, but has 
rather allowed the art and the artists to shine and to speak for themselves. She
has always striven to create an understanding of the vitality and the importance
of this art.
 
And so I write today not simply to congratulate Margo on this well-deserved 
honor, but to offer my personal thanks to her for enriching my understanding of 
Aboriginal art, for offering me countless opportunities to learn and appreciate,
for good meals and good conversations and good advice. In truth, all of us who 
love this art are indebted to Margo Smith, AM.
