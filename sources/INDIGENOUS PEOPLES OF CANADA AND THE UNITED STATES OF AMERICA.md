INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA: ENTERING THE 21ST CENTURY
by James S. FRIDERES

I

INTRODUCTION

All around the world, indigenous groups, e.g., Maori of New Zealand, Saami of
Sweden, Ainu of Japan, Indians of North America, are building solidarity over such
issues as sovereignty and self-determination. Their efforts have thus far culminated in
the writing of the Declaration of Indigenous Peoples Rights, which is now before the
United Nations. Even though much of the land base of indigenous peoples has been
lost and much of their political and social structure has been eroded, they have
survived. In fact, many would say that they are experiencing a cultural renaissance.
While indigenous groups recognize that historical events have dulled their claims, they
wish to survive as an ethno-cultural group, maintain their dignity and participate in the
larger social and economic structures of their society. In practical terms this means
they wish to control the use of land, water and natural resources which affect them. Of
equal concern are economic and social policies which impact upon their lives.
Major confrontations between Indians and non-Indians have taken place over the past
three decades as indigenous groups participate in ongoing social and political
activities.1 Issues such as self-government, sovereignty, and Native rights are central
to Indians as they push for political and legal change in the United States and Canada.
Before addressing the current structure of Indian policy in both countries, and how
Indians have positioned themselves as they enter the 21st century, we need to provide
a demographic profile of Indians and a brief history of Indian policy for each country.
This introduction will provide the reader with sufficient background to fully
understand current Indian policy and the political and legal decisions which are taking
place as we head into the 21st century. It will also provide the reader with an
appreciation of the issues confronting Indians.

' There is considerable diversity in the usage of terms to identify the original inhabitants of North
America. Canadians tend to use generic terms such as First Nations, Aboriginals or Natives. More
specific, legal terms are Indians and Metis. On the other hand, Americans do not use these terms and
prefer to use Amerindian or Native American as their "marker" for original inhabitants of the continent.

DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE

2.1

Canada

At the time of sustained contact with Europeans (1500), it is estimated that over
200,000 Indians occupied the land. After four hundred years of colonization, disease,
and poverty, this number was reduced to less than half. However, since the beginning
of the 20th century, a reduction in mortality and an increase in health care have led to
a resurgence of the Indian population. Today the Indian population has increased to
over 500,000 and if broader definitions are employed, the number increases to over
one million (see table 1).
Today, Indians make up four percent of the total population. Their residential patterns
reveal they are dispersed throughout Canada, making up less than one percent of the
total population in the province of Prince Edward Island as compared with over sixty
percent in the Northwest Territories. Forty three percent of Aboriginals live in the
prairie region of Canada while only four percent in the Atlantic provinces. Slightly
more than one fifth of the Indian population resides in Ontario while ten percent are in
Quebec. The remainder live in the northern regions of Canada. These patterns are a
result of both the historical decimation of the Indian population in the East2 and the
forced migration of Indians from East to West as colonization took place.
The original inhabitants represent different legal and social categories.3 For example,
the category Indians is a legal term and individuals entitled to call themselves Indians
must meet historical and legal conditions, e.g., must be a descendent of an Indian,
must have government recognition through birth records, and must not be a
descendent of someone who renounced their Indianness or cannot legally prove their
Indian status.4 Indians are further subdivided into those who may legally live on
reservations (land set aside by the government and held in trust) and those who cannot.
Another subdivision of Aboriginals are those who are legally defined as Metis (the
biological product of Indians and European immigrants).5 These individuals are legally
recognized in the Canadian constitution and by provincial authorities in the provinces
of Alberta and British Columbia. Yet, in other parts of Canada, Metis have no legal or
political standing (Morse & Giokas, 1995). The third subdivision represents northern
residents. Inuit (originally referred to as Eskimos) reside in northern regions of Canada
and have achieved both legal and political recognition. The recent creation of Nunavut
2

Beothuk-Indians in Newfoundland were exterminated by settlers and ceased to exist by the 20th
century.
3
In the present paper we will use the term Indians or Native Americans unless otherwise warranted.
In the current legal literature, Canadian officials refer to Aboriginal as a way of encapsulating diverse
groups such as Metis, Inuit, and Indian; all of which are legal entities.
4
For example, for years section 12,l,b of the Indian Act stated that an Indian woman who married a
non-Indian man would loose her Indian status as would her children. This clause was recently revoked
but only for a select number of living individuals.
5
Other, often derogatory names have been given to these individuals, such as half-breeds.

The Inuit will also be provided substantial sums of money to carry out their own
development plans. The last group identified are those referred to as non-status
Indians. These are individuals who may have all the phenotypical traits of Indians
and/or live like Indians but are not legally registered as Indians.
Over five hundred years of colonization and tutelage have left Indians disorganized,
alienated, powerless and with feelings of self-hatred. Socio-economically, Indians are
the lowest of any ethnic group in Canada. Involvement in the labour force is minimal
with unemployment rates running as high as 85 percent on reserves. The occupational
structure for Indians also reveals important differences from the general Canadian
population. Most Indians work in the primary industries while few are involved in
managerial, professional, technical or even clerical jobs. Government transfer
payments, e.g., social welfare, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, represent
the largest single source of income for Indians. For those in the labour market, few
make the median Canadian salary. In summary, job wise, Indians are un- and underemployed. While Indian education is changing, the current working age population has
minimal education (less than grade nine). Today, perhaps because of the change in

educational policy, the younger cohort is staying in school longer and continuing into
postsecondary education.6 Nevertheless, today we find that fewer than twenty percent
of Indian students finish high school (compared to 75 percent of non-Indians) and an
even smaller number complete some university.
Most aboriginal languages are extinct or near extinction. Data show that the ratio of
home language use to mother tongue for all aboriginal language groups is well below
100. For example, only 71 percent use Ojibway, one of the major languages, as a home
language (Silverman & Nielsen, 1992). The involvement of Indians in the criminal
system is well known and Ducharme (1986) points out that nearly seventy percent of
Indians have been incarcerated in a correctional center at some time before they reach
25 years of age.
After World War II, many Indians began to move to the cities. As a result, nearly forty
percent live in urban areas. For those who remain on the reserves or in rural areas,
living conditions are not unlike those in undeveloped countries. Half the Indian
housing fail to meet basic standards of physical condition, with one third overcrowded and less than half the homes having sewer or water connections.
Infantmortality rates are sixty percent higher than the Canadian average and Indians
live, on average about 20 years less than the average Canadian. The major cause of
death is "accident, poisoning and violence" with the rate per 100,000 population well
over 150 and three times the Canadian rate. The Indian population in Canada is young,
with nearly 40 percent under the age of 15.
The above figures accentuate the need for solving problems facing Indians today.
These data also reveal that a larger number of Indians will enter the labour market
over the next decade - into a labour market that cannot deal with the number now
trying to enter the market. Nevertheless, over the past two decades, Indians have
experienced some improvements in their quality of life. Living conditions and other
measures of "well being" show there have been some improvements, e.g., life
expectancy has increased, median income has increased, infant mortality has
decreased. However, at the same time, we find that the difference between Indians and
the general Canadian population on many of these measures is larger today than a
decade ago (Fleras & Elliott, 1992).
2.2

United States of America

Researchers argue that at the time of first contact with Europeans, the Indian
population in the North American continent was between two and fifteen million
(Stuart, 1987; Stiffarm & Lane, 1992). After three centuries of contact, the population
dropped to less than one eighth of that (Snipp, 1989) although the impact of disease,
wars and settlement varied. As the 20th century emerged, the Indian population in the
6
Prior to the 1960's, most Indians were sent to religious residential schools. Then, in 1960, Indians
were sent to provincially funded public schools. More recently, Indian communities have established
their own schools.

United States had declined to about a quarter of a million. Today Indians make up less
than one percent of the total American population. Moreover, they are thinly dispersed
throughout the states and even in areas of heavy concentration, the Mountain and
Pacific regions, they make up less than three percent of the total population. In Alaska
they only make up fifteen percent of the total state population. Nevertheless they are
the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, increasing 73 percent over the
past five decades. It is a young group, with only eight percent over the age of 60
(compared to 17 percent of the total United States population) and nearly 40 percent
under the age of twenty (compared to nearly 30 percent of the total United States
population). The median age for Natives in 1990 was 26 while for all Americans it
was 33.
In United States vs. Rogers, in 1846 the United States Supreme Court ruled that a
Native American must have some biological heritage linking him or her to the original
inhabitants of North America AND they would have to have some social acceptance
within an Indian community. By the late 1800's, individual tribes were allowed to
devise their own criteria for determining who was an Indian. Nevertheless, Congress
has the final authority to determine who is Native American and they have consistently
used the blood quantum theory. Until the mid sixties, any person with 1/32 Indian
blood could be placed on the Indian roll and considered Indian. However, as the
numbers continued to grow, Congress enacted the 1/4 blood rule to be considered a
legal Indian and eligible for various social and economic programs.8 Intermarriage for
Indians is common and this has added new concerns over defining who is an Indian.
Today, over one third of Indian husbands have non-Indian wives.
Prior to World War II, most American Indians remained on the reservations. However,
by the end of the war, nearly one hundred thousand had moved to urban areas. The
federal governments' relocation program (1953-72), accelerated this process and took
an additional one hundred thousand Indians off the reservations and into cities. In
addition, twice that number moved to urban areas during this time period solely
because they thought they could obtain a better life in the city, e.g., enter the labour
market. By 1980, eleven metropolitan areas across the United States had Indian
populations well over ten thousand (Los Angeles had the largest, with over sixty
thousand). Five additional cities had Indian populations between five and ten
thousand. However, we find that a majority of Indians still live in rural areas.
While over one hundred Indian languages still exist and are used in varying degrees, a
similar number have become extinct or nearly extinct. The continuance of Indian
languages occurs where large numbers of speakers are concentrated in rural areas, e.g.,
Navajo. Employment on reservations is low and unemployment rates are between 25
7
In 1934 it was decided by Congress that anyone defined as an Indian would have to be a descendent
from a legally recognized tribe and living on a reservation or have at least one parent with Native
American bloodline.
8
This policy was successfully challenged in 1985 when the courts ruled that the constitutionality of
the use of the sole blood quantum theory was illegal.

and 36 percent. Their participation in the labour market determines their income and
Indians have median incomes which are about two thirds of that of whites (McLemore,
1991).
Educational attainments of Indians are much lower than those of non-Indians. In 1991
only about one half of all Indians over the age of twenty four had completed high
school compared to over two thirds of non-Indians (McLemore, 1991). Indians are
achieving some control over the content and style of education and the proportion of
Indian children in Bureau of Indian Affairs schools has decreased over time. By 1990,
less than ten percent of Indian children were enrolled in Indian Affairs schools; the
remainder attended nearby public schools. Today, more than 127,000 Indians are
enrolled in colleges across the nation and about nine percent attend one of the twenty
three Indian controlled community colleges (Feagin & Feagin, 1996). While most
Indian colleges are small, poorly financed, and not fully accredited, this represents a
major change over the past two decades. The percentage of Indians completing
university has risen recently to nearly ten percent but when compared with nonIndians, it represents less than half the rate.
As would be expected from the above figures, quality of life for Indians is well below
that achieved by other Americans. Health statistics show that Indians are still more
likely to die early in life and that they live 15 to 20 years less than a non-Indian. And
while infant mortality rates have been reduced substantially (82 down to 11 deaths per
1,000 births), Indians still have a higher rate than the country's average and suffer a
disproportionate number of deaths from causes that reflect their poor quality of life.

NORTH AMERICAN HISTORY AS IT RELATES TO INDIANS

In the period of early contact until mid 18th century, Indians dealt mainly with
European traders who wished to exploit the natural resources of the new world. At the
same time, Catholic missionaries set upon a goal of converting Indians who they felt
were capable of becoming Catholics AND who wanted to be converted. From the
Indians' perspective, they tended to view the Europeans and missionaries as a
nuisance, not a cultural or military threat. By the mid 1750's, the British, declaring war
on the French, needed to stabilize their relationship with the indigenous population. As
such, they created an Indian Department to establish formal relations with the Indians,
protect Indians from traders and control the actions of colonists. After the Treaty of
Paris (1753) was signed, France relinquished all its North American Territories to the
British which opened the borders of Canada and promoted the settlement of lands by
colonists. Many Indians objected to this act, e.g., Pontiac and his followers objected to
the claim of sovereignty by Britain and captured several British forts, but their
technological inferiority (especially in the area of arms and munitions) led to their
eventual defeat.

Nevertheless, to demonstrate their concern over the treatment of Indians, Britain
agreed to establish the Royal Proclamation of 17639. This treaty of peace and alliance
between Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal, ended the Seven Years War10. The
Proclamation is important for Indian people in that it has two provisions which are
directed specifically at them. First, it states that abuses in colonists' purchasing land
from Indians will cease. It explicitly states that colonists are forbidden to purchase
land from Indians where the Crown had permitted Indian settlement. If Indians wanted
to sell their land, they could only do so to the Crown. The second provision states that
land outside the boundaries of Quebec (1763), Ruperts Land, as well as lands located
west of the source of the rivers that flow into the sea from the west and northwest, will
be set aside for Indians. It clearly specifies that land within the area described above
cannot be purchased by colonists without prior authorization by government
authorities (Dupuis & McNeil, 1995).
British rule was disputed by the thirteen colonies and with the conclusion of the
American Revolution (1776), the United States of America was created. By 1791,
Upper and Lower Canada were established although they remained under British
jurisdiction. Indian policy was controlled by the military until 1830, when it was
replaced by a civilian agency. Overall, early Indian policies were bifurcated. At the
global level, diplomacy, deliberations and treaty making were the cornerstones of the
policy. However, at the local level, treaty breaking, intolerance and fraud were the
basis for dealing with Indians (Thompson, 1996).
3.1

The United States of America

The Indian policy of the United States of America emerges out of the British policy
prior to the American Revolution. Thus the Royal Proclamation (1763) forms the
basis of American Indian policy. It is only the lack of clarity in the Proclamation that
allowed the two countries to develop different Indian policies over the past two
centuries. However, like Canada, which created a centralized Indian Affairs agency,
the United States adopted such a bureaucratic structure. Today the Bureau of Indian
Affairs centrally administers all Native American issues. As Brock (1993) points out,
the United States legislation on Indians and Indian issues is complex, comprising over
5,000 federal statutes, 2,000 federal court opinions and nearly 400 ratified treaties and
agreements.
Prior to the creation of the United States of America, the British government generally
ignored Indian rights or Indian claims. Moreover, the small number of Europeans
entering and developing the new country did not concern Indians, since the fur trade
was at its pinnacle during the 1760's and all parties were benefiting from the trade.11
The Royal Proclamation is not a statute but an edict by the British Government.
While parts of the Proclamation were revoked in the Quebec Act of 1774, the Act went on to say
that nothing in the Act was to extend, nullify vary or alter any right, title or possession, however derived
and all rights, titles and possessions were to remain in force as if the Act had not been passed.

Images of Canadianness

As colonization continued, the British unilaterally invoked the Right of Discovery
doctrine, claiming control over all land and people. This doctrine was supported in
1823 with the Supreme court decision (Johnson vs. Mclntosh) which ruled that Indians
did not hold title to their land and thus could not sell it directly to non-Indians.
As the fur trade declined in importance the United States began to see the benefits of
Indians as allies. The tentative and vulnerable status of an emerging nation forced
the Americans to sign treaties with Indians and recognize tribal authority (Brock,
1993). However, treaty signing didn't begin until after the American revolution and
most took place between 1789 and 1871. Throughout the 19th century, immigrants
began to settle and agriculturalize the land previously held by Indians. As the 19th
century ended, no more treaties were signed and Congress began to remove Indians
from their lands. By the early 20th century, much of the Indian land had disappeared,
many Indians had died from wars and disease, and Indians were subjected to
detribalization and assimilation policies (Cornell, 1988).
The result of such a policy was the basis for major Indian wars. As a result of these
wars and diseases, Indians were forced to settle on lands set aside by the federal
government for Indians, i.e., reservations. Nevertheless it was during this period that
the American courts recognized the status of tribes as "domestic dependent nations."13
In the Cherokee Nation vs. Georgia, 1831 ruling, the courts advanced the domestic
dependent nations thesis. This ruling stated that tribes were distinct political entities
which had inherent self-governing rights and were derived from the Indians' original
occupancy of the land. It was a case where a weaker state placed itself under the
protection of a stronger one, all the while remaining a state. One year later the
Worcester vs. Georgia decision further strengthened this ruling. It declared that the
state of Georgia did not have the legislative authority to supersede Cherokee law.
Moreover, it determined that Indian internal powers of self-government were not
restricted by treaties or federal/state acts. As Brock (1993) points out, the only limit
was tribes attempting to engage in international treaties or contracts subject to
Congressional authority. A more recent ruling in the Native American Church vs.
Navajo Tribal Council, 1959, found that Indian tribes are not states, they have a higher
status than that of a state.
Genocide and assimilation were the thrusts of all federal policy directives employed in
the late 19th and early 20th century. Several strategies were employed to achieve these
goals. First, the communal basis of Indian land tenure was removed and fee simple
was given to many individual Indians. The Allotment Act (1887) gave individual
Indians the right to own land and dispose of it. It struck at the heart of the Indian
to control the fur trade.
12
Indian Affairs was placed under the direction of the War Department in 1789.
13
It is important to remember that the legal doctrine of tribal sovereignty and the legal definition of
the relationship between the federal government and tribal governments are applicable ONLY to Indians
living within recognized communities, e.g., living on reservations. For example, urban Indians are
excluded from this characterization as are Aleuts and Eskimos living in Alaska.

communal way of life and destroyed the indigenous social organization. Records show
that between 1887 and 1934, 2.75 million hectares (60 percent of the Indian land base)
was sold to white settlers. In addition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs began a major
effort to interfere with the "day to day" operations on the reservations, engaging in
direct management which struck at the very basis of Indian culture. New systems of
government were introduced, the concept of individual rights was made an integral
component of the new reservation and capitalism was unabashedly promoted in the
reservations. It was also at this time (1871) that Congress declared that Indian tribes
were no longer to be defined as "independent" nations. They also decreed that any
powers Indians had were not inherent but delegated by Congress and thus could be
removed at will by Congress. To facilitate this new policy and implement the
provisions, the reservation system was created (1871-87).
This assimilation policy was carried on into the early 20th century. Then in 1934 a
new direction in American Indian policy emerged under the leadership of the new
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier. His new policy was to treat a band or
tribe as a unit of community organization and build upon it. In many ways, Collier was
an early advocate of self-government. Over the next decade, the Bureau of Indian
Affairs developed nearly one hundred tribal governments, all within existing
reservations. However, a new Indian policy was developed after World War II, now
referred to as the termination policy. In 1953 the termination policy was implemented
(lasting until the early 1960's) and thousands of Indians were removed from their rural
communities. The termination of over one hundred reservations took place and the
land ceased to be defined as a reservation; it now could be purchased by non-Indians.
3.2

Canada

As Britain entered the 19th century, it began to develop a new set of policies regarding
Indians. It was clear by this time that Indians were no longer important military allies
and the development of Canada refocused on issues of immigrant settlement and
exploitation of the natural resources, e.g., furs, timber, minerals. As such, policies
were implemented which gave the government the right to establish treaties, transfer
the obligation of Indian integration to religious organizations and vest all Indian lands
in the federal Crown.
By 1867 (Canada Confederation), all the basic features of Canadian Indian Policy
were in place (Armitage, 1995). In 1876 the first comprehensive Indian Act was
established; representing an amalgamation of many prior, disparate Acts relating to
Indians and Indian lands. This new Act established a definition of "Indian"14 as well as
policy with regard to how the Crown would treat Indians (from the boardroom to the
bedroom) and the rights and obligations of Indians, e.g., election of chiefs and
Until recently, the term "Indian" was clearly defined under the Indian Act. It noted that Indian
meant: any person of Indian blood reputed to belong to a particular band, any child or any such person
and, any woman who is or was lawfully married to any such person. Since the 1970's there have been
many changes to this definition although its central thrust remains intact.

councils, taxation rights, sale of Indian land, control of intoxicants, provisions for
becoming a citizen of Canada and voting in federal/provincial elections. However, it is
important to note that at NO time did the federal government act or define Indians as
having nation status or having any inherent rights. During the next fifty years, yearly
amendments were made to the Indian Act. The central thrust of the Indian Act was to
control and assimilate Indians and all actions taken by the Crown were directed toward
that goal. The administration of the Indian Act (since it was placed under civilian
auspices in 1830) was through a superintendent, who had wide discretionary powers
with regard to how to govern and deal with Indian people (created under the British
North America Act, 1867). Today the Minister of Indian Affairs is responsible for
Indians and their land through a large, complex bureaucratic structure consisting of
over 20 departments, 5,200 employees and a yearly budget of over Cdn$6 billion
(Frideres, 1995).
During the second half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century, the
government of Canada dealt with Indians and their lands by entering into treaties with
them. These legal agreements specified the rights and obligations of both parties
although it is unlikely that the Indians fully understood the specific terms or
consequences of the terms within the treaty. These treaties were undertaken because
the British needed to settle large tracts of land quickly and unimpeded. On the other
hand, Indians were forced to sign these treaties due to the devastating impact of
diseases such as smallpox and tuberculosis, the decimation of the buffalo and (in the
United States), the massacre of Indians opposing westward expansion. By the late
1920's, most of Canada had been "treatied out".15
At the end of World War Two, a joint committee of both the Senate and the House of
Commons recommended new guidelines for future Indian Policy which resulted in a
new Indian Act being passed (1951). This new Act included a political voice for Indian
women, more self-government for Indians, easing of enfranchisement regulations,
cooperation with provinces in delivering services to Indians and educational policies
for Indian children. These sweeping changes to the Indian Act reversed the emphasis
on assimilation and moved the policy toward integration into the social, political and
economic mainstream of Canada.
In 1969 the government, wishing to facilitate the integration of Indians into Canadian
society, introduced a White Paper which suggested that Indians no longer be a legal
entity, reservations be dissolved and the Indian Act be done away with. If Indians and
Indian lands no longer existed, there would be no reason to continue the large
bureaucracy and provinces would take over services for Indians.

15
In earlier times, Treaties of Peace and Friendship had been established with Eastern Indians. The
Royal Proclamation of 1763 was a form of treaty. However, it would not be until the mid 1800s that the
major "numbered" treaties were taken with Indians. These treaties ceded most of the land west of
Ontario to the Crown.

Indians objected to the White Paper and a coalition of Aboriginal, religious, and nongovernment organizations along with the provinces, lobbied the federal government to
withdraw the proposed policy. In 1973 a formal withdrawal took place.
It was during this time that Indians began to refocus their efforts on self-government
and sovereignty. Their cause was given a substantial boost when the Supreme Court
ruled in 1973 that Indian rights existed independent of the Crown. While the court did
not identify what these rights were, it was the first time that Indian rights were
declared as existing. Subsequent actions by the federal and provincial governments
have recognized broader Aboriginal rights. The Canadian Constitution Act (1982)
recognizes "the existing Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Aboriginal peoples of
Canada," and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) was qualified so as "not to
abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other right or freedom that
pertained to the aboriginal peoples of Canada..." One year later the House of Commons
Special Committee on Indian Self-Government produced a report calling for an
expansion of self-government so that Natives could be recognized as a distinct order
of government in Canada.

IV

RECENT EVENTS AND NEW DIRECTIONS

We begin this section by identifying some recent events defined as milestones which
would reconfigure Indian-White relations as well as begin the long process of
integrating Indians into the larger society. We wish to identify four issues currently
being negotiated by Indians in their push to achieve greater self-determination and
obtain a better quality of life for themselves and their children.
4.1

Canada

After the demise of the White Paper, there was a concerted drive toward devolution of
Indian affairs from the federal government to Indians. During the late 1970's and early
1980's, many provisions for Indian administration of various programs, e.g.,
education, community, were handed to Indian communities. Indian control over some
programs has had moderate success but since funding remains solely in control of the
federal government, control over the administration of programs seems to be a weak
form of Indian control. There is no question that the federal government has moved to
a less centralized and more flexible funding arrangement and allowed local Indian
communities to take on greater administrative duties. However, after nearly twenty
years of negotiations, it would seem that Indian self-government is nothing more than
a community by community negotiation over powers and jurisdiction that approximate
municipal governments (Fleras & Elliott, 1996).
In the push for Indian self-government, the federal government developed a policy of
community-based self-government. The community-based self-government policy was
announced in 1986 in an attempt to push through Indian development while sidestepping the Indian Act. A decade after its introduction, the Indian Act has been

viewed as a vehicle for providing Indians a measure of self-determination while at the
same time, a major impediment for Indians achieving self-government. In this strategy,
the federal government offers Indian communities the chance to "throw off the yoke of
colonialism" and take on self-determination and develop self-government. When it
was first introduced, many Indian communities viewed the policy as a "make work"
project while others saw it as a community development project. Others saw it as a
way in which the government could off-load its responsibilities to Indians without
providing Indian communities with commensurate power or resources. Today, fewer
than fifty bands have reached the point of submitting a formal proposal to the
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Most Indian leaders view it
like other government policies directed toward Indians: restrictive in nature and
specifying conditions that make it impossible for Indian communities to become less
dependent on government institutions (Ponting, 1991). As Boldt (1994) points out,
these policies are not developing the concept of Indian nationhood but rather new
forms of constraint and dependency.
4.1.1 Economic Development
Recent economic initiatives involving Indians and private enterprise are regional or
local in scope. Perhaps the greatest impetus for involvement of Indians in the labour
market was the passage of the Employment Equity Act (1986). This Act forced
federally-regulated companies, e.g., banks, transportation companies, crown
corporations, and corporations which obtained government contracts with a value of
over Cdn$200,000 to review their employment policies and procedures with regard to
four targeted groups: visible minorities, women, disabled people and Aboriginals. As a
result of this Act, almost two thirds of all "equity" programs involving Indians were
introduced over the past five years.
Sloan & Hill (1995) argue that an increased emphasis on corporate-Indian relations is
also a response to changes in the business environment. Specifically, the changes in
demographic and political realities have forced corporate Canada to rethink its policies
with regard to Indians. For example, in the Northwest Territories, nearly 60 percent of
the population is Aboriginal (Metis, Inuit, Indian). Government sources suggest that
the Aboriginal population will grow by 50 percent in the next twenty-five years, and
these figures suggest a changing customer base and a new profile for the workforce.
Other considerations such as Aboriginal people controlling 20 percent of the land
mass of Canada poses potential problems for developing or transporting natural
resources, e.g., pipelines, utilities. Government policies have also contributed to this
shift in thinking about Aboriginal peoples, e.g., employment equity legislation, human
rights legislation, surface lease agreements, land claims settlements, and selfgovernment are all new programs implemented by the federal government over the
recent past. In some cases, corporate Canada has found linkages with Aboriginal
peoples provides benefits to their operation. Companies dealing with Aboriginal
' For a listing and detailed explanation of various criticisms of this policy, see Ponting (1991).

people have opened new markets, and developed stable, long-term work forces,
especially in the North. This fundamental shift in thinking has not taken place in
corporate America. While Indians have a vision of economic development which is
trimodal (entailing a revitalized traditional economy, a modern industrial base and
government grants), this type of economic development simply will not stand the test
of time nor allow Indian communities to become economically independent.
Moreover, many Indians believe that once political autonomy has been achieved (selfgovernment), Indian communities will become economically independent. Many
Indians argue that with the passage of Bill C-l 15 (Indian Act Amendment on Taxation,
1988) which established the power of band councils to levy taxes on property on
reserves, economic development is not far behind.17 However, reality suggests that this
is not the case and in fact, the causality of the argument is the reverse. Economic
independence produces political independence.
Taxation has also been an economic issue Indians have dealt with for many years.
Indians were exempt from taxation before Confederation and this is codified in the
Indian Act. However, this exemption is limited to property situated on the reserve and
income generated on the reserve. In 1983 the Supreme Court ruled (R. vs. Nowegijick)
that an employer's physical location was the key to determine whether Indian income
was taxable. They ruled that if an Indians' property was to be tax exempt, the
employer had to be on the reserve. Nearly a decade later, it was decided that the
physical location of the employer was not sufficient for determining whether or not
Indian income was tax exempt. In R. vs. Williams (1993), the Supreme Court ruled that
three factors had to be evaluated to determine the tax status: (1) the purpose of the
exemption, (2) the character of the property, and (3) the incidence of taxation on that
property.
While this test is more flexible than the earlier one, it is also less clear and predictable
and does not afford total tax exemption for Indian income. This means, in practical
terms, that even if the Head office of an Indian company is on a reserve, its property
may still be taxable by the Crown. In addition, it is important to note that Indians still
pay taxes. For example, Indians are liable for custom and excise taxes, they pay
hospitalization taxes imposed by provincial governments and they must pay most
federal and provincial taxes when making purchases off the reserve. In summary, after
several Supreme Court cases, it seems there is little judicial support for the claim by
Indians that there is an Indian right to tax exemption.
When Indians have tried to develop businesses which involve the sale of consumptive
goods, e.g., gas, tobacco, the provincial governments have placed limits on the amount
allowed to be purchased by the band tax free. After estimating how much of the goods
would be sold to Indians, any additional amounts purchased by the band would have
provincial taxes applied. Other retail sales on the reserve require that the band pay the
applicable provincial taxes first and then the band applies for a refund of the original
The Indian Taxation Advisory Board was established a year later to assist band councils in setting
up appropriate tax by-laws.

tax paid. Attempts to become economically independent by solely on-reserve
development will fail with some exceptions, e.g., oil and gas rich reserves. If an Indian
community is to become economically viable, there must be sustainability to the
economic developments and linkages to external markets. Indians need to consider an
expanded economic model that will bring both employment and business opportunities
and only through full participation in the mainstream Canadian economy can
economic independence occur.
4.1.2 Land Issues
Peace and Friendship treaties were entered into with Indians in the Maritimes during
the 1700's. By the mid 1800's, land treaties were imposed upon Indians in southern
Ontario. From that time on until 1930, the Canadian government "treatied" with
Indians from Ontario to Alberta and some of the Northwest Territories.
However, Map 1 reveals that most of Yukon, British Columbia, northern Quebec, and
the Northwest Territories were never treatied out. These land claims have been at the
core of the major legal battles that have taken place over the past two decades and
continue to take up time and money of Indians. There are currently 70 land claims
waiting to be settled. In addition, many "specific" claims have yet to be settled. These
are claims about lands taken away from Indians without proper compensation or in
contravention with other conditions of the treaty. Since the Office of Native Claims no
longer exists, Indians are now forced to negotiate a political settlement or take their
case to court. Considerable time, effort and money have been expended by Indian
communities in their attempt to receive compensation or reclaim lands illegally taken
from them.

4.1.3 Self-Government
While Indians have been fighting for self-determination, sovereignty and selfgovernment since the day Europeans landed on Canadian soil, their efforts were not
successful until the landmark decision of the Supreme Court - Calder vs. AttorneyGeneral of British Columbia (1973). This decision affirmed Aboriginal rights and
paved the way for current demands for self-government by Indians. In 1982,
Aboriginal rights were entrenched in the Constitution and gave, for the first time,
formal affirmation and recognition of the existence of Aboriginal and treaty rights.
Indian groups united in their fight with the federal and provincial governments over
self-determination and sovereignty. While little progress was made during a series of
First Ministers' Conferences on Aboriginal Matters (meetings held by the premiers of
all provinces and Territories as well as the Prime Minister and other federal officials
such as the Minister of Indian Affairs, 1982-87), the negotiations were significant on
two fronts. First, they mobilized Indian groups and created a focused "enemy." This
also provided a political and media platform for articulate Indian leaders, allowing
Canadians to see Indians in a very different context than the usual stereotype. Second,
the issue of self-government became a public topic and Canadians were exposed to the
concept, its various meanings and possible strategies for implementation. Canadians
were forced to assess the logic of the argument and how they might implement such a
strategy. Finally, Canadians were exposed to the costs and benefits of such a strategy
and the implications of what it would mean to a united Canada.
By 1987, there was a profound change in the mentality of politicians, courts and
Canadians with regard to Indian self-government. Today discussions taking place
focus on the form it will take, not whether or not it is going to happen. In short, as
Brock (1993) points out, the right to self-government went from being a disputed item
in the early 1970's to an accepted direction of government policy and negotiated
constitutional clauses in 1992.
The creation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has allowed individuals
and groups to approach the courts to challenge government policy. Under the new
Charter, an alternative "backup" exists for groups when the political forces or will of
the Crown has failed them. Each time constitutional stalls have occurred, Indians have
approached the courts to affirm their rights. In the end, political negotiations between
Indians and the government are taking place within a legal arena. Recent court
decisions have been far more liberal in their interpretation of Indian rights than the
political process. Even though court decisions such as Guerin, Simon, Sioui and
Sparrow have confirmed Aboriginal rights, these decisions and others have also
limited the prospect for Aboriginal self-government.18

18
Court decisions are more zero-sum decisions which polarize the adversaries and limit the
alternatives. Political decisions on the other hand allow for compromise and negotiation.

Images of Canadianness

In their quest for self-government, Indians are negotiating with the federal government
at two levels. At the more concrete level, they are requesting the transfer and delivery
of services, ranging from education, health care to more exotic services such as
gambling, from the federal government to their own communities. While many of
these requests form the basis for self-determination, there is a sense of pragmatism
involved in much of the substance within these negotiations; Indian people believe
that they can prosper only if they are able to develop the policies (both economical and
social), administer and deliver the services. As Brock (1993) points out, at the second
level, the rhetoric is more aggressive and idealistic. The nature of discussion between
the federal government and Indians at this level is more abstract and attempts to create
an ethos in which the more specific negotiations take place. Indians feel they were
successful in doing this throughout the debate regarding the repatriation of the
Canadian Constitution (to ensure that Indians were beneficiaries of the Constitution)
and they continue to feel it is an appropriate strategy. As such, Indians are continuing
their demand for special status in the structure of Canada and they use the language of
nationalism to place the issue in context.19
While negotiations over self-government are taking place under several guises,
progress continues to move slowly. Aboriginals have expressed their frustration with
the premises, scope and pace of the negotiations (Hogg & Turpel, 1995). The Royal
Commission on Aboriginal Peoples (1990) was created to address the issue of selfgovernment and make recommendations which were to be taken up by the government
and implemented. Six years later and at a cost of over Cdn$60 million, the
Commission has now tabled its Final Report. The Final Report recommends that
Cdn$35 billion be spent on Aboriginals over the next twenty years, in addition to the
over Cdn$6 billion it spends each year. The specific recommendations range from the
Queen and Parliament issuing a royal proclamation acknowledging mistakes, the
creation of an Aboriginal parliament, creation of an independent tribunal to decide on
land claims, to training ten thousand Aboriginal professionals in the area of health and
social services. The Commission feels that if the more than 440 recommendations
were implemented, the social and economic gap between Aboriginals and nonAboriginals would be reduced by 50 percent in twenty years.
While the recognition of the inherent nature of the right of self-government has been
formally noted by the federal government, it does not answer the question as to what
are the contents of these rights or how these rights will link and integrate with the
political structure of Canadian society. Thus far the courts have been called upon to
make these decisions and they have advanced the case of Aboriginal rights in a rather
multidirected and disjointed manner. A review of the Supreme Court decisions over
the past decade would not allow the reader to make any clear predictions about future
decisions regarding Aboriginal rights.
19
There have been occasions when subgroups of the Indian communities, e.g., women, have taken
issue with the leadership and accused them of being out of touch with the realities of their
constituencies.
20
Hogg & Turpel (1995) argue that the issues of Aboriginal rights and self-government are not

The concept of Aboriginal self-government is not easily reconciled with the existirig
political structure of Canadian society. As Hogg & Turpel (1995) point out, there are
many principles in the present Canadian Constitution which are inconsistent with the
recognition of Aboriginal self-government, the most important being the principle of
exhaustiveness. This principle has divided all jurisdictions between the federal and
provincial governments and leaves no room for Aboriginal government except for
what might be delegated by the other two levels of government. In short, this means
that Aboriginal self-government is much like municipal governments. Nevertheless
some unique agreements for self-government have taken place, e.g., Sechelt Indians,
First Nations of the Yukon. For example, the Sechelt Indians have negotiated a selfgovernment Agreement. The Agreement notes that federal and provincial laws of
general application apply to the Sechelt Indians and their lands. However, in the case
of provincial laws, the laws of the Sechelt Band take precedence. Thus, if there is an
inconsistency between provincial and Sechelt law, Indian law is paramount. However,
when an inconsistency exists between federal and Sechelt law, federal law is
paramount. Hogg & Turpel (1995) point out that the Sechelt Act is silent on the
definition of inconsistency so that the narrow "express contradiction" test would
probably apply.
Thus far in Canada today, the Crown has recognized the right of self-government21 but
has not established any framework by which to implement such a policy. While it is to
be commended that Canadians have accepted the principle of self-government, it does
little to help Indians achieve self-determination. On the other hand, the development
of a formal framework for Aboriginals and its equal application across the more than
2,000 bands and 600 reserves would be nearly impossible. Moreover, this kind of
approach does not take into account the different situations, cultures and aspirations of
Indian peoples living throughout Canada. Hogg & Turpel (1995) suggest that a
"contextual statement" (like that proposed in the failed Charlottetown Accord) be part
of the Aboriginal self-government policy. This idea is that such a statement would
frame self-government jurisdiction in light of the purposes and objectives that were
desired by the specific Aboriginal group seeking self-government.
The contextual statement is based on the premise that Aboriginal government would
be a third level of government, with its own jurisdiction. This model would ensure that
the culture of Indian society (including languages, institutions, traditions) would be
safeguarded and developed while helping Indian people maintain a link with their
environment. Thus, Aboriginal government would have exclusive jurisdiction over
issues identified above and allow them to control their own development. In the end,
they would be able to achieve self-determination on a number of social, economic, and
political dimensions. If this model were adopted by the other two levels of
suitable for resolution by the courts and would better serve all Canadians if they were dealt with through
the political process.
If self-government is inherent, then it would not be contingent upon federal or provincial
recognition. On the other hand, if it is contingent upon governments recognition, then the right is not
based upon the historical use and occupation of Aboriginal peoples over the land in Canada.

government, it would represent a major departure from the status quo and the powers
given to Aboriginal peoples under the Indian Act.
The courts have given some indication that a limited right of self-government is
possible. The Sparrow decision and the courts declaration that decisions about
Aboriginals calls for a liberal and generous interpretation about Aboriginal rights
(Nowegijick) supports this possibility. However, at the same time, the courts have
noted that sovereignty and underlying title to the land remain with the Crown. Over
all, the courts have not dealt with the substantive issue as to whether or not the right of
self-government has been extinguished or still remains.
Both Indians and government agree that self-government expresses the desire of
Indian peoples to control their destiny (Isaac, 1995). Indians feel that they need to
determine their social and economic activities and be accountable to Indian leaders,
not government or agents of the Crown. At the same time, the definition of selfgovernment has been at the heart of the disagreement between Indians and the
government. Governments feel the concept is too broad in meaning while Indians feel
it is too narrow and restrictive (Canada, 1989). Moreover, the form of self-government
is viewed differently by each group. Some Aboriginals want total sovereignty while
others want to achieve some control over their lives but wish to stay within the federal
structure of Canada.
The federal government and provincial officials are slowly trying to convince Indians
that they have moved from a colonial wardship and assimilationist position to one
which is supportive of Indian self-government. However, as Boldt (1994) points out,
this is a partial myth. While there has been some movement in allowing Indians to take
control of their affairs, it is also true that the same government structure remains
(Indian Affairs) as it did in 1876 when the first Indian Act was implemented.
Moreover, the self-government policy has been designed by Indian Affairs personnel,
regulated by government and implemented by politicians. He argues that Indian
special status will disappear, Indian self-government will become municipal
government and institutional assimilation will take over. The wish to do away with
Indian status can be seen in the 1969 White Paper and later the 1985 Nielsen Report.
There is concern that another attempt is underway to do away with the legal status of
Indians but this time under the guise of Indian self-government.
At present, 178 Indian bands have submitted formal proposals to the federal
government to seek some form of self-government. Nearly half of these have
progressed to the "agreement in principle" stage. While ostensibly this new policy is to
serve Indians and help them toward self-determination, the truth may be closer to the
fact that the policy is self-serving and does not provide Indians with the proper tools or
resources to become economically or politically independent. As Boldt (1994) points
out, this shuffle means that the Indians are being asked to deal with local issues on the
reserves but remain under control of the federal agency through a complex set of rules,
conditions and standards with regard to action Indians can take.

Hogg & Turpel (1995) argue that self-government will not take place through
constitutional reform. They argue that it can only take place through a political accord
with the existing two levels of government. A major advantage of such a strategy
would be to reduce the cost and make the process expeditious. Rather than negotiate
separate accords on all the various issues of self-government, a single negotiation
could be signed. This process has successfully been used by the federal, Territorial and
First Nations in the Yukon as they struggle to finalize an Agreement. Notwithstanding
the above "successes," the Government of Canada still denies treaty status to any self.
99
government agreement and this poses a major impediment to this type of solution.
However, some attempts using this model have been successful and in 1995, the
Chiefs of Manitoba and the Minister of Indian Affairs concluded an Agreement which
would dismantle the federal agency within the province and turn over funds and
decision making responsibility to provincial Indian organizations.
There seems to be a concern by government that if Aboriginal self-government is
obtained, the collective rights of Indians will come into conflict with individual rights
of both Indians and non-Indians. Gibbins & Ponting (1986) argue that individual rights
under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the very crux of Canadian
citizenship. Thus, it is felt that individuals will stand to lose under "group"
governments in which individuals have no rights. This has already been demonstrated
when some Canadian bands have sought to thwart Bill C-31 which granted equal
protection under the law to both Indian men and women (Ponting, 1993).
4.2

United States

When the Democrats came to power in the 1960's, they endorsed the notion of
economic development among Native Americans. As Thompson (1996) argues, this
was a time of cultural renewal for Native Americans; new policies of selfdetermination and plans for "partnership self-help" were promoted by senior
government officials. Later the Indian Education Act was passed which allowed
Native Americans to gain control over their schools and the funds given to them by the
federal government. Soon to follow were the American Indian Religious Freedom Act,
the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance Act, the Indian Child Welfare
Act (all in 1978) and finally the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979.
Executive policy and legislative enactments since the 1960's suggest that the United
States government is attempting to change its traditional trustee role. However, the
reader should be cautioned that at the present time, the Bureau of Indian Affairs
continues to exercise considerable influence over Indian affairs in most institutional
contexts, e.g., education, housing, roads. The United States government, like the
Canadian federal government, holds legal title to tribal lands and other major tribal
assets. As such the federal government has considerable fiduciary duty to Indians and
The question is whether or not a self-government agreement that has been denied the status of a
treaty may still be constitutionally protected under section 35 of the Constitution Act (1982) as an
expression of Aboriginal rights.

can be held liable if mismanagement is proven. This trustee doctrine also supports a
broader, non-judicially enforceable obligation accepted by the legislature and the
executive in dealing with Indians. As a result, Anaya et al. (1995) point out, the
Bureau of Indian Affairs increasingly sees its trustee responsibility as developing
Indian self-government and not continuing its paternalistic style of governing.
In 1970 a new policy promoting Native American self-determination was initiated
when the President declared the assimilation policy a failure and called for legislative
measures to ensure Indian self-determination. In 1974 the Indian Financing Act was
established with a budget of Cdn$50 million which would provide loans and grants for
economic development on the reservations. This new policy was further set in motion
by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (1975). The central
thrust of this Act is to allow Native Americans to gain control of the planning and
administration of all federal programs related to them.24 It promotes an orderly transfer
of programs and services from government to Indians. Other federal agencies, e.g.,
Secretary of Interior, Secretary of Health and Human services, now negotiate "selfdetermination contractors" with the tribes so they can plan, conduct and administer
federal programs for the development of Indian resources.
With the 1980 election, a new conservative government was elected. This new
conservative government (lasting until 1992), invoked a "termination by accountants"
policy in which fiscal allocations to Indians were cut substantially. There were some
notable exceptions to this "anti-Indian" government such as the Indian Tribal
Government Tax Status Act (1982), which allowed tribes to enjoy tax exemptions as
many states do. Nevertheless, this conservative government reaffirmed the goal of
reducing Indian dependency on the federal government and pledged to support further
Indian self-determination. The goal was to deal with Indians on a government-togovernment basis.
In 1988 the Indian Self-Determination Act was amended to allow tribes to enter into a
self-government "pact" with the federal government. Under this new agreement,
Indian tribes extended their powers of self-determination to other areas of control,
which until then, had been carried out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian
Health Service. As a result of this amendment, block grants are provided to Indian
tribes and they set the priority of their needs, how programs will be established and
carried out to meet those needs.
Some programs have actually incorporated Native American cultural perspectives into
legislation's, e.g., Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. The Act maximizes tribal
jurisdiction over child placement and limits state intervention in such decisions. The
Indian Health Care Improvement Act was implemented to improve Indian Health and
23
Only recently did the Canadian courts impress upon the Crown that they held a fiduciary duty to
Indians.
24
This Act was recommended by the American Indian Policy Review Commission which had a
number of Indians as members.

encourages maximum participation of Indians in the planning and delivery of those
services. Other acts such as the Indian Religious Freedom Act and the Native
American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act firmly spell out the "special
relationship" between government and Indian tribes.
In 1994, President Clinton met with the leaders of all 547 federally recognized tribes
in the United States. At that time, two executive orders were given. First, he publicly
noted that tribal authorities were to be given the same deference and respect as that
given to state governments. This means that federal officials will have to deal with
tribal officials directly and not shuffle them off to the Department of Interior and the
Bureau of Indian Affairs. Second, he modified the Endangered Species Act which
allows Indians to collect and use Eagle feathers for use in various ceremonies.
Following this meeting, Indian leaders met with the Attorney General and Secretary of
the Interior to discuss ways to strengthen tribes' sovereign status.
4.2.1 Land
In 1946 an Indian Claims Court was created to help Indians achieve a just settlement
for land claims disputes dating back to the turn of the century. During its tenure it
heard 614 cases. Of these, 204 were dismissed as having no merit while the remainder
were decided in favour of Native Americans. In 1978 it was disbanded and the 68
cases still remaining as well as all new cases are now heard by the Court of Claims. In
all cases heard by the Indian Claims Court or the Court of Claims, land has never
given back to the Indians. Successful claims netted nearly Cdn$l billion but little of
this was returned to the claimants. All expenses incurred in the trials had to be first
subtracted and paid to the federal government before payment was made to the Indian
claimant.
Under current constitutional arrangements, if Indians do not accept the decision of the
court, they have to go back to Congress to obtain permission to sue the United States
Government. As one could expect, many cases have yet to be ruled on by Congress.
For example, the Sioux in the Black Hills area of the state of South Dakota claim that
the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 was broken. The case has finally gone through the
courts for which the United States Supreme Court set a figure of Cdn$122 million as
compensation. However the Sioux do not want financial compensation but a return of
the land. The Supreme Court refused to make a judgment requiring the return of the
land, once again forcing the Indians to return to Congress, since only it has the power
to deal with land (see United States vs. Sioux Nations of Indians, 1980).
As the seventies unfolded, land claims became an even more important issue. During
the past two decades major land settlements such as the Alaska claims and the Blue
Lake land claims of the Indians of Taos Pueblo, New Mexico have been settled.
However, other land claims seeking reinstatement of tribal status and compensation
for lost land and damages have yet to be fully dealt with.

4.2.2 Political
Unlike their Canadian counterparts, Native Americans have developed a powerful,
politically active organizational structure.25 The modern day "Red Power" movement
started in 1961 at a Chicago conference which involved influential tribal leaders and a
few radical, young, well educated Indians. Out of this conference was born the
National Indian Youth Council. In 1964 this organization responded to the Supreme
Court of the state of Washington's nullification of eleven federal treaties that had
guaranteed the fishing rights of Indians living in the state. The Youth Council
organized a protest lasting two years and culminating in the US Department of Justice
appearing before the Washington State's Supreme Court on behalf of the Indians.
Flush with such success, other "obstructive" confrontations by Indian organizations
took place such as the occupation of Alcatraz Island (1969). In 1970 the American
Indian Movement was established and quickly developed into a national organization.
Members of this organization assumed militant strategies and began with a protest
march (The Trail of Broken Treaties), the occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
Offices and the occupation of Wounded Knee (1973). It has continued to be a major
political force for Native Americans. One year later, the International Treaty Council
was created and provided a vehicle for taking their issues to the United Nations. In
Canada, the National Indian Brotherhood was a powerful lobbying force during the
1970's but died out by the 1980's. In its place the Assembly of First Nations was
created which is made up of chiefs from all of the bands in Canada. Since then, the
emergence of splinter groups from within, such as legal and non-legal Indians, have
reduced the effectiveness of this Canadian organization.
The goal of these organizations has been to regain their land base and have their
collective rights as nations acknowledged. This linkage has happened in two ways: (1)
the organizations have provided a platform for discussing common issues to all
Indians, no matter where they lived, and (2) the suppression of the radical Indian
movement by the government in the 1960's and 1970's produced a backlash which
brought about greater solidarity among Indian groups. While they have accomplished
many objectives, their impact has been dulled by several factors. First of all, they have
not been able to develop strong linkages throughout the United States. Nor have they
been able to create stable linkages with "mainstream" organizations, e.g., church
groups, political parties. At best only a thin veneer has linked various Indian groups
together. Second, structural and demographic differences between Indians such as
socio-economic status, region, and politics have brought about disorganization and
intragroup conflict to the overall movement. Nevertheless, Indians feel that their
organizations have changed the federal governments policies toward Indians and
produced some changes desired by Indians.

25
When AIM (The American Indian Movement), a radical Indian organization attempted to establish
itself in Canada, it was summarily rejected by nearly all Canadian Indian leaders. To the extent AIM
existed in Canada, it was supported solely by young, radical Indians.

Indian mobilization has been divided between "tribal based mobilization" and "ethnic
based mobilization." This bifurcation of mobilization has in part been brought about
by the actions taken by government. Federal policy has vacillated between recognizing
tribes as the foci of government programs and legislation and taking an alternative
approach that "Indianness" was the relevant ethnic distinction for policy purposes. As
a result, an analysis of Indian organizations reveals a three-layered structure: the tribal
level, pan-tribal level and the ethnic level.
4.2.3

Sovereignty

Unlike those in Canada, tribal governments in the United States have long been
recognized as having inherent powers. Moreover, the strategies for providing selfgovernment differ between the two countries as we head into the 21st century. In the
United states, it was decided over 150 years ago that Indians have the right to selfgovernment and are to be viewed as domestic nations. Native Americans have not
tried to use constitutional reform as a basis for achieving self-government since they
already have this right embedded into the political structure.26 Instead, Native
Americans have used the courts to support their claims to self-government.
Nevertheless, the political and legal structure of the United States has prevented
Indians from achieving greater levels of self-determination.
The debate over self-government is not a political issue in the United States. As noted
earlier, sovereignty is a given. However, this does not mean that there have not been
debates over the issue. While the government of the United States has tried to restrict
the rights of Indians, the courts have remained an integral part of Indian resistance to
this infringement. Tribes resort to the courts on a regular basis to deal with state
governments trying to exercise their "states rights" over Indian rights, including land
claims (Ewan, 1996). In the end, the issues facing Indians are primarily in the legal
and not the political sphere, so characteristic of the Canadian scene.
Time and time again, the American courts have set limits on the federal and state
government's ability to encroach on tribal powers. Nevertheless, there has been some
erosion of Indians rights over time, forcing tribes to take a defensive and reactive
stance to legal issues. One noticeable change to this stance has been the establishment
of the Native American Rights Fund in 1970 which is a nonprofit national legal
defense firm, representing various tribes in lawsuits and negotiations for treaty rights.
Nevertheless, courts have not always ruled in favour of Native Americans. For
example, in 1996, the Supreme Court ruled (Seminole Tribe vs. Florida) that under the
llth amendment, a state may not be sued by an Indian tribe in federal court, even if
the state is violating a federal law designed to protect Indians and the Indians are
trying to protect themselves from a violation of a federal right (Ewen, 1996).
26
It would seem extremely difficult to introduce constitutional reform in the US since change in the
American Constitution requires an amendment to be passed by two thirds majorities in both houses of
Congress as well as by three quarters of the states. In over two hundred years, there have only been 26
constitutional amendments passed. Moreover, Americans tend to see their Constitution as immutable.

As one can see from the above, no clear and coherent legal perspective can be seen
developing over time as one reviews the decisions of American courts. The
contradictory rulings seem to be based on a variety of "doctrines," and in the end, each
decision can be explained by the politics of the day. Nevertheless, American courts
have been fair and sympathetic to Indian concerns while the actions of Congress have
not.
4.2.4 Economic
Recently, the federal government has attempted to develop industries on reservations.
However, most of these industrial complexes have not been successful nor produced
economic returns to Native Americans. Cottage industries on the reservations have
also been encouraged and these have been marginally successful for a small number of
individuals. There are substantial natural resources on reservations and there has been
some attempt to develop these resources, e.g., reservations encompass about one third
of all low-sulfur coal, six percent of the US total gas and oil reserves and nearly half
of all known uranium reserves. However, it is difficult for small, independent
businesses to enter into a transnational economy. To deal with potential economic
developments on the reservations, forty tribes created the Council of Energy
Resources Tribes in 1971. Today membership has increased to nearly sixty. This
organization provides technical and financial assistance to other member groups and
shares its expertise with Indian communities seeking to develop their economies.
Another group, the League of First Nations (formed in 1995) is a group of independent
Indian business owners (from Iroquois communities).
Presently, the threat to Indian economies (via taxation) on the reservations has tribes
searching for new ways to forge ahead in the economic front. At stake is the long-held
Indian assertion of sovereignty based on aboriginality in their own lands (Martin,
1996). The Supreme Court has once again opened this issue by ruling in a 1980 case
(Washington vs. the Confederated Tribes of Colville Indian Reservation) and again in
1989 (Cotton Petroleum Corporation vs. New Mexico) that the existence of a tribal tax
does not necessarily invalidate a state tax even when the result is dual taxation. Thus,
if businesses were to locate on a reservation, they could be forced to pay both a tribal
and state tax. Under such circumstances few industries or business would choose to
settle on Indian land. In some cases, Indian tribes and state governments have signed
agreements or compacts which provide for tax sharing, preventing dual taxation; such
has been the case with the Fort Peck and Assiniboine Sioux tribes in Montana.27
Recent complications in economic development are a result of a Supreme Court ruling
(Department of Taxation and Finance of the State of New York vs. Milhelm Attea &
Bros Inc.) in 1994. Under this ruling, the state of New York is permitted to collect
taxes on goods sold to non-Indians from Indian retailers. Making economic decisions
27

Rather than fight the state and face exorbitant litigation costs, many Indian tribes are negotiating
with the state to stop dual taxation on reservations.

even more unclear, the state of Oklahoma sued the Chickasaw Nation (Chickasaw
Nation vs. Oklahoma Tax Commission) in an attempt to tax the sale of gas on Indian
lands. The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the Chickasaw Nation (1995) saying that
the state's attempt to impose a fuel tax interfered with the tribes right to selfgovernment.28 Outside the courts, the House of Representatives is considering a bill
(1996) which will prohibit the Bureau of Indian Affairs from transferring any land into
trust for any tribe unless the Secretary of Interior has been informed that a binding
agreement has been established between the Tribe and the state regarding the
collection and payment of state and local sales and excise taxes by non-Indians on
Indian land.29 While this bill has yet to pass the Senate, the chair of the subcommittee
has been an outspoken opponent of Indian sovereignty.
The use of land and rights over water have become major economic issues for some
reservations. For example, when the United States government first set up laws
regarding water, it invoked the "prior appropriation" law which stated that the land
closest to the origin of the water had first rights and then the next closest land, and so
on. When reservations were established in the late 1800's, little thought was given to
the force of this law. After many years of fighting, the courts created the Winters
Doctrine of reserved water rights. Stated simply, all users of rivers had to go to court
and the courts would then decide how much of the water they could use since all
individuals (claims up and down stream) now had water rights. However, the
determination of the amount of water rights for Native Americans was set at what one
lawyer has referred to as "unconscionable" levels. As a result, many reservations are
unable to sustain certain types of development due to lack of water.
A more recent economic activity (gambling) is now being developed by Native
Americans and is a major economic enterprise. In 1994, Native American groups in
more than twenty states operated over 200 gambling operations. No other commercial
activity on Indian lands has matched the success of gambling operations that have
been put in place over the past two decades and Thompson (1996) estimates that
profits collectively exceed Cdn$5 billion each year. In comparison, Canada has only
recently legalized casino gambling and fewer than six Indian casinos are currently in
operation. In both countries, non-Indian companies such as management companies or
equipment industries have aligned themselves with Indians in an attempt to cash in on
the benefits of legalized gambling.

Oklahoma is now considering enacting legislation that would impose the tax at the point of sale but
allow Indians who pay the tax to apply for a refund.
29
The argument is that revenues for the state are lost by allowing tax-free sales to non-Indians. In
addition, non-Indian businesses claim these are unfair business practices. The state of New York, for
example, claims that it loses Cdn$100 million each year.

V

CONCLUSION

In attempting to renegotiate their position in society, Native Americans have used the
courts in a reactive and defensive manner while Canadian Indians have used the courts
to expand and recognize their right to self-government. While Native Americans have
used the courts for well over a century, it is only recently that Canadian Indians have
approached the courts.30 Historically, Canadian courts used narrow and positivistic
approaches to resolve Indian claims. For example, the claim of self-government by
Native peoples is based upon five normative claims (Macklem, 1995): prior
occupancy, prior sovereignty, treaty agreements, self-determination and the
preservation of minority cultures. However, when issues are taken to court, the cases
are generally limited to one argument and do not consider the issues underlying other
claims. This is one of the reasons why many Indians feel that courts are not the best
place to resolve claims. Today Indians have moved to the political forum to solve legal
and social issues facing their communities. For example, the political negotiations of
the 1970's and 1980's led to the constitutional entrenchment of Aboriginal and treaty
rights as well as major land claim settlements.
Today's Native peoples are suspicious of any actions taken by government or business
which involve them. They have been taught costly lessons from the past and there is a
view by Natives that government and business have a hidden agenda each time they
approach them to support or partner. Similarly, they are wary of self-government as
supported by the government. There is a feeling by some that it is a disguised way in
which assimilation will be hastened and control will be in a more benign form.
After reviewing the actions taken by government with regard to Indians, we find that
financial considerations are of crucial importance. Over the past two decades, the
governments have been cutting the budget for Indians, downsizing, delegating services
to Indian communities and decentralizing national structures. Many have argued that
what government calls devolution is simply another way of channeling the
government's responsibility to Indian communities. The issue remains as to whether or
not Indians can deal with the new obligations without sufficient time to prepare, funds
to support, and the will to integrate outside ideas into the Indian way of life.
Within the economic sphere, relationships with Aboriginal people are increasingly
important to corporate Canada. In Canada, many companies have been implementing
active corporate Aboriginal relations programs designed to build constructive
partnerships with communities and expand employment and business opportunities for
Aboriginal people.31 On the other hand, this does not seem to be true for the United
States.
30

This seemingly reluctance to use the courts by Canadian Indians is partially due to the legal
restrictions imposed by the Crown in limiting the Indians' ability to resort to the courts.
31
This action may in part, be due to the creation of the Employment Equity Act, 1986 which forces
private and public businesses to implement equity programs for women, disabled, visible minorities and
Aboriginals.

Any commitment to Aboriginal people to integrate them into the economics of the
corporate world must be multi-dimensional and long term. For any policy to achieve
success, several aspects of the policy must be addressed simultaneously. First, the
participation of Aboriginal peoples must be backed by the leadership of the
corporation, including the Board of Directors. Anything less than top-down, corporate
leadership to significant strategic commitments will result in failure. Second, policies
must be implemented and integrated into the ongoing business corporate culture.
Third, companies must promote education and training, beginning with programs to
encourage young people to stay in school. This means that programs that both directly
and indirectly influence school attendance must be supported. In addition, corporations
must provide educational opportunities and support for Aboriginal students once they
decide to continue their education. Fourth, corporations must provide access to preemployment training in specific skills or business areas. Fifth, companies must
enhance employment opportunities through a number of measures. For example, they
might implement comprehensive work programs which increase the recruitment,
retention and advancement of Aboriginal people. Targeted measures is another
technique that can be effective in increasing the representation of Aboriginal peoples
in workforces. A sixth strategy is to enhance Aboriginal business participation by
providing business opportunities or developing business capabilities.
While examples of the above could be provided in both the United States and Canada,
the actual number of successful, sustainable corporate-Aboriginal economic activities
over the past two decades remains small. Companies are in the business of making
money and if a market can be tapped without sharing it, private enterprise will do so.
Only if Aboriginals are able to stop, slow down or otherwise frustrate the efforts of
money-making ventures will corporations review alternatives such as establishing a
joint venture with Aboriginal communities. Given the diverse interests and the
immense power of major transnational corporations, negotiating with Aboriginals is
not always necessary. The use of Indian political power (particularly in the United
States) and the courts has become a major technique for Aboriginals to deal with
corporate initiatives.
Today the American Congress has instituted a new pattern of assuming its federal trust
responsibility that is similar to termination, as seen in some state-administered block
grants for tribal programs or the outright elimination of tribal line items from budgets
(Martin, 1996a). For example, the cuts to the 1996 Interior Appropriations budget
averaged eleven percent compared to the 32 percent cuts for tribal fisheries, law
enforcement, courts and child welfare.
These new "backlash" bills of the 1990's are similar to those enacted in the 1970's and
1980's. For example, in 1978-79, there were 13 anti-Indian bills introduced to
Congress. A similar number were presented in 1985. These bills focus on eliminating
indigenous water rights, tribal sovereignty, treaties and jurisdiction (Martin, 1996a:
29).

Nevertheless, Indians need to rebuild their vision, developing their traditional
philosophies and using them as guiding lights to the future. Many Indians feel that
because Indians are still distinct in society and despite the fact that many people have
predicted their demise many times, they will continue to remain Indian. However, as
Boldt (1994) points out, they may remain distinctive, but not necessarily Indian. Their
distinctiveness is partially a function of being marginalized, holding specific legal
status, experiencing racism, living on reserves and other social attributes. However,
these are not cultural attributes which make them distinct. At present, Indians are
experiencing a massive deculturalization process in which traditional social systems,
normative patterns and other cultural practices are disappearing. Moreover, a culture
of dependency has emerged. There is an urgent need for cultural revitalization to take
place if Indians are to survive the next generation as Indians and not as member of a
"culture of poverty." Members of the community (cultural maximizers) need to
develop and socialize other members of the community with regard to Indian culture
(from language to philosophy) (Boldt, 1994).
If democracy was the ultimate concern in dealing with Indians, treaty and other claims
would have been settled long ago. Co-optation would be replaced by legitimate
representation and government insistence on unilaterally proclaimed laws, e.g., Indian
citizenship, would no longer be an issue. Nor would anti-Indian lobbyists use rhetoric
to deny Aboriginal people their just entitlements as set out in the treaties.32
Governments have a profound direct, day-to-day control over Native people and their
lives. They are able to set budgets, determining how much money will be spent on
such activities as education and social services. They also have what has been called
"plenary power," meaning that they can do almost anything they want in terms of
Indian-Federal relations. Such power can be used to grant self-government or
terminate the federal relationship (Trahant, 1996: 30).
Both Americans and Canadians seem to want to recognize the distinctiveness of
Indians and have not rejected outright the concept of self-government or selfdetermination. However, at the same time, both countries have hedged their support to
such a reconceptualization, particularly if it means there will be changes to power
structures and a redistribution of resources. In the end, while there may be some
changes, the central policy structures and the definition of these policies still remains
within the control of the federal government. If Indians are to enter the institutional
spheres of 21st century America, they must begin to play a significant, ongoing
political and economic role.

32
In the United States, government actions are seen as turning tribes into felons because if the tribes
did not accept the reduction of sovereignty, they would be committing crimes against the state. The
states are arguing that they have supreme power, regardless of the existence of federal treaties.
