OF TREATIES AND TORTURE:
HOW THE SUPREME COURT CAN
RESTRAIN THE EXECUTIVE
Jeffrey C. Goldman

Introduction1

The Bush administration's original (and now superseded)
"torture memos" strain contemporary understandings of the United

States' obligations under the Convention Against Torture.2 These
documents also mock traditional understandings of the relationship
between international law and treaties and of the executive's power

to interpret and apply them.3 Perhaps most alarming are the

administration's attempts to undermine the spirit of both domestic

legislation and international law by employing a "strict
constructionist" interpretive methodology while embracing an
expansive view of executive power. The Bush administration's

Court with legitimate, constitutional reasons to overrule
congressional and executive treaty interpretations. Although U.S.
courts long ago adopted a rule of construction that accorded treaties
and statutes equal weight,8 jurists added a caveat: "fujnless it is for
some reason distinguishable from other laws, the rule which [a treaty]
gives may be displaced by the legislative power, at its pleasure."9

Treaties dealing with peremptory norms are categorically
different from other treaties. Human rights treaties, and related
implementing legislation, grant specific and far-reaching rights
directly to individuals. These rights, by virtue of reason, should be
held by courts as equal to constitutional freedoms and rights; like
those freedoms and rights, neither the executive nor the legislative
branch should be able to alter or infringe them in any but the most
compelling circumstances (and certainly not unilaterally, as by
executive order). The Supreme Court's recognition of this
equivalence would give it an axe to wield that it cannot carry into
interpretative battles regarding other treaties.10 This axe can restore
the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial
branches and ensure that the United States, which has led the world
in recognizing and promoting human rights, retains its high moral
ground.
This Note argues that because human rights are fundamental in
nature, and because the exercise of constitutional rights is predicated
on the enjoyment of more basic human rights, courts should treat
human rights treaties differently than other international agreements
the United States has signed or ratified. Part I of this Note reviews

the judiciary's understanding of the relationship between

granting most-favored-nation status to Russia because "[t]here is ... nothing in the mere fact
that a treaty is a law, which would prevent congress from repealing it"); see also Chew Heong v.

jus cogens norms in international law and demon
has entered the canon of such norms. Part II begin
of the function and interpretation of treaties

argues that human rights treaties should be categorically

distinguished from those dealing with other subjects. It then argues

that equating human rights with constitutional rights is both

appropriate and necessary if human rights treaties are to achieve their

full potential. Part III suggests a limit for the executive's treaty
interpretation power and specifically demonstrates that executive
power to terminate treaties unilaterally does not extend to human
rights treaties. Part III then argues that recognizing human rights
treaties as a distinct category offers the judiciary a way to restrain the
executive without running afoul of the political question doctrine.

I. International Law, Peremptory Norms, and Torture

This Part examines the relationship between international law,
peremptory norms, and torture. Section A describes the history of
U.S. courts' recognition of international law and the Supreme Court's
understanding of the relationship between domestic and international
law. Section B defines j us cogens (peremptory) norms and their place
in the international law hierarchy and establishes torture as a jus
cogens norm.

A. Recognition of International Law by U.S. Courts

International law "consists of rules and principles of general
application dealing with the conduct of states and of international
organizations and with their relations . . . [including] some of their

relations with persons."11 These rules are derived from treaties,

customs, and principles common to major world legal systems.12 This

definition, however, does not explain how U.S. courts have

traditionally treated international law in general, and customary
international law and jus cogens specifically. This Section briefly
describes U.S. jurisprudence regarding international law.

wrote:

court acknowledged that there were "few, if any, issues in
international law ... on which opinion seems to be so united as the
limitations on a state's power to torture."44 And, in discussing whether

the United Nations Charter conveyed individual rights to citizens of
member countries, the court added that "the guaranties include, at a
bare minimum, the right to be free from torture."45 Interestingly,
Filartiga was decided almost fifteen years prior to the United States'

accession to the Convention Against Torture, supporting the
contention that torture had already achieved the status of a

peremptory, binding norm prior to the Convention.46

As a jus cogens norm, torture deserves greater protection than

other rights - perhaps even greater protection than other
constitutional rights. As discussed in Part II, this heightened
protection suggests a way to distinguish treaties by subject matter.
II. Distinguishing Human Rights Treaties

The previous Part established that the U.S. is boun

international law and that torture is widely recognized as a j

norm under international law. This Part discusses the rel
between international and domestic law, focusing on treatie

law. Section A also reviews U.S. courts' traditiona
treaties and the relationship between treaties, in
domestic law. Section B equates the substantive r
human rights treaties, especially jus cogens norms,
rights.

At the outset, the looming presence of Goldwater v. Carter1
should be acknowledged. In Goldwater, a plurality of the Court held
that a challenge to President Carter's unilateral termination of a
commercial treaty with Taiwan was a nonjusticiable political
question.48 Although Goldwater has precedential value, its reasoning
should apply only to certain types of treaties. Specifically, this Note

argues that Goldwatefs nonjusticiability rule should apply only to
commercial treaties and should not apply to human rights treaties. As

this Note explains in Section A and further develops in Part III.A,
commercial and human rights treaties can be distinguished on the
basis of purpose (contractual vs. codification) and subject matter
(commercial vs. human rights). These distinctions are crucial in
determining whether nonjusticiability should apply.

A. Methods for Distinguishing Treaties
A treaty is "[a]n agreement formally signed, ratified, or adhered

to between two nations or sovereigns; an international agreement
concluded between two or more states in written form and governed
by international law."49 A treaty is, essentially, a "contract between
nations" and is usually treated like a contract rather than a legislative

act.50 Madison commented that "[t]he object of treaties is the
regulation of intercourse with foreign nations and is external."51

49. Black's Law Dictionary 1540 (8th ed. 2004). For purposes of this Note, "treaty"
will generally refer to any international agreement entered into by the United States and will
not be limited to those agreements executed under the president's Article II authority. See, e.g.,

Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, art. 2(l)(a), May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331
(defining a treaty as an international agreement between states, "whether embodied in a single
instrument or in two or more related instruments and whatever its particular designation"); B.
Altman & Co. v. United States, 224 U.S. 583, 601 (1912) (holding as a treaty, for jurisdictional
purposes, "a compact authorized by the Congress . . . [and] negotiated and proclaimed" by the
president).

However, although treaties often resemble contract
sometimes perform statutory or legislative functions

in the United States, where treaties are considered
the land.53 Both contractual and lawmaking treat
considered sources of international law; neither in

domestic law, however, accords all laws equa

example, the consequence of breaching a contract

different from the consequence for breakin

incarceration). In the second half of the twent
international agreements typically focused on economic,
transportation-communication, cultural-technical, diplomatic, and
military issues.55

Historically, U.S. courts have interpreted treaties "in the manner

and to the extent [to] which the parties have declared, and not
otherwise."56 The Supreme Court has no power "to alter, amend, or
add to any treaty, by inserting any clause" because that "would be to
make, and not to construe a treaty."57 Treaties generally are deemed
to have the same weight as federal law but are not superior to the

Constitution.58

The remainder of this Section describes the traditional

classification scheme for treaties and suggests an alternate
methodology. The Section concludes by asserting that human rights
treaties can be clearly distinguished from other treaties based on their
subject matter and applies the proposed methodology to prove the
argument. Some treaties that seek to achieve multiple objectives or

that take a comprehensive approach to problem-solving might be
difficult to classify, but this Note is not concerned with such

borderline cases. The classification scheme described in this Note will

ownership to a grant when the land was under Spanish possession; the
other to a grant once the land came under U.S. control.68 The former
claimed that the United States was bound by treaty to honor Spain's

grant to the title holder.69 Marshall parsed the treaty's language,

holding that it did not automatically confer property rights on those
who received grants when the land was under Spanish control; rather,
such grants were only valid once confirmed by Congress.70

A treaty is in its nature a contract between two nations, not a legislative act. It
does not generally effect, of itself, the object to be accomplished, especially so far as
its operation is infra-territorial; but is carried into execution by the sovereign power
of the respective parties to the instrument.
In the United States a different principle is established. Our constitution declares
a treaty to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of

justice as equivalent to an act of the legislature, whenever it operates of itself without
the aid of any legislative provision. But when the terms of the stipulation import a
contract, when either of the parties engages to perform a particular act, the treaty
addresses itself to the political, not the judicial department; and the legislature must
execute the contract before it can become a rule for the Court.

significant portion of the United States73 - and possibly anticipated
and enabled the Manifest Destiny movement which would flourish in

the 1840s.74

Marshall's distinction between self-executing and non-selfexecuting treaties, then, might not reflect an overarching judicial
philosophy so much as a convenient fix for exigent circumstances.75

Indeed, the Court itself has on occasion rejected Marshall's
dichotomy. For example, in the Head Money Cases™ the Court
distinguished between contractual treaties, which conferred no

individual rights, and statutory treaties, which did.77 The Head Money
Cases dealt with the validity of an excise tax on immigrants - a tax

its rights of dominion over a country of which it is in possession, and which it claims
under a treaty; if the legislature has acted on the construction thus asserted, it is not in
its own courts that this construction is to be denied. A question like this respecting

the boundaries of nations, is, as has been truly said, more a political than a legal
question ....

Id. at 309. Note that the treaty in question is of a contractual, rather than a lawmaking type,
dealing as it does with possession of land - which is immediately recognizable as a real property
transaction.

nation . . . have unequivocally asserted its rights of dominion over a ... possession ... it is not in

M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543 (1823), in which he held a property claim raised by Indians

e.g., Christopher L. Eisgruber, John Marshall's Judicial Rhetoric, 1996 SUP. Ct. Rev. 439, 445
(describing and analyzing Marshall's adjudicative style). As Professor Eisgruber comments:
John Marshall faced the task of demonstrating that crucial and difficult constitutional

questions could be resolved without leaving American politics subject to the

undisciplined play of either legislative or judicial discretion. An important part of
Marshall's response was tactical .... Marshall aggressively took advantage of political

circumstances to deflect attacks upon the Court and to secure useful precedents.

acknowledging that a treaty's subject matte
executing nature, granted individual rights.90

Rauscher is not the only example of the Supreme Court
distinguishing treaties based on subject-matter classification. For
example, in considering whether certain provisions of the Jay Treaty
of 1794 between the United States and the United Kingdom survived
the War of 1812, the Court unanimously held: "The doctrine . . . that
war ipso facto annuls treaties of every kind ... is repudiated by the

great weight of modern authority; and the view now commonly
accepted is that 'whether the stipulations of a treaty are annulled by
war depends upon their intrinsic character.'"91 Specifically, the Court

distinguished treaties "having a political character" from those
dealing with substantive issues, such as possession of property by
nationals, boundary decisions, and "provisions which represent
completed acts."92 The Court ultimately distinguished treaty articles
vesting rights "permanent in character" which were "by their very

nature . . . fixed and continuing" from those rights which were

"wholly promissory and prospective."93

3. Human Rights Treaties and the Subject-Matter Distinction.
Applying the distinction between treaties vesting personal and
permanent rights (human rights treaties) and promissory rights
(contractual agreements) to the Goldwater holding, a commercial
treaty (like that in Goldwater) might confer derivative individual
rights, but a human rights treaty clearly implicates rights "permanent

in character."94 Whereas nations might contract for certain privileges
in a commercial treaty, such that the parties merit the benefits of their

precedent for this analysis. In the Head Money Cases, the Court held that
[a] treaty, then, is a law of the land, as an act of Congress is, whenever its provisions

prescribe a rule by which the rights of the private citizen or subject may be

determined. And when such rights are of a nature to be enforced in a court of justice,

bargains, to speak of treaties as creating bargain
human beings seems offensive.95 Unfortunately,
courts have generally relied on Chief Justice Mar

rather than the substance of treaties to determine whether treaties

create individual rights. Sadly for both human rights activists and
potential torture victims, Marshall's dichotomy quite often has been
applied to human rights treaties. For example, a district court held
that the United Nations Charter was non-self-executing and therefore
did "not vest any of the plaintiffs with individual legal rights."96
Similarly, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR)97 has been found to be non-self-executing.98 Specifically
because of their non-self-executing nature, neither the ICCPR nor the
Convention Against Torture were deemed to have created "a private
right of action under which the plaintiffjs could] successfully state a

claim."99

In applying Marshall's dichotomy to human rights treaties, courts
have created a quagmire of case law that is replete with exceptions.

For example, in evaluating the applicability of the Geneva

Conventions to General Manuel Noriega, a court noted that although
most international treaties have been found to be non-self-executing,

this determination must be made for each treaty individually.100

torturous route to discerning individual rights from

neither to individuals seeking protection under
burdened with the laws' enforcement.

Rather than relying on a structural analysis of whether a treaty is

self-executing, courts should use the content, substance, and purpose
of the treaty to determine whether treaties confer private, individual
rights. Human rights treaties are prime contenders for conferring
private rights based on their content and purpose because "[h]uman
rights conventions address the rights of individuals" by their very
nature.105 This proposal is not unprecedented: as the Noriega court

noted, "[i]t must not be forgotten that the [Geneva] Conventions
have been drawn up first and foremost to protect individuals."106

Categorically distinguishing human rights conventions and other

international agreements is not too great a task for the judiciary.

constitutional rights as marriage and procreation
need not be explicitly enumerated. If human righ
codify, rather than legislate, human rights derived

must be at least as judicially cognizable as nonenumerated
constitutional rights. Furthermore, jus cogens norms ought to be
recognized as a superior kind of right; it is logically inconceivable that
a court would protect the right to marry but turn a blind eye to more
fundamental threats to life and liberty, such as torture.119

Additionally, a ratified treaty can be said to embody the
sovereign will of the United States. But such sovereignty "reside[s] in

the people, for whom the President and the Senate [are] merely

agents."120 At a minimum, then, human rights treaties should be able
to add to the rights and liberties enjoyed by Americans, similar to the
way in which other kinds of constitutive documents create obligations
and privileges. Rights deemed to be fundamental, of course, include
not only limitations prohibiting certain government actions but also
positive government obligations.121

Given the Supreme Court's reluctance, until the 1920s, to protect
civil liberties, and its current bent toward strict constructionism, it is

not surprising that the Court has failed to find many positive
obligations created by international human rights agreements.122 But

the Court's reluctance to do so, and the slow development of

domestic human rights jurisprudence generally, does not mean that
the Court should, or will, turn a blind eye to human rights claims in
the future - especially when such claims arise from treaties.123 States
may be the actors that draft and ratify human rights agreements, but

Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485-86 (1965) (recognizing the right to use

contraception).

119. Although slavery, also prohibited as a jus cogens norm, was embedded in, and perhaps
even essential to the ratification of, the Constitution, the fact that the Framers failed to
completely embody the ideals they drew upon in shaping a new country's government should
not be used to justify violating an analogous norm two hundred years later.

Finally, as consensus has developed that at least some
international human rights norms - jus cogens norms like torture and
genocide - do guarantee, at a minimum, the right to be free from the
activity prohibited, it is entirely appropriate for courts to recognize
such rights as coequal with constitutional rights.128 In Banco Nacional

de Cuba v. Sabbatino™ for example, the Court noted that "the
greater the degree of codification or consensus concerning a

particular area of international law, the more appropriate it is for the
judiciary to render decisions regarding it."130

Recognizing jus cogens norms as coequal with constitutional
rights would also be consistent with existing jurisprudence. Further,
such recognition would not run afoul of the Court's concerns that it
would be infringing on the political branches' spheres of influence.131

contention that "the less important the implication

exclusivity, given the important signal proclamation of adherence to
human rights norms sends. Yet, in this context, the government's
willingness to allow courts to enforce promises made by the political
branches may send an even stronger signal.132

Finally, treating jus cogens norms as constitutional rights could

expand the class of individuals protected by those norms. Courts
could feel comfortable extending the protection of the United States

not just to American citizens but to anyone whose fundamental
human rights are violated by an American national under the

nationality and territorial principles. Under the nationality principle,
u[a] state may prosecute its nationals for crimes committed anywhere
in the world."133 Under the territorial principle, "[e]very state [can]
claim[] jurisdiction over crimes committed in its own territory."134

Although these principles originated with regard to criminal

activities, a strong argument can be made that violations of human
rights constitute criminal acts.135 On a purely domestic level, the
Supreme Court has acknowledged that noncitizen residents, even if
present on U.S. territory illegally, are entitled to some rights.136 Surely
fundamental human rights should rank among them.

III. Constraining the Executive, Empowering the Judiciary

constitutional rights under American law, and if courts are competent
to hear cases arising under human rights treaties, to what extent can

confronted with such an attempt, should not fe

individual rights. Further, courts should construe treaty

interpretations or modifications as unconstitutional when inconsistent

with binding international law. Under this theory, the president
cannot unilaterally abrogate a human rights treaty or, at most, can
only abrogate those treaties not dealing with jus cogens norms. Nor
can the executive promulgate an interpretation of a treaty that is
inconsistent with international law. In other words, human rights and

related treaties can constrain the executive and empower the

judiciary.
A. Limitations on the Executive's Foreign Affairs Powers
This Section contends that the president is not solely responsible
for international affairs, suggests some limitations on the president's
ability to interpret and execute treaties, and shows that the president
lacks the power to abrogate human rights treaties codifying jus cogens
norms.

1. The President Is Not Solely Responsible for In
Affairs. Although the Constitution can be read as

president with "primary constitutional authority over t
foreign affairs,"137 the president is not the "sole orga

Perhaps, then, the Court wants to avoid a m
opinion. One of the justifications for the Bus

strained definition of torture was that there was no international

consensus regarding the degree of suffering required to constitute
torture.167 But, if the Convention merely codified international law
and neither defined the offense nor legislated its prohibition, the

Court surely would be able to ascertain some definition of what
constitutes torture. After all, one Justice famously remarked

regarding obscenity, that he knew it when he saw it; surely torture
however difficult to define, is equally recognizable in the majority o
cases.168 And, if the Bush administration's definition conflicted wit
the commonly understood definition of torture, construing a human
rights treaty as vesting individual rights would provide the Court with

a clear rationale for rejecting the administration's definition. As th
arbiter of the meaning of constitutional rights, the judicial branch

and not the executive, should bear responsibility for, and asser
authority over, the interpretation of human rights treaties.169
The Bush administration also claimed that a defense of

"necessity" justified contravening not just the Convention A
Torture, but also relevant domestic legislation.170 But the Co
itself indicates that "[n]o exceptional circumstances whatsoe
may be invoked as a justification of torture."171 The Court sh

the kind of judicially manageable standard found lacking in
Goldwater. Such an approach would give the Court a legitimate
reason to supersede either political branch's opinion while

simultaneously avoiding accusations of ideological or political bias.
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has opted for none of these
approaches to date. In 2004, in fact, it declined to interpret and apply

international human rights law, accepting the Senate's declaration
that the ICCPR is non-self-executing and therefore does not confer
any individual rights.173 Fortunately, the Court did not entirely close
the door to such an approach. It merely insisted that "any claim based
on the present-day law of nations . . . rest on a norm of international

character accepted by the civilized world and defined with a
specificity comparable to the features of ... 18th-century

paradigms"174 and noted that "the door is still ajar subject to vigilant
doorkeeping"175 and "independent judicial recognition of actionable

international norms."176

A decision that human rights treaties, because of their unique
nature and function, should be treated differently from other treaties,

and specifically that jus cogens norms deserve special status, would
allow the Court to constrain the executive without raising the fear of
an out-of-control judiciary.
