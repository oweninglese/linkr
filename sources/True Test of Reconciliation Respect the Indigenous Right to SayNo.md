Conflict is coming. There is no getting around that fact. Anyone who believes 
that reconciliation will be about blanket exercises, cultural awareness 
training, visiting a native exhibit at a museum or hanging native artwork in 
public office buildings doesn’t understand how we got here. Reconciliation 
between Canada and Indigenous peoples has never been about multiculturalism, 
diversity or inclusion. Reconciliation is not an affirmative-action program, nor
is it about adding token Indigenous peoples to committees, advisory groups or 
board rooms. We cannot tokenize our way out of this mess that Canada created. 
Real reconciliation requires truth be exposed, justice be done to make amends 
and then Canada’s discriminatory laws, policies, practices and societal norms be
reconciled with Indigenous rights, title, treaties, laws and jurisdiction. That 
process of truth, justice and reconciliation will be painful. It requires a 
radical change. Nothing less than the transfer of land, wealth and power to 
Indigenous peoples will set things right. The true test of reconciliation will 
be whether Canada respects the Indigenous right to say ‘no.’
 
Canadian courts have been issuing decisions about Aboriginal rights and title 
and treaty rights, sending the strong message to governments that they must 
obtain the consent of Indigenous peoples before taking actions or making 
decisions that will impact our lives. Governments have not listened. Canada’s 
failure to listen is one of the reasons why Indigenous peoples spent more than 
25 years negotiating the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples which guarantees the right of Indigenous peoples to free, prior and 
informed consent. Article 19 of UNDRIP provides:
 
States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples 
concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their
free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or
administrative measures that may affect them.
 
Consent is a legal concept which can be defined as the voluntary acquiescence of
one person to the proposal of another. In general, it is the right to say yes or
no to something and/or put conditions on an agreement. Consent must be free from
misrepresentations, deceptions, fraud or duress. This is a very basic right, but
one which has been denied to Indigenous peoples since contact. Take for example,
the actions of Indian agents and police, who used food rations to extort sex 
from Indigenous women and girls. In the context of being forced to live on 
reserves, not being allowed to leave the reserve and being dependent on food 
rations, what real choice would a young girl have? Similarly, when police 
officers or judges detain Indigenous women and girls, drive them to secluded 
locations and force them to perform sexual acts — there is no real consent when 
the threat of lethal force or arrest on false charges is ever-present. This is 
especially so given our knowledge of the number of assaults and deaths of our 
people in police custody. There was no consent when they stole our children and 
put them into residential schools, nor was there any consent when priests, nuns 
and others raped those children. There was no consent when doctors forcibly 
sterilized Indigenous women and girls — sometimes without their knowledge.
 
Today, the right of Indigenous peoples to free, prior and informed consent has 
become the central issue in Canada’s reconciliation agenda. Justin Trudeau 
campaigned on the promise of implementing UNDRIP into law and respecting the 
right of Indigenous peoples to say no. When asked by APTN host Cheryl McKenzie 
whether no would mean no under his government, he responded “absolutely.” 
Another way of putting this is that Indigenous peoples could exercise their 
legal right to refuse to approve or authorize a project. This veto right stems 
from various sources, but primarily our inherent rights as Indigenous 
governments with our own laws and rules which govern our traditional 
territories. They may also come from specific Aboriginal rights, treaty rights 
and Aboriginal title. These rights are not only protected within our own 
Indigenous laws, but also section 35 of Canada’s Constitution Act, 1982 and 
various international human rights laws, including UNDRIP. Yet, after Trudeau 
announced his latest idea to create a legislative framework to recognize 
Indigenous rights and avoid litigation, Justice Minister Raybould stated clearly
that “consent doesn’t mean a veto” for Indigenous peoples.
 
So, we are now back where we started. Canada has not yet reconciled its laws, 
policies or political positions to the fact that Indigenous peoples have the 
right to say no to development projects on our lands. This means that conflict 
will continue to grow over mining, forestry, hydraulic fracking and pipelines on
Indigenous lands. The true test of reconciliation will inevitably play out on 
the ground, like it did in Oka, Ipperwash, Gustafsen Lake, Esgenoopetitj (Burnt 
Church) and Elsipogtog. Will Canada force the Kinder Morgan pipeline to go ahead
against the will of British Columbia and First Nations? Will Canada isolate and 
exclude First Nations who do not subscribe to the extinguishment requirements of
Canada’s land-claims process? What will happen to First Nations who stop 
provincial social workers and police officers from entering their reserves to 
steal more children into foster care? This will be the real test of our inherent
right to say no.
 
Canada will only truly give effect to reconciliation when Indigenous peoples 
have the right to say no — no to discriminatory government laws and policies; no
to federal and provincial control over our Nations; no to racism from society, 
industry and government; no to sexualized violence, abuse and trafficking; no to
theft of our children into foster care and the imprisonment of our peoples; no 
to the ongoing theft of our lands and resources; and no to the contamination and
destruction of our lands, waters, plants, animals, birds and fish. The right to 
say no is the core of any future relationship with the Canadian state and its 
citizens. It’s a basic right — one which is grounded in our sovereignty as 
individuals and Nations to decide for ourselves the life we wish to live. Canada
has made it clear we have no right to say no, only an obligation to say yes. 
First Nations leaders and citizens should not wait to see how this plays out in 
court – they should assert and defend their right to say no now.
