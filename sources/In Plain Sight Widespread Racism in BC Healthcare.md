RACISM IN BC HEALTHCARE
-----------------------
 
Imagineliving in a country, where hospitals refused to treat you for a stroke, 
because the doctors and nurses assumed you were drunk? Imagine further, that the
emergency room doctor refused to treat your young child for epilepsy, because 
they assumed she was on drugs? Well folks, that country is Canada.
 
It doesn’t sound like the Canada you know. It doesn’t seem to reflect Canada’s 
world-renowned medical experts and hospitals. Nor does it seem to jive with 
Canada’s impressive array of human rights protections. Yet, if you are 
Indigenous in Canada, you can expect this kind of treatment and worse - even in 
Canada’s best hospitals in British Columbia (BC).

Just before the holidays, a report was released which confirmed what most 
Indigenous peoples already knew – that racism against Indigenous peoples, 
especially First Nations peoples - is widespread in BC’s healthcare system.
 
IN PLAIN SIGHT
 
The report entitled - In Plain Sight: Addressing Indigenous-specific Racism and 
Discrimination in B.C. Health Care - was written by Dr. Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond
who was the first, First Nations judge appointed to the Provincial Court of 
Saskatchewan; was the former Child and Youth Advocate in BC; and now the 
independent investigator for this report.
 
She had been appointed by BC’s Minister of Health to conduct a review of racism 
against Indigenous peoples in BC’s healthcare system. Dr. Turpel-Lafond and her 
Indigenous-led team engaged in four months of investigations, which included:
 
- talking to 9,000 people from BC;
 
- reviewing 185,000 data sets including more than 900 studies; and
 
- logging 600 cases via their 1-800 number and website.
 
The report – which includes both its core findings and recommendations - 
contains numerous examples of Indigenous peoples given substandard medical 
treatment or no treatment at all in hospitals and healthcare facilities of all 
kinds. In some cases, individuals were treated so poorly, that they refused to 
go back for treatment and this was especially true for Indigenous women.

FINDINGS
 
There were 11 main findings divided into (a) the problem of Indigenous-specific 
racism and (b) the problem with current solutions – both of which provide 
significant insight into the lack of accountability for racism and the harm it 
causes Indigenous peoples in BC’s healthcare systems.
 
Her main findings in relation to anti-Indigenous racism were as follows:
 
(1) Widespread Indigenous-specific stereotyping, racism and discrimination exist
in the BC healthcare system;
 
(2) Racism limits access to medical treatment and negatively affects the health 
and wellness of Indigenous peoples in BC;
 
(3) Indigenous women and girls are disproportionately impacted by 
Indigenous-specific racism in the healthcare system;
 
(4) Current public health emergencies magnify racism and vulnerabilities, and 
disproportionately impact Indigenous peoples and
 
(5) Indigenous health care workers face racism and discrimination in their work 
environments.
 
She also noted that talking about anti-Indigenous racism in healthcare can be 
very triggering for Indigenous peoples who have experienced the physical and 
mental harms associated with racist comments, substandard treatment or the 
denial of treatment. At the same time, she also stressed that the issue must be 
named, so that institutions can be held to account and the problems addressed.

STEREOTYPES
 
Dr. Turpel-Lafond shared the eight most common racist stereotypes held by BC 
healthcare workers about Indigenous peoples (primarily First Nations, and 
include that belief that they are:
 
(1) Less worthy of care;
 
(2) Drinkers/alchoholics;
 
(3) Drug-seekers;
 
(4) Bad parents;
 
(5) Frequent flyers – misuse health system;
 
(6) Irresponsible & wont do aftercare;
 
(7) Less capable; and
 
(8) Unfairly advantaged.
 
RACISM CAUSES REAL HARM
 
She also stressed that these racist stereotypes lead to real physical harm, 
mental harm and even death for Indigenous peoples, in the following ways:
 
(1) Unacceptable personal interactions - like racist comments;
 
(2) Long wait times/denial of service – more so than non-Indigenous patients;
 
(3) Lack of communication/shunning Indigenous patients;
 
(4) Not believing or minimizing health concerns – Indigenous peoples accused of 
faking;
 
(5) Inappropriate or no pain management – assuming patients are drug seeking;
 
(6) Rough treatment – like man-handling or physical harm;
 
(7) Medical mistakes & misdiagnosis – assuming patients drunk and not addressing
underlying health issues; and
 
(8) Lack of respect for cultural protocols – intolerance of families or 
ceremonies.
 
The significant harms experienced by Indigenous peoples on a regular basis are 
why the report's recommendations on how to move forward to address 
anti-Indigenous racism in BC’s healthcare system are so important. At their 
core, the recommendations all work to confronting the legacy of colonialism in 
healthcare head on:
 
"A basic awareness has grown that the current inequities and injustices faced by
Indigenous peoples in Canada – such as those examined in this Review – are 
deeply rooted in an enduring legacy of colonialism, and that confronting that 
legacy requires substantive, transformative change."
 
MOVING FORWARD
 
It is important that Canadians read this report and then push governments, 
hospitals, universities and all those working in the healthcare system, in any 
capacity to embrace their role in reconciliation and ensuring that the human 
rights of Indigenous peoples to healthcare are respected, protected and fully 
implemented. To do this, Dr. Turpel-Lafond believes that our collective path 
forward must be based on acknowledging and accepting three foundational 
principles:
 
(1) Racism in healthcare reflects a lack of respect for Indigenous rights to 
health;
 
(2) Racism in the healthcare system is integrated with racism in society; and
 
(3) While Indigenous voices must be centered in developing solutions, the 
responsibility to do this work rests with non-Indigenous people, communities, 
organizations and governments.
 
Before anyone breathes a sigh of relief that this is only a BC issue – it isn’t.
Anti-Indigenous racism in healthcare is rampant in other provinces as well. It 
was only weeks ago, that Quebec came under fire when a video showed nurses 
saying racist and hateful comments to Joyce Echaquan before she died in the 
hospital. This was not an isolated incident but reflects a long-standing pattern
of racism experience by Indigenous peoples in Quebec hospitals.

Don’t forget the Brian Sinclair inquiry in Manitoba, which documented how the 
hospital staff ignored Brian – a double amputee confined to a wheel chair - for 
34 hours until he subsequently died of a treatable urinary tract infection. And 
sadly, these are not exceptional cases. From the Royal Commission on Aboriginal 
Peoples in 1996 to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s report in 2015 and 
the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report
in 2019 – racism in healthcare is a national crisis and has been for decades. 
 
HEALTHCARE IS A HUMAN RIGHT
 
Racism in healthcare is a matter of life and death for Indigenous peoples and 
forms part of the ongoing genocide that the National Inquiry talked about in 
their report.
 
It was important for the BC government to undertake this investigation and 
accept the findings. Every other province and territory should follow suit and 
conduct a similar investigation. While it is important that BC's Minister of 
Health Adrian Dix apologized and committed to take action - it is yet to be seen
whether they will take the action needed to hold themselves accountable, make 
the required changes and make reparations to Indigenous peoples. Given the many 
reports sitting on government shelves gathering dust – it is incumbent on 
Canadians to do their part to ensure governments are held to account.
 
Healthcare is a basic human right and we are all served when we take steps to 
make sure that all peoples – including Indigenous peoples – can enjoy that 
right.
