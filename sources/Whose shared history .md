## Whose Shared History?

```

On xi June 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued an historic apology
to former students of Indian residential schools. While the Prime Minister
should certainly be commended for his role in addressing this dark "chapter"
in Canadian history, we must not forget that the apology was part of a larger
settlement addressing Indian residential schools. In his remarks offered on
behalf of "all Canadians," Prime Minister Harper apologized for the physical,
sexual, and emotional abuse suffered by former students and for the inter
generational effects caused by a policy of assimilation. The words spoken by
the Prime Minister that day continue to resonate with profound and emo
tional cadences. Invoking the language of "healing" and "reconciliation," the
Prime Minister called for a "new beginning" based upon knowledge of "our
shared history." For many Indigenous people, however, the words spoken in
the apology do not accurately represent their experience with colonialism and
Canada's history as a settler society.
The narrative of the Canadian nation offered by the Prime Minister is one
that selectively omits a history of genocide, territorial dispossession, cul
tural destruction, and regime replacement in favour of a rendering of history
which represents Canada as a primarily British settler society - one whose
past includes a discreet chapter containing the consequences of policies with
"lasting and damaging impacts." In his admiration for Canada as a British
settler society, the Prime Minister continually forgets that Canada is itself a
settler society, allowing him to view residential schools as an isolated event. In
his remarks at a press conference during a meeting of the G20 in Pittsburgh
in 2009, the Prime Minister said the following about the history of Canada:
We are a very large country... we have one of the longest-standing democratic regimes,
unbroken democratic regimes, in history. We are one of the most stable regimes in
history. There are very few countries that can say for nearly 150 years they've had the same
political system without any social breakdown, political upheaval or invasion. We are
unique in that regard. We also have no history of colonialism. So we have all of the things
that many people admire about the great powers, but none of the things that threaten or
bother them about the great powers.
```

We also are a country, obviously beginning with our two major cultures, but also a  
country formed by people from all over the world that is able to speak cross-culturally in a  
way few other countries are able to do at international forums.

FORUM: history under HARPER / 201
```

While the Prime Minister could have been referring to a history of colonial  
ism beyond Canada's territorial waters, it must be remembered that Canada  
began as a country that actively engaged in colonialism within its own borders  
as it continued to expand westward and northward, disposing Indigenous  
peoples of their territories and continuing the same policy trajectory as its  
Imperial counterparts. The Prime Minister's description of the country as  
originating from "two major cultures" fails to acknowledge the multiplicity of  
Indigenous nations whose territories Canada now claims as its own. This not  
only ignores the territories possessed by Indigenous peoples and their rela  
tionships with the Crown, but also the shared and intersecting histories they  
have with those two cultures and the many others that have since arrived.  
Beyond their denial of Canada's history as a colonizing nation, Prime Minister  
Harper's remarks are also problematic as they engage in the production of  
national myths which not only exclude the violence and political upheaval  
embedded within the Canadian state but also the corresponding Indigenous  
resistances that continue to occur. We must not forget that Canada has actively  
engaged in multiple acts of regime replacement under the Indian Act. Many  
such acts have been extremely violent and have led not only to the imprison  
ment of Indigenous leaders, but also, in at least one instance, execution, which  
was the fate of Jake Fire in 1899.  
Perhaps the most emblematic representation of Prime Minister Harper's  
approach to history can be observed in his reification of Canada as a settler  
society unified under the constitutional legacy of the British Crown. This  
vision can be seen in Canada's celebration of both the Queen's Diamond Jubilee  
and the War of 1812. The celebrations of these events could be read not only  
as ignoring the claims of Québec, but also as denying Indigenous nationhood  
and Indigenous sovereignty. Such discursive sleights of hand are exceedingly  
troubling as they privilege a colonial interpretation of the past which suggests  
that there has been a unilateral assertion of Crown sovereignty while simul  
taneously denying Indigenous treaty relationships and interactions with the  
Crown. While Indigenous people have been acknowledged as British "allies"  
in the War of 1812, the singular focus on the American invasion misrepre  
sents Indigenous involvement and their alliances with the Crown. By focusing  
on these moments as uniquely "Canadian" vignettes, the Prime Minister has  
missed an opportunity to explore what is perhaps the most pivotal moment in  
"our shared history."  
The event which should be commemorated is the 250th anniversary of  
the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the ratification of the Treaty of Niagara  
the following year. These are pivotal events in our shared history for they are  
the events which allowed for the sharing of the Indigenous territories now  
known as "Canada." While the Royal Proclamation is typically viewed as a  
unilateral declaration of Crown sovereignty and an attempt to deal with "the  
Québec problem," such an understanding is both misleading and historically  
inaccurate. As scholars such as John Borrows and Peter Russell remind us,

the historical significance of the Royal Proclamation does not culminate in  
1763, but instead must be understood in relation to the treaty negotiations  
at Niagara involving some two thousand Indigenous leaders who represented  
nations throughout the Americas. This treaty set forth an agreement in prin  
ciple which would allow for the sharing of select Indigenous lands while also  
maintaining, recognizing, and affirming the sovereignty of all nations (both  
settler and Indigenous) and the entrenchment of legal and constitutional  
pluralism.  
The prime minister is not alone in omitting these events from his narra  
tive of history. Historical amnesia is prevalent. However, despite the fact that  
these two events are commonly misunderstood, they truly represent our  
shared history. The Royal Proclamation and the subsequent Treaty of Niagara  
put forth a vision of Canada that must be remembered. As foundational con  
stitutional documents these represent a framework for political and legal  
reconciliation which to this day provides for the territorial existence of British  
North America and the subsequent legitimacy of the Canadian state. If our  
history is to be "shared," then the narrative offered by the Prime Minister on  
behalf of "all Canadians" must more accurately reflect the sharing between  
nations and the agreement reached at Niagara.
