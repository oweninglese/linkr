## Seeking multiplicity in rights, identity, and sovereignty

## in Canada

##### ABSTRACT

```
In this article, I examine how citizenship has been
legally differentiated and conceptually reconfigured
in recent treaty negotiations between the Nisga'a
First Nation, the provincial government of British
Columbia, and the Canadian federal government. The
Nisga'a have sought a form of differentiated
citizenship in Canada on the basis of rights that
flow from their relationship to their lands and their
identity as a political community. They have
challenged the state as the sole source of rights and
achieved a realignment in the relationship between
their rights as aboriginal people, Canadian
citizenship, and the Canadian state, [citizenship,
aboriginal rights, sovereignty, nation-state, Nisga'a,
Canada]
```

```
itizenship has undergone considerable transformation since its
C inception as a legal identity linked with rights and membership in
a nation-state. Globalization, migration, the displacement of per
sons, and the rise of identity politics in multicultural conditions
have all contributed to the development of transnational, postna
tional, layered, and differentiated forms of citizenship through which peo
ple simultaneously experience and claim differing sets of rights and forms
of belonging (Beiner 1995; Habermas 1992; Kymlicka and Norman 1995;
Ong 1996, 1999; Rosaldo 1994, 1997; Soysal 1994; Turner 1990). Differenti
ated citizenship refers to the legal entitlement of particular groups to dif
ferent rights in addition to the individual rights common to all citizens of a
polity (Young 1995). Although uniform rights are popularly associated with
democratic equality, scholars and activists have advocated for differenti
ated citizenship on the principle that the common rights of citizenship do
not accommodate the needs of minorities or the legal and political rights
of indigenous people (Kymlicka 1995:26; Young 1995). Indigenous peoples'
struggles with citizenship are unique in this regard. Although these peoples
have long histories of exclusion from citizenship in places such as Canada
and the United States, their political goals have always been about more
than equal access to the rights of other citizens. Their self-identification
as members of nations with rights of self-government distinguish their de
mands from those of other minorities and require legal solutions that en
able the existence, within a state, of rights in and allegiances to separate
political communities (Ramirez 2007).
In this article, I examine how one indigenous group negotiated and
defended a form of legally and conceptually differentiated citizenship in
Canada. I do this through an analysis of how the people of the Nisga'a
First Nation struggled for recognition of their aboriginal rights, including
the ability to control their membership criteria and call themselves "cit
izens of the Nisga'a nation," during recent treaty negotiations with the
federal and provincial governments. The Nisga'a have spent more than a
century seeking recognition of their aboriginal rights and title through a
treaty. Their territory lies along the Nass River valley in northwestern British
Columbia, where they historically fished, hunted, and traded the rich re
sources provided by the river and its watershed. In 1998, their negotiations

with the provincial and federal governments finally resulted  
in the Nisga'a Final Agreement, also known as the Nisga'a  
treaty. The treaty came with a CAN$190 million cash settle  
ment and makes the Nisga'a owners in fee simple of 2,  
square kilometers of land.1 It includes a guaranteed alloca  
tion of Nass River salmon, amounting to approximately 26  
percent of the total allowable catch, a set of wildlife harvest  
ing entitlements, and rights to all surface and subsurface re  
sources, including timber and minerals, on treaty lands.  
The treaty is a precedent in British Columbia because  
it is the first treaty made in that province after more than  
a century of provincial government refusal to acknowledge  
that aboriginal people had rights to land. Nationally, it is the  
first to include recognition of the right to self-government  
as a treaty right per se; this is particularly significant be  
cause treaty rights in Canada receive constitutional protec  
tion and cannot be revoked by successor governments. At  
the Nisga'a's insistence, the treaty also goes beyond the lan  
guage of "member" or "participant" used in other modern  
treaties and identifies the Nisga'a as citizens of the Nisga'a

###### nation.

Anthropologists have theorized citizenship as a status
whose criteria subaltern peoples challenge and contest as
they move toward full, rather than second-class, member
ship in states (Ramirez 2007; Rosaldo 1994, 1997). Schol
ars have also theorized citizenship as a category through
which people are disciplined into particular kinds of sub
jects even as they struggle with the terms of their belonging
(Ong 1996, 2006; Rose and Novas 2005). Nisga'a have fought
to redefine their citizenship so that it reflects their rights,
culture, and political goals in Canada. At stake is how much
they have been able to evade being disciplined by norma
tive criteria of belonging in the process (Ong 1996:738).
In the pages that follow, I argue that Nisga'a have challenged
the hegemonic norms of citizenship for aboriginal people
in Canada by refusing to equate their Canadian citizenship
with the elimination of their aboriginal rights and identi
ties. They have sought an indigenous differentiated citizen
ship on the basis of rights that flow from their relationship
to their lands and their status as a preexisting political com
munity. In this respect, they have disrupted the state as the
sole source of rights and realigned the relationship between
their rights as aboriginal people and their relationship with
the Canadian state. The Nisga'a's struggle to invest citizen
ship with multiple content and legal rights also shows, how
ever, that although citizenship is a useful focal point for sub
altern groups trying to renegotiate their relationships with
states, it is fraught with hegemonic ideals of equality linked
with universal rights and modernist subjectivities that can
impede the political aspirations of those groups. Nisga'a
have challenged the legal, political, and cultural criteria
of their participation in Canada and continue to empha
size communal values and kin-based forms of belonging in
their communities. These emphases sit, however, in uneasy

juxtaposition with the individualistic, market-oriented en
trepreneurialism by which Nisga'a citizenship and ability to
be self-governing continue to be judged.
This article is based on interviews and participant
observation I conducted in Ottawa, when the treaty bill
was being debated in the Canadian Parliament, in Vancou
ver, home to the Federal Treaty Negotiating Office, and in
the Nass River valley. In Ottawa, I met and gained familiar
ity with a small community of negotiators and bureaucrats
working to get the treaty through the House of Commons
and Senate. The Nisga'a and the provincial and federal gov
ernments each had a treaty negotiating team. The provin
cial and federal teams were made up of employees from var
ious government departments, including the Departments
of Indian Affairs and Justice, as well as external consultants
working on contract. Many members of the federal team
worked out of the Federal Treaty Negotiating Office head
quarters in Vancouver. The Nisga'a team included elected
members of the Nisga'a Tribal Council, tribal-council em
ployees, and at least one non-Nisga'a lawyer. In the Nass, I
talked with Nisga'a treaty negotiators as well as community
members, elders, and others not directly involved in treaty
negotiations. Of the approximately 5,500 Nisga'a, half live
in the villages of New Aiyansh, Girwinksihlkw, Laxgalts'ap,
and Gingolx on Nisga'a lands (see Figure 1). The rest live
and work in towns and cities outside the Nass valley, in
cluding Terrace, Prince Rupert, and Vancouver. When the
treaty came into legal effect on May 11, 2000,1 was staying
in New Aiyansh. My most recent trip to the Nass occurred in

###### Citizenship and aboriginal people in Canada:

###### A history of exclusion

```
Aboriginal people have long experienced Canadian citizen
ship as something they could only acquire by giving up their
aboriginal identities and assimilating into nonaboriginal
society (Battiste and Semaganis 2002; Johnston 1993). After
Canada became a country in 1867, politicians, administra
tors, and missionaries argued that aboriginal people had to
become "civilized" before they could take on the rights and
responsibilities of citizenship, including the franchise and
the ability to own property. The government also drafted
special legislation, known as the Indian Act, through which
it made aboriginal people wards of the state and authorized
itself to administer all aspects of their lives (Fiske 1995). It
did this on the principle that aboriginal people were not
yet competent subjects and had to be protected until they
were assimilated into mainstream society, after which they
would no longer need special oversight. When an aboriginal
person was enfranchised, he or she was removed from the
Indian Act register and ceased to have any legal status as
an Indian. Although assimilation was the stated goal, in ac
tuality, the Indian Act facilitated the ongoing supervision of

aboriginal people as a racially segregated population, mark
ing their externality from the nation and separation from
the rights and duties of Canadian citizenship.
Civil and political rights did eventually become avail
able to aboriginal people in Canada without the explicit
condition that they give up their aboriginal identity and
separate status, in part through indigenous activism and in
cremental amendments to the Indian Act. Aboriginal peo
ple continue, however, to struggle against hegemonic cri
teria of belonging linked with a normative white identity
as well as for recognition of their rights to land and self
government (Johnston 1993). This struggle has a distinc
tive history in British Columbia because of the absence of
treaties in that province. In most of the rest of Canada, the
federal government made treaties with First Nations. The
government made these treaties on the principle that abo
riginal people had a form of title, even though its main goal
was to secure the legal surrender of this title in exchange
for a set of treaty rights and small land allotments set aside
for aboriginal use. Before retiring in 1864, the first gover
nor of British Columbia made a few treaties covering a small
amount of territory on Vancouver Island but did not pursue
treaty making elsewhere in the province (Tennant 1990:19).
By the time British Columbia joined Canada in 1871, its
```

```
politicians were increasingly resistant to the idea that abo
riginal people had any rights to land at all. Settlers and
politicians alike constructed the province as an empty and
unencumbered space prior to the arrival of white civiliza
tion. They argued that lands might be set aside as reserves
for First Nations but only as "gifts" from the Crown and
not in recognition of prior aboriginal ownership (Tennant
1990:40-41).
These were the attitudes of the provincial surveyors
who landed near the former village of Gitlakdamix to cut re
serves for the Nisga'a in 1888. Israel Sgat'iin, a well-known
sim'oogit (hereditary chief) of the Wolf tribe, sent them
away at musket point. Within a few years, however, Nisga'a
lands had been surveyed, and Nisga'a up and down the river
were left with small reserves within what had been their
much larger territories. Nisga'a then spent years lobbying
federal and provincial governments for a treaty that would
recognize their right to the land they knew to be theirs by
virtue of ancestral inheritance. Other First Nations in British
Columbia were equally active in this struggle, consistently
arguing that they had never surrendered title to lands that
were now farmed, logged, and mined by nonnatives. In the
face of continued provincial denial of aboriginal title and
the steady depletion of natural resources in their territories,

the Nisga'a broke with other First Nations in the province  
and took their case to the British Columbia Supreme Court  
in 1969. The risk they took was that a negative ruling would  
make it impossible for any other First Nation to get politi  
cal recognition of aboriginal title in British Columbia, a risk  
that loomed large when they lost their case in the Supreme  
Court and then again in the British Columbia Court of Ap  
peal. In 1973, they took their case, known as Colder v. the  
Attorney General of British Columbia, to the Supreme Court  
of Canada.  
The ruling on this case was and continues to be a land  
mark in aboriginal-rights jurisprudence in Canada (Asch  
1999). Six of the seven Supreme Court justices found that  
the Nisga'a had aboriginal title in the past. Three ruled  
that this title was extinguished by the assertion of Crown  
sovereignty, and three ruled that it was not. The seventh jus  
tice cited a technicality and abstained, creating a split rul  
ing on extinguishment. The judgment in Colder affirmed  
that the Nisga'a had aboriginal title in the past and sug  
gested that aboriginal title still existed for the Nisga'a and  
others who had not surrendered any of their territorial  
rights to Canada in a treaty. The federal government quickly  
established a Comprehensive Claims Policy to deal with  
land claims where treaties had not been made, including  
British Columbia, the Yukon, Quebec, and Newfoundland  
and Labrador. All claims negotiated since then are known  
as "modern" treaties or land-claims agreements. The fed  
eral government also began negotiating with the Nisga'a.  
The province of British Columbia did not join these ne  
gotiations until 1991. By this time, conflict between First  
Nations and logging companies had become so disrup  
tive that even those politicians and businesspeople who  
had refused to acknowledge the existence of aboriginal ti  
tle in British Columbia after Colder began to realize that the  
provincial economy depended on settling aboriginal claims  
(Blackburn 2005).

###### Debating differentiated citizenship

```
After the Nisga'a and federal and provincial governments
signed the final agreement in 1998, it had to be approved
by a majority of Nisga'a voters and ratified by the provin
cial and federal legislatures. This took two years. The politi
cal parties who supported the treaty held majorities in both
governments but were vigorously opposed by other parties
who argued that the treaty threatened the legal and polit
ical unity of Canada, cost too much in land and cash, and
contradicted the democratic principle of equality before the
law (Blackburn 2007). Some First Nations argued the op
posite position, which was that the treaty did not provide
enough land, rights, or self-governing power to the Nisga'a.
In British Columbia, anxiety around the treaty was partic
ularly high because approximately fifty other treaties were
to follow. The provincial opposition party did everything
```

```
it could to block ratification, including launching a chal
lenge in the British Columbia Supreme Court, arguing that
the treaty's self-government provisions violated the distri
bution of powers allowed for in the Canadian constitution.
The Nisga'a's lawmaking and self-governing authority, in
cluding authority over citizenship, were also heated issues
at the federal level. The treaty refers to Nisga'a "citizens,"
defines a Nisga'a citizen as "a citizen of the Nisga'a Nation
as determined by Nisga'a law," and sets out criteria of en
rollment that are based on ancestry (Canada et al. 1998:10).
In the Senate, this terminology and the powers the Nisga'a
would have to control their citizenship criteria served as an
entry point for discussion about the meaning of citizenship
and the merits of a common versus a differentiated one for
national identity, sovereignty, equality, and social cohesion.
Bills are first introduced in the Senate chamber and
then sent to committees, where senators question wit
nesses on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed
legislation. They are then returned to the Senate for final de
bate and vote. Senators ultimately passed the treaty bill but
not without worrying that the treaty would weaken Canada
by foregrounding a heterogeneity in rights, sentiments, and
political identification that would make the country politi
cally less stable and conceptually more difficult to imagine.
One senator wondered why the words citizen and citizen
ship had to be used at all, arguing that they "give the im
pression that native people are leaving the country or some
how have different or special rights that may supersede the
rights of the rest of us." In the Senate Committee on Abo
riginal Affairs, this senator opined that Canadians "want to
be equal" and "to be treated fairly and justly in this land.
There is the feeling that 'citizen' conjures up some special
rights in a way that diminishes others in the citizenship cat
egory. If they are citizens of Nisga'a, are they still citizens
of Canada? That is what I am being asked."3 Others worried
the treaty created a form of dual citizenship that would frag
ment the political cohesion and social unity a common cit
izenship should foster. People "are struggling to find some
unity in Canada" one senator said, in a veiled reference to
the threat of Quebec secession. "We rally around symbols
of citizenship."4 Another described citizenship as the coun
try's highest honor and cautioned against introducing any
duality into a term of such legal and symbolic significance.
A nonaboriginal witness from a right-wing think tank sim
ilarly argued that aboriginal people should not have dif
ferent rights than other Canadians because this "will work
against concepts of Canadian citizenship for the polity as a
whole" and "undermine all common Canadian citizenship
```

```
As citizens of the Nisga'a nation, Nisga'a do have "dif
ferent or special rights" that other Canadians do not, in
cluding rights to self-government and land. This is the point
of differentiated citizenship for aboriginal people; the dif
ferentiation rests on the principle that aboriginal rights are

inherent and temporally prior to the rights of nonaborigi  
nal Canadians. The Nisga'a's pursuit of this differentiation  
and their use of the word citizen to label themselves chal  
lenge the public expectation that citizenship means equal  
rights; they also challenge the expectation that universality  
in rights is part of the social contract whereby citizens have  
equal entitlements and responsibilities in a shared or com  
mon community (Ignatieff 1995:70; Ong 2006). Senators are  
clearly well aware of this expectation. From the perspective  
of the Nisga'a, however, the notion that citizenship means  
equality in rights and treatment masks their historical ex  
periences of discrimination, both before and after they at  
tained the formal rights of Canadian citizenship. In their  
experience, equality and inclusion in Canada have been  
most notable in their absence, and their appropriation of  
the term citizen involves a critique of such exclusions. Their  
challenge is to keep and build on the word and some of what  
it stands for in liberal political theory while investing citi  
zenship with meaning specific to an indigenous politics and  
indigenous resistance.  
The Nisga'a who testified to the Senate committee ar  
gued that citizen was the best word to signal their affilia  
tion with the political community that is the Nisga'a nation.  
They did not deny that the treaty meant they had different  
rights but hastened to say that they sought a differentiated  
citizenship within Canada. Many indigenous people think  
of themselves as dual citizens in ways that combine belong  
ing to their aboriginal nations and the larger states in which  
they live (Biolsi 2005:251; Ramirez 2004:401). In the com  
mittee hearings one Nisga'a negotiator said,

```
We do not understand why anyone would object to the
use of the term "citizen" to refer to the members of the
Nisga'a nation. No doubt, if we had agreed to describe
ourselves merely as members there would have been
little or no objection. We believe that the correct word
to describe someone who belongs to a nation is "citi
zen." We wish to affirm, not deny, our existence as the
Nisga'a nation, a nation that is within Canada.
```

```
Their lawyer added to this argument, saying that to deny
the Nisga'a the ability to use citizen was to deny "their ex
istence as a nation, as a nation within Canada." At stake,
he said, was not dual citizenship in the international-law
sense but, rather, recognition that the Nisga'a belonged to
a unique form of political community. He and others ex
plained that, although members belonged to voluntary or
ganizations, like clubs and even the Senate itself, this did
not suggest a political identity in the way that citizen did.
The Indian Act also identifies aboriginal people as "mem
bers" of bands, and Nisga'a refused to repeat this terminol
ogy. "Band member," one negotiator told me, "meant there's
no such thing as self-definition. You were defined by legis
```

```
lation, which was the Indian Act. It relegated you to status
as a member of a band in a confined reserve."
Nisga'a are drawing heavily on the linkage in lib
eral theory between citizenship and the modern nation
state to say that they were politically independent, self
governing people prior to the arrival of settlers (Hall and
Held 1989:173; Turner 1993:7). They are building on a term
of Western, rather than indigenous, political theory to make
an argument about their status as a nation. They are also in
vesting citizen with the significance of the relationship be
tween their rights and territory. When I asked a Nisga'a ne
gotiator why they had insisted on citizen, he said, ruefully,
that this really got the right-wingers going but that "the self
description as citizens is really a declaration that we've al
ways had this inherent connection to our land." There was
no other term to use "to make that connection." He spoke
of how the huwilp (sing, wilp), the matrilineal kin groups
to which all Nisga'a belong, are based on and embody an
cestral rights to territory that are distinct from Western
forms of property ownership. Aboriginal scholar John Bor
rows (1999:80) has called indigenous citizenship "landed
citizenship" to capture the importance of land to aborig
inal peoples' understanding of their rights and identity
(see Figure 2). In this respect, the citizenship Nisga'a claim
is different from the deterritorialized citizenships that are
linked with globalization and contemporary neoliberalism

(Delanty 2000:2; Falk 2000; Ong 2006). Nisga'a introduce  
duality into Canadian citizenship but do not speak of thin,  
flexible, or postnational attachments that can be strategi  
cally deployed but, rather, of an identity and rights rooted  
in territory (Lee 2006). In New Aiyansh, a woman who had  
returned to Nisga'a territory after some years away affirmed  
this a priori relationship to the land when she said, "I'm  
a Nisga'a citizen first before I'm a Canadian citizen. We've  
known all along that we belong here, in this place. If they  
want to call this country where we are Canada, then I'm also  
a Canadian citizen."  
Citizenship, nationhood, and sovereignty are deeply in  
tertwined and their contemporary rearticulations a focus of  
much scholarly inquiry (e.g., Hansen and Stepputat 2005;  
Ong 2006). Whereas Nisga'a link their right to call them  
selves "citizens" with their status as a nation, politicians  
wondered if the presence of a group of people with separate  
rights and calling themselves "citizens of the Nisga'a nation"  
challenged Canada's sovereignty. Treaty negotiators reas  
sured everyone who asked that the treaty did not weaken  
the federal government's authority over Canadian citizen  
ship or create an uncontrollable legal duality in the state.  
One told the Senate committee that he only agreed to the  
word citizen "because of how it is defined in the treaty and  
because all of the rights that accrue to such a person are  
specifically stated in the treaty and nothing exists outside  
of it." He insisted that the powers the Nisga'a have over  
their citizenship have nothing to do with the power to grant  
Canadian citizenship and that nothing about Nisga'a citi  
zenship produced dual citizenship in Canada. As he said,  
"If someone comes to Canada legally and goes onto Nisga'a  
lands and is made a citizen, whatever the federal law is  
with respect to that person's ability to remain in Canada re  
mains the law under which he or she is governed. That per  
son has no special rights with respect to Canadian citizen  
ship as a result of that." Nisga'a citizenship, he explained,  
"relates to their lands, their assets, and living within their  
territory."  
Others were more categorical that Nisga'a citizenship  
did not threaten Canadian sovereignty. One employee in  
the federal Department of Indian Affairs responded to my  
queries about citizenship by saying, "They can call them,  
you know, coffee cups, but they called them Nisga'a citi  
zens." Flipping through the treaty, she explained, "It says  
somewhere in here that this is not about nationhood\_It's  
not about the determination of citizenship in Canada, and  
the Nisga'a citizens are still citizens of Canada as well.  
They're just also Nisga'a citizens, it's not really a dual pass  
port situation, because a passport, you need a passport  
to a nation, like to a sovereign nation, and this is not  
about sovereignty." A member of the federal negotiating  
team likewise told me that, although member would have  
saved them a lot of trouble, citizen did not mean much  
more than that. He explained that there are limitations

```
to the lawmaking authority Nisga'a will have over their
citizenship:
```

```
They can't grant passports or entry into or out of
Canada or create citizens or take citizenship away
from anybody?Canadian citizenship. They can't do
any of that. The word that's used in the Indian Act
is member, and that's one significant reason why the
Nisga'a, and why we accepted, moving to a different
language_And so citizen was used. And I don't know
if it was a good use or bad use, I suppose it's academic at
this point because that's what it is. But it doesn't mean
more than if we had used the word member_It's used
in a way that does not in any way imply sovereignty.
```

###### Nisga'a do not see citizen as implying this much

```
sovereignty either, but they do see the term as doing more
than these comments suggest. Citizenship involves "a po
litical identity, an expression of one's membership in a po
litical community" as well as a set of rights (Kymlicka and
Norman 1995:301). Nisga'a are using citizenship to signal
both of these things, insisting that they have rights as citi
zens of the Nisga'a nation not because of the racialized dif
ference generated by the state and linked, formerly, with
their exclusion but because they belong to a previously ex
isting political community that holds inherent or extracon
stitutional rights (Wilkins and Lomawaima 2001). Nisga'a's
insistence on these rights and the ability to decide who gets
access to them challenges hegemonic practices that locate
citizenship in rights that are granted or denied by the state
(Gordillo 2006:167). The converse argument, that all Cana
dians should have the same rights and be governed by the
same laws, presumes that Canadians have rights that flow
only from their status as citizens of Canada.
The treaty does not create the Nisga'a as sovereigns but
it does produce a novel kind of political space in Canada
(Biolsi 2005). Nisga'a have decision and lawmaking power
over their lands, resources, and cash assets. They do not
have exclusive jurisdiction, but they do have paramount
jurisdiction?meaning their laws trump federal or provin
cial laws?in areas relating to Nisga'a government, citizen
ship, language, and culture. Their self-governing powers
make them a unique configuration; they are more than a
municipality but less than a province. They are an "abo
riginal government," possibly best described as sui generis,
a thing in itself.10 Their right of self-government is written
into the treaty and thereby constitutionally recognized as
an aboriginal right. In treaty and land claims negotiations
before the Nisga'a Final Agreement, the federal government
insisted that self-government be negotiated in so-called
side agreements. This meant that the self-governing powers
of a First Nation were not part of the final treaty, did not re
ceive constitutional protection, and provided the First Na
tion with a delegated form of authority akin to a municipal
ity. First Nations have been critical of the municipal model

of government for some time; municipalities have jurisdic
tional authority that is delegated by provincial or federal
governments and that can be changed or taken back at any
time. Nisga'a negotiators would not accept self-government
as a side agreement to the treaty because this would leave
them in a similarly vulnerable position and because they
refused to accept that their right to self-government could
be "given" or "loaned" to them by the Crown, as delegated
authority implies.

The treaty's citizenship criteria distinguish between peo
ple who live on Nisga'a lands and are Nisga'a citizens and
those who may live on Nisga'a lands but may not qual
ify as Nisga'a citizens. Only Nisga'a citizens are entitled
to the treaty rights, to fish, for example, or to participate
in self-government by voting in Nisga'a elections. Crit
ics argued that the treaty was a set of race-based rights
and railed against the establishment of ethnic enclaves on
Canadian soil. Some senators were uncomfortable with the
ethical and political implications of having a governing en
tity within Canada that did not practice universal citizen
ship. How, they asked, could the Senate sanction the for
mation of a government that would base its membership,
and the ability to vote, on ancestry? Some compared the
use of ancestral or "birthright" criteria for Nisga'a citizen
ship with the government's former use of blood to define
who was an Indian. Until 1951, an Indian in Canada was
"any male person of Indian blood reputed to belong to
a particular band," "any child of such person," and "any
woman who is or was lawfully married to such person"
(Jamieson 1978:43). Referring to the possibility that the
Nisga'a could embarrass the state by repeating its previ
ous legal reification of race through blood, one senator
noted that the Indian Act began "a racial blood defini
tion" but that now it was possible to have "this unbeliev
able paradox that the reprehensible notion of blood in the
definition of the Indian Act, which was European and for
eign to the aboriginals, may somehow continue on in this
treaty."
Blood has a long history in the racialization of aborig
inal people in North America but is not a criterion for cit
izenship in the Nisga'a nation (cf. Biolsi 1995; Halualani
2001). Enrollment in the Nisga'a nation and access to the
treaty rights does, however, depend on ancestry. A person
may be enrolled, according to the treaty, if he or she can
show that his or her mother was Nisga'a and belonged to
one of the four Nisga'a pdeek, or tribes. Nisga'a are matri
lineal in their kinship reckoning. For enrollment purposes, a
person's qualifying Nisga'a mother can be on either the ma
ternal or paternal side and as far back as five generations.
A person may also be enrolled if adopted by a Nisga'a as a
```

```
child, even if the person is not aboriginal. A person who is
a descendant of either of these categories is eligible for en
rollment. Lastly, a person may qualify for enrollment if he
or she marries a Nisga'a, is aboriginal, and has been cultur
ally adopted according to Nisga'a cultural adoption proto
cols. A nonaboriginal person who marries a Nisga'a and is
culturally adopted does not qualify for enrollment and cit
izenship; such persons cannot vote and have no access to
the treaty rights. Nonaboriginal people who live on Nisga'a
lands for short periods, such as schoolteachers or police of
ficers, cannot become Nisga'a citizens and cannot vote in
Nisga'a elections.
Nisga'a defended the link between matrilineal ancestry
and citizenship as culturally appropriate and a positive act
of self-government. The ability to determine membership is
fundamental to indigenous self-determination, particularly
because settler governments have so long arrogated this re
sponsibility to themselves (Jaimes 1992). A tribal-council
employee who worked on the citizenship criteria explained
that they were crafted to reflect Nisga'a cultural practices
and to be as distinct from Indian Act definitions as pos
sible, meaning the Indian Act's former blood requirement
and its emphasis on tracing Indian status through men. Un
til 1985 aboriginal women in Canada who married nona
boriginal men lost their legal status as Indians, as did their
children, whereas nonaboriginal women who married In
dian men acquired Indian status (Jamieson 1977). Now, as
this Nisga'a individual explained, "Nisga'a criteria for en
rolment begins with a person's mother," so even if a person's
mother married a non-Nisga'a, that person would still be
entitled to enroll. He said this "corrects some hardships" but
"also... make[s] sure that what happened with the Indian
Act never happens again."
It is not surprising that senators read ancestry as
blood, given the taken-for-grantedness of blood in Anglo
American kinship reckoning and the linkage governments
have made between blood quantum and Indian identity
in the law (Turner Strong and Van Winkle 1996). Senators
and witnesses who spoke to the committee also worried
that the ancestral linkage used in the citizenship criteria
precluded universality in rights within the Nisga'a nation.
What began as a concern about blood became a discus
sion about whether the Nisga'a really grasped the commit
ment to equality, minority rights, and democratic principles
that citizenship is supposed to entail. A witness from the
organization Citizens Voice on Native Claims argued that
the "closed membership society" the Nisga'a wanted went
against the grain of the last two centuries of evolution in
Western political thought,12 and the spokesperson from the
conservative think tank cited "the evidence of history and
all logic and reason and the development of western polit
ical thought" to critique the treaty's membership criteria.
Senator Grafstein, a Liberal senator from Ontario, was par
ticularly vocal on this issue. He linked universal citizenship

rights with the principles of modern democracy in a way  
that questioned the Nisga'a's commitment to the latter. He  
asked the Nisga'a why they did not provide "something that  
we consider to be important in so-called European style of  
governance, and that is to establish or entrench minority  
rights within the institutions."14 Grafstein raised the twin  
specters of tribalism and ethnic primordialism, asking if  
nonuniversal citizenship is "the vision we want for a united  
Canada with the globe shrinking in the twenty-first century?  
We have yet to learn the bitter lessons of the twentieth cen  
tury respecting the clash between ethnicity on the one hand  
and open citizenship on the other."15 He said the Nisga'a  
seem to have wanted to move from a purely "tribal sys  
tem" to a democratic one but that, with respect to minority  
rights, they did not go all the way.16 "A citizen," he declared,  
"should be a person, without qualification. If he meets an  
objective standard, he is entitled to vote\_That is what cit  
izenship is\_In the Nisga'a treaty," however, "people are  
excluded. You cannot become a Nisga'a citizen... unless  
you are born into the tribe. This sets up ... a conflicting no  
tion of citizenship."  
Nisga'a and federal and provincial negotiators ex  
plained that they wanted to safeguard the treaty assets?  
the land, cash, trees, and fish?for the use and benefit of  
the Nisga'a. If nonaboriginal people could become citi  
zens and vote in Nisga'a elections, they could influence the  
management and distribution of those assets. Negotiators  
also argued that the lawmaking authority of Nisga'a gov  
ernment pertains mostly to Nisga'a citizens, so that non  
aboriginal people living on Nisga'a lands are not actually  
governed very much by the Nisga'a. Most significantly, if  
nonaboriginal people could enroll under the treaty and be  
Nisga'a citizens, they would then have access to the treaty  
rights of the Nisga'a people, rights that are a subset of the  
aboriginal rights recognized and protected in section 35 of  
the Canadian constitution. These rights come from aborigi  
nal peoples' presence as self-governing communities before  
Canada became a country; they are not the universal enti  
tlements of all Canadians (Borrows 2001). When the presi  
dent of the Nisga'a Tribal Council defended the particularity  
of Nisga'a rights, he reflected the conviction that the treaty  
rights and assets are the ancestral inheritance of the Nisga'a  
people. Using an idiom of kinship that did not resonate well  
in the Senate, he said,

```
By way of comparison, would any one of you seated
across the table in this room allow strangers or individ
uals who stay with you temporarily to decide how your
family's internal assets would be handled? Would you
do that? That is the problem that faces us: people who
come into our communities maybe for a year, two years
or three years and then they are gone_Would you al
low someone to handle your family's personal assets? I
do not think so.
```

```
Senator Grafstein's response to this is illustrative: He
took issue with the family analogy, and he suggested that
the assets in question come from Canada. "These are not
family assets," he said. "These are public assets that are
held in trust as fiduciaries. What I am talking about here is
the right of a citizen to fully participate and vote on mat
ters affecting his life and the area in which he chooses to
reside_The right to vote goes to the heart of any right
to participate in a civic society."19 Grafstein wondered why,
"having accepted the European notion that you get nation
hood or sovereignty and, with that, you get citizenship, then
why would you not take the next step which is, under the
European thesis, the minority rights entailed in citizenship?
In other words, why... take two-thirds of the package and
not the last third of the package?"20 Others emphasized
the importance of the right to vote to democratic values,
calling it "almost biblical" and something "embedded in
us." Anything "that discounts that value or blocks it," one
witness argued, "is amongst everything else, unconstitu
tional."21 The representative from Citizens Voice on Native
Claims said that the treaty "establishes a right to vote based
on race" and asked how "this racially based right to vote"
could "be reconciled with the concept that all Canadians are
equal?"
At the point of almost achieving the treaty, the Nisga'a
found themselves being criticized for not being modern
enough. Implicit in the canonical narrative of moderniza
tion is evolution up and away from social groupings and
relationships built around kin, custom, or tribe toward au
tonomy, individualism, and relationships based on modern
legal forms, of which contract is preeminent (Coombe 1998;
Perry 1995:561; Turner 1993). Senator Grafstein's reference
to "tribal systems" and his urging of the Nisga'a to go that
"next step" suggest these distinctions. In this trajectory, the
modern citizen emerges as "an abstract political subject no
longer formally confined by the particularities of birth, eth
nicity or gender" (Turner 1990:194). Attachments based on
blood, language, or religion are to be replaced by an enlight
enment model of modern political participation based "on
the idea of an educated, post-ethnic, calculating individual,
subsisting on the workings of the free market and partici
pating in a genuine civil society" (Appadurai 1996:142-143).
This placement of the Nisga'a on the margins of moder
nity is not new but, rather, has long been made in con
junction with the criteria of citizenship and belonging for
Nisga'a and other First Nations in Canada. Indeed, it has
corresponded with the state's previous exclusion of abo
riginal people from citizenship. The Senate debate was an
other instance in the long conversation about Nisga'a peo
ple's suitability as Canadian citizens. It took the form it did
because, in their defense of ancestral membership criteria,
the Nisga'a suggest that they have not given up the kinds of
tribal affiliations that originally marked them as not mod
ern, not yet ready for Canadian citizenship and in need of

assimilation. Although the federal government has repudi
ated its former policy of assimilation, there remains an ex
pectation that, to be a citizen, one must be recognizably
"modern" in the sense of understanding the importance
of equality, the rule of law, and upholding the values of
democratic society (Ignatieff 1995:55). While Nisga'a defend
their right to control their citizenship criteria as an empow
ering act of self-government, they insist on enacting self
government in ways that complicate the presumed asso
ciation between evolved, democratic forms of governance
and the universality in rights that is supposed to replace
particularism (Ignatieff 1995; Young 1995). For their polit
ical opponents, this casts doubt on their capacity for self
government and the suitability of the form of citizenship
they seek within Canada.
```

###### Citizenship and self-government

```
During the committee hearings, one senator asked if the
Nisga'a had a word for citizen that could be used instead of
the symbolically loaded English one. She speculated that, if
there was such a word, there also must be a set of rights and
responsibilities that flowed from it.23 In response, the presi
dent of the Nisga'a Tribal Council said,
```

```
It is important for the committee and the rest of the
honorable senators who are not present to recognize
very clearly that every citizen of our nation today be
longs to one of the four major crests that we hold. There
is no Nisga'a today that is born who does not belong to
one of these four groupings of clans. Everyone fits into
our structure. There is no individual standing off to one
side who has nowhere to go. You belong. You are born
into a lineage. You are born into our nation.
```

```
The president did not give an answer about indi
vidual rights but about belonging tied to kinship and
birth. All Nisga'a are members of one of four exoga
mous pdeek, also called "tribes," including Ganada (Raven
Frog), Laxgibuu (Wolf-Bear), Gisk'aast (Killerwhale-Owl),
and Laxsgiik (Eagle-Beaver). The pdeek are identified by
their two major crests and constitute the four corner posts
of the Nisga'a nation. Each one is composed of matri
lineally defined huwilp, or houses. Members of a pdeek
are descended from a common ancestor but cannot trace
their descent to one woman; members of a wilp, however,
can. A wilp is named after its highest-ranking sim'oogit,
or hereditary chief. Children belong to the wilp of their
mother and have access to territories, known as ango'oskws,
through this matrilineal affiliation. They also have rights to
ango'oskws through their father, who belongs to a different
wilp and pdeek. A person's father's wilp is that person's wilk
silaks. People in the same wilksilaks perform specific ser
vices for one another throughout life and make important

```
contributions to feasts at one another's marriage and death.
In the past, if someone wanted to pass through or hunt, fish,
or collect berries on the ango'oskw of another wilp, that per
son had to ask permission of the sim'oogit. If the person did
not and was caught, he or she could be killed or taken into
slavery. This seldom happened because people were, on the
whole, taught to respect the laws governing trespass and ac
cess to territories. People who had no relatives and did not
know their origins were way'aayin, meaning "not whole"
or "not healed," because they had no one to look after
them.
In her analysis of cultural citizenship, Aiwha Ong asks
"if a minority group can escape the cultural inscription of
state power and other forms of regulation that define modes
of belonging within states" (1996:738). Ong theorizes cul
tural citizenship as a disciplinary process that involves mak
ing people into particular kinds of subjects within nation
states. Others have formulated cultural citizenship as the
attempt by minorities to bring their cultural difference into
their participation in mainstream society and institutions
(Rosaldo 1994, 1997). Nisga'a have resisted much of the in
dividualizing thrust of state assimilation policies and invest
their citizenship in the Nisga'a nation, and, therefore, their
citizenship in Canada, with social content that has long
been considered inimical to the attributes of modern citi
zenship. Although they have been subjected to disciplinary
intervention on the part of state and church, they continue
to value forms of personhood that emphasize kin-based so
cial obligations and collective responsibilities. Nisga'a dis
tinguish this collectivism from the individualism of non
Nisga'a, describing the white world, in particular, as cold
and lacking support. "It's harder to be a white person," one
man said to me. "The support is not there." He explained
how, for him,
```

```
ultimately what it comes down to is, I'm not by myself.
I saw this especially when my uncle died. There was
a lot of fear when he passed away, because all his re
sponsibilities were ours now.... But when I went to our
tribal feast and I saw the strength of our house, I knew I
wasn't by myself. Halfway through, I knew it was going
to be okay. We had lost a significant member but what
he taught us was there.
```

```
After the Senate debate was over, I attended a stone
moving feast in New Aiyansh. Traditionally, a stone-moving
feast is held one year after a person's death. It marks the
movement of the headstone from display in front of the
house of a relative to the actual gravesite. It is also usually
the time when the deceased's Nisga'a name is passed on
to a successor. High-ranking names are the property of the
wilp and are linked with rights to territory as well as crests,
songs, and dances. The host wilp, in this case, the wilksi
laks of the person taking on the name, conducts a range

of business during the feast, including giving other names,  
settling financial accounts, and, occasionally, performing a  
cultural adoption, known as a "taking in." At the feast I at  
tended, elders from the hosting wilp called a white man who  
worked for the Nisga'a Tribal Council to the front of the hall  
to take him into their wilp and pdeek. When I asked a se  
nior woman about the procedure and its significance, she  
said the person being taken in really wanted to be involved  
in the community and that, to do so, he had to become part  
of the tribal system. Once this happens, she explained, "you  
are part of an extended family. You have obligations to them  
and share the good times and the sad times. You have to  
be there for the feasts, doing your part." People who have  
been taken in and failed in their obligations can be publicly  
censured, and Nisga'a complained that many nonaborigi  
nal people do not understand how hard it is to fulfill the du  
ties of this particular kind of citizenship.  
At the same time that Nisga'a conduct lives that are  
framed by the obligations that kinship and marriage pro  
duce within and across huwilp and pdeek, they often talk  
about what they have lost as a result of state- and church  
sponsored attempts to assimilate them. In so doing, they  
critically reflect on their production as unfit citizens, ac  
cording to both their standards and those of the dominant  
society, by the state apparatuses that have regulated their  
lives. When Nisga'a talked about their parents' and grand  
parents' generations, they described lives of hard work, so  
cial responsibility, and interdependence within the frame  
work of the wilp and pdeek and linked this way of life with  
their former practice of self-government. They complained  
that the younger generations have become too dependent  
on government assistance. Most blamed the Indian Act,  
which dates to 1876, and the introduction of welfare in the  
1950s for their loss of self-reliance, self-government, and in  
terdependence, saying that, when welfare was brought in,  
the elders warned them that people would forget how to  
work. People reserved their most contemptuous comments  
for the Indian Act, describing it as suffocating, oppressive,  
destructive, archaic, and regressive and as something that  
restricted their movement and prescribed what they had  
to do on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. "Over time,"  
one woman said, "we became helpless," so that "when the  
treaty came about and the reality was there for us to be self  
governing, lo and behold, our people are a dependent peo  
ple." She and others spoke of being stuck in an Indian Act  
mentality and of needing to deprogram themselves so they  
could become "healthy, thinking people" again.  
This talk of dependency is significant because depen  
dency is generally cast as antithetical to the responsibili  
ties of citizenship in capitalist societies (Fraser and Gor  
don 1997). Those who make claims on the state are judged  
negatively in relation to those who manage to pull them  
selves up by their bootstraps. This is not new, but in the  
current ascendancy of neoliberalism, good citizenship is in

```
creasingly defined as the duty of individuals "to reduce their
burden on society," to maximize their individual capital
and be "entrepreneurs of themselves" (Ong 1996:739). How
ever, although Nisga'a's commentary on their loss of self
reliance brings them into proximity with neoliberal norms
of citizenship?standards by which they have been and
continue to be adversely judged?they are not just recapitu
lating a neoliberal rationality in their self-critique. They are
commenting on the dilemmas facing them in light of their
disciplining out of interdependence and into dependency
and on the desirability of the market-oriented, individual
istic subjectivity that continues to have disciplinary force,
ideologically as well structurally. Nisga'a want to generate
wealth on their lands and reduce the economic impover
ishment in their communities at the same time that they
challenge the norms of wealth and poverty that are domi
nant in nonaboriginal society, and they worry about what
kind of cultural compromises they will have to make given
that they are surrounded by nonaboriginal society and in
stitutions. Why, Nisga'a have recently asked me, do we con
tinue to be measured by an external yardstick? The treaty
has brought them into discussion not only about eligibil
ity for citizenship but also about what their internal norms
of citizenship behavior should be; these debates take place
around issues such as whether to move into a system of
fee-simple property ownership in their villages, how non
Nisga'a should behave to be taken in, and how to stimulate
economic development. At issue is the extent to which, at
the point of achieving aboriginal self-government, Nisga'a
are required to govern themselves in the neoliberal sense of
being self-regulating, self-disciplining individuals.
```

##### Conclusion

```
The Nisga'a's pursuit of differentiated citizenship has im
portant implications for the study of citizenship as a place
from which to claim rights, responsibilities, and identities
in liberal democracies. This is because Nisga'a have experi
enced both coercive exclusion and coercive inclusion in and
around the category of "citizen" and because of their politi
cal objectives. In Canada, aboriginal people were denied the
civil, political, and social rights of other Canadians because
they were seen as insufficiently civilized, and governments
and churches worked to transform them into the kind of in
dividuals who could become citizens. Their contemporary
struggles to assert citizenship in their indigenous nations
and to define if and how to be citizens of the states they live
in are inseparable from these histories. That aboriginal peo
ple assert rights to self-government and self-determination
makes their legal and political goals distinct from those of
other minorities. It also makes their claims more challeng
ing to states, heightening what is at stake in the reconfigu
ration of the rights, identities, and governing authority con
nected with citizenship.

American Ethnologist Volume 36 Number 1 February 2009

At the Senate hearings, one Nisga'a negotiator said,  
"The word citizen does not have a single fixed meaning  
in every context in which it is properly used."25 Stuart  
Hall and David Held make a similar point when they write  
that citizenship, "like all key contested political concepts  
of our time... can be appropriated within very different  
political discourses and articulated to very different polit  
ical positions" (1989:174). Nisga'a have insisted that they  
are citizens of Canada through their citizenship in the  
Nisga'a nation, using the words citizen and nation purpose  
fully to signal that they are not just one more element in  
Canada's multicultural mosaic. Although they have strug  
gled for cultural citizenship as the right to be culturally dif  
ferent while belonging to Canadian society (Rosaldo 1994),  
they have also insisted on a legally differentiated citizen  
ship on the basis of their inherent rights as aboriginal peo  
ple (Young 1995). Nisga'a have used "citizen" and "nation"  
as tools of identity and struggle in ways that have chal  
lenged the normative force of these concepts; they have  
also disrupted the relationship between citizenship, nation  
hood, and sovereignty. They have done this without link  
ing either citizenship or nationhood to sovereignty in its  
strongest sense, and it is clear that Nisga'a faced consider  
able limitations in this regard. The treaty detaches Nisga'a  
nationhood from sovereignty but it also means that Cana  
dian sovereignty is not linked, monolithically, to an undif  
ferentiated citizenry, because Nisga'a bring their rights as  
Nisga'a citizens into their rights as Canadian citizens.  
It is in the interest of aboriginal people to explore  
all possible reconfigurations of sovereignty and the spaces  
within it. Nisga'a have created a novel political space within  
Canada. In the nature of its jurisdiction and source of au  
thority, it is unlike a municipal, provincial, or federal order  
of government. Their government is distinct and changes  
the relationship they have with the Canadian state, and  
Nisga'a welcome their transition from being an Indian Act  
band to a nation with governmental decision-making abil  
ities that do not require oversight from the Department of  
Indian Affairs. They rightly celebrate autonomy and self  
government but are faced with the difficulty of what that  
can and should look like now that the treaty is in place.  
They do this while elements of citizenship, sovereignty, and  
identity are disarticulated and recombined in multiple con  
texts around the globe. What it is to be self-governing cit  
izens of the Nisga'a nation will emerge in ongoing contes  
tation and struggle as Nisga'a live the rights the treaty now  
protects.

23. There is no direct translation for citizen. A Nisga'a language  
    teacher suggested that hligadihl Nisga'a?meaning "the people of  
    the Nisga'a," or "the Nisga'a people"?might work, but she could  
    not think of anything "that says citizen." She said, in the past, what  
    people were called depended on where they lived on the Nass River.
