Tucker

With the inintroduction
ofas part
section
35 offramework
the Constitution
Act, 1982,' Canada recognized
1990, the duty to consult
of the justification
allowing for the
infringements of Aboriginal rights.2 The Supreme Court of Canada then went on to establish,
in 2004, the duty to consult and, if appropriate, accommodate Aboriginal groups when the
Crown undertakes an action or decision that could adversely affect their rights. This duty
is triggered even if the adverse effect on their rights is not yet proven.3 This latter duty is
grounded in the longstanding, though oft neglected, principle of the honour of the Crown.4
In fact, this duty breathed new life into this principle, and affirmed that there is a special
relationship between the Crown and Aboriginal peoples.5 Much litigation has followed this
recognition, and now the duty to consult and accommodate is a key component of Aboriginal
law. While Chief Justice Lamer recognized that Aboriginal law generally is a complex and
rapidly evolving area of the law,6 the field of consultation and accommodation is particularly
so. Aboriginal groups are driving this evolution, challenging the courts to grapple with new
circumstances in novel settings.

1. BACKGROUND

1.1 Duty to Consult and Accommodate

As noted above, the source of the duty to consult and accommodate is the honour of t

Crown, which is always at stake in the Crowns dealings with Aboriginal peoples.12 As explain
by Chief Justice McLachlin, this principle "is not a mere incantation, but rather a core precep
that finds its application in concrete practices."13 This core precept reflects an important part
Canadian history, namely that Crown sovereignty over the land that now constitutes Cana

did not occur as a result of conquest.14 In accordance with the Royal Proclamation, 176

which is presently celebrating its 250th anniversary, the Crown recognized the existing use an
occupation of the lands and resources by Aboriginal peoples and, on these grounds, the nee
to conclude treaties prior to lawful European settlement on the land.15

i.2 Bilateral Investment Agreement
The investment agreement under scrutiny in the Hupacasath decision is the Agreement between
the Government of Canada and the Government ofthe People's Republic of China for the Promotion
and Reciprocal Protection of Investments ("CCFIPPA").27 CCFIPPA was signed in Vladivostok,

Russia, on September 9, 2012.28 It is one of the latest in a series of Foreign Investment
Promotion and Protection Agreements ("FIPA"s) signed by Canada, modeled on the invest

ment chapter of the North American Free Trade Agreement Between the Government of Canada,
the Government of Mexico and the Government of the United States ("NAFTA").29 Canada has

signed approximately twenty-four such agreements since 1993. However, previous FIPAs were
entered into with countries with minimal investment in Canada, such as Latvia, Peru, Jordan,

and Trinidad and Tobago.30 CCFIPPA is unique in that it was entered into with China, a
major economic world player with increasing investment in Canada. As the court noted in
Hupacasath, "Chinese investment in Canada increased from approximately $228 million in

2003 to over $12 billion in 2009."31 According to recent figures, Chinese investment has

plunged, prompting the Governor-General, and the ministers of trade, of foreign affairs, and
of natural resources to head to China in order to drum up business and to increase investment
flows.32

Despite being the most significant bilateral investment agreement Canada has ever signed,
CCFIPPA has received remarkably little attention. This is in sharp contrast to the reaction of

Canadians to NAFTAs investment chapter. This silence is significant given that certain provi

sions in CCFIPPA are considerably more stringent than comparable provisions in NAFTA.
For example, once it comes into force, CCFIPPA will remain in force for at least fifteen years.
Thereafter, either party may terminate the agreement with a year's notice, but the investments

2. preventing it from "negotiating a treaty to protect its rights" to govern its lands,
resources, and habitat in the best interest of the Hupacasath people;

3. subjecting it to international trade and investment law, which does not respect con
stitutionally enshrined Aboriginal rights, in the event of resource use disputes with
Chinese investors;
4. causing the federal and provincial governments to be less inclined to protect its rights

and title due to the potentially "significant damage claims" that could be awarded
against it; and

5. causing the federal government and courts to be influenced by the rights of Chinese
investors and potential damages claims, in determining whether reasonable accom
modation has occurred.50
HFN argued that these potential negative effects would cause a "chilling effect" in the
Canadian governments willingness to setde HFN's claims.51 Specifically, the protective provi
sions in CCFIPPA could influence the willingness of the government to allow for the protection

of lands and resources for fear of being hit with an adverse arbitral award.52 Vernon MacKay,
Crown witness from the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, admitted that

in "developing regulatory or other policy initiatives, including measures that may be taken to

accommodate Aboriginal peoples, the responsible government is strongly advised to consult
with the governments Trade Law Bureau to ensure that the obligations or measures in question
are consistent with Canada's international trade and investment obligations."53
2.2 Application of Three-Part Test

Chief Justice Crampton of the Federal Court of Canada determined that the first two par

of the duty to consult test were easily satisfied. Firsdy, given the existence of the BC treaty

process negotiations, the Crown unquestionably has knowledge of HFN's asserted Aborigina

rights.54 Secondly, there is clearly a contemplated Crown conduct, namely the intent to rati

49 The original relief also included a request for an order restraining the government from sending Chin

the letter signaling the completion of the domestic review process, and an interlocutory injunction with
the same goal, but these were removed (ibid at para 19).

2.2.1 Significant Change in Legal Framework
HFN submitted that the ratification of CCFIPPA triggers the duty to consult "because it grants

Chinese investors new, substantive, and enforceable rights with respect to the investments
which they hold, or may obtain, in areas over which the HFN and other First Nations assert
Aboriginal or treaty rights."62 The "minimum standard of treatment" ("MST") and "expro
priation" provisions of the agreement were deemed the most likely new enforceable rights
to result in awards against Canada,63 and consequendy, the most likely to influence govern
ment behaviour. These two provisions were discussed in detail in the decision.64 Additionally,

CCFIPPA's provision providing for "exceptions" to certain of the investment protections was
also discussed.65

2.2.2 Scope of Self-Government

Article 2(2) of CCFIPPA states that the treaty will apply to any entity whenever it exercises a
regulatory, administrative, or other government authority delegated by the Contracting Party.91

As explained above, HFN is in the process of seeking recognition of its right to self-govern
ment. As such, it submitted that CCFIPPA will adversely impact the scope of self-government
it can achieve, as it will be subject to these protections guaranteed to Chinese investors.92

In support of its position that Article 2(2) could one day apply to its regulatory
powers, HFN pointed to a number of agreements, such as the Yekooche First Nation Agreement,
the K'omoks Agreement in Principle, and the Westbank First Nation Self-Government Agreement,

which specifically require First Nations' laws to be consistent with Canada's international legal
obligations. In the event of an adverse ruling by an international arbitral tribunal, these agree
ments specify that First Nations must remedy their offending laws or measures.93 Crampton

CJ determined that there was no causal link between CCFIPPA and these international law
requirements in First Nations' agreements because Canada would likely require such a provi
sion in any future treaty in any event.94 In coming to this conclusion, he did not address the

additional legal obligations flowing from CCFIPPA down to the First Nation, but instead
focused on the inclusion of the provision itself in an eventual agreement.
The court dismissed HFN's self-governance concerns by highlighting that, at present,
its regulatory capacities are limited to those provided for in the Indian Act, which involve the
ability to adopt bylaws applicable on reserve only.95 HFN's assertion that its regulatory capacity

goes beyond the Indian Act as a result of its Land Use Plan was also dismissed, as this Plan was

3. COMMENTARY

Crampton CJ began his judgment by repeating the Supreme Courts foundati

ples regarding the Crowns duty to behave honourably and the need for reconcilia

Aboriginal peoples.97 Despite these pronouncements, he then proceeded to focus n

the three-part test, in the process paying insufficient heed to these principles. This

to the denial of HFN s request for a declaration that the Crown owed a duty to c

also an award of costs against HFN. Given that this is a case involved novel issues
importance in which the applicant had no pecuniary interest in the outcome, that

clearly has superior capacity to bear the costs, and that the application was not v

frivolous, the awarding of costs against the First Nation was very punishing.98 Ad

nizations, such as Leadnow.ca, have mobilized to help cope with the costs award, a

help fund an appeal, by fundraising on behalf of HFN. As of late November, Lead

raised $214,966."

In the following section, I will comment on four particularly troubling issues

courts decision. Firsdy, I will review the courts determination that these alleged adv

were speculative and that there is no causal link between CCFIPPA and these impact

erence to: a) high-level management decisions; b) the most contentious CCFIPPA p
and c) the alleged chilling effect. Secondly, I will discuss the modern First Nations'

an issue that was only briefly discussed by the court. Thirdly, I will discuss CCFIPP

inadequate environmental assessment process. Finally, I will review the challengin

stances of this case that unfortunately may have dissuaded the court from rulin
favour.

3.1 Speculative and No Causal Link
3.1.1 High-Level Management Decision

In trying to persuade the court that these provisions could impact its rights, HFN raised pos
sible scenarios that could lead to arbitral awards, such as the cancellation of a natural resource
extraction permit or the implementation of a moratorium on development over traditional
territories.100 The courts response to each proposed adverse impact was that they were specula

HFN argued that CCFIPPA could have a chilling effect on the government's willingness to
settle its claims regarding HFN's traditional territories and recognition of its right to self-gov
