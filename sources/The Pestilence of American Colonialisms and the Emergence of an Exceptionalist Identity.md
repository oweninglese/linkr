The Canada Thistle: The Pestilence of
American Colonialisms and the Emergence of
an Exceptionalist Identity, 1783–1839
TAYLOR SPENCE

This research demonstrates how a European plant, Cirsium arvense, common
to North America since the sixteenth century and commonly considered a
weed, became “Canadian” when Early National Americans labeled it the
Canada thistle in the years leading up to the War of 1812. This naming comprised part of a host of actions citizens of the new United States took to differentiate themselves from their imperial progenitor, and thus, the Canada
thistle might be considered an early origin-point of an American exceptionalist identity.

Canada into the fields of the early american republic: an insidious and treacherous foe to all cultivators of the soil. almost invisible, it floated like a whisper
and landed on the earth to lay in wait to erupt in a prickly, thorny mess. once
it was established farmers found it almost impossible to root out; they had to
battle it plant by painful plant. it became stuck in the gullets of cows, jammed
up farm tools, ruined hay, made noses run, and perhaps worst of all, it looked
wild, chaotic, and disorderly—everything the ideal american farm should not
be. it was the Canada thistle.

m. J. le ray de Chaumont, “the father and founder” of the Jefferson
County agricultural association, of Jefferson County, new york, in his opening remarks to the 1830 annual Cattle Show in Watertown, “supposed we are
indebted to our northern neighbours” for the thistle and bewailed that “some
parts of the ground are now so impregnated with the seed . . . that if the smallest opening is made in the woods, it will take possession.” one new york
farmer feared “the whole country will be overrun by these intruders,” meaning
the Canada thistle. The Auburn Journal and Advertiser bemoaned the presence
of the thistle “in almost every lot and field” of Cayuga County in western new
york. “The farmer who undertakes this business” of thistle eradication, one
newspaper warned, must “nerve himself for the contest. no half-way measures
will answer.” de Chaumont admitted that the pest had so “often been attacked
in this place and to all appearances with so little success, that it requires some
degree of fortitude to renew the battle.”1
early nineteenth-century newspapers in the border region of the british
empire and its former colonies called for the collective wisdom of their readers in this war against the Canada thistle. The Pittsfield Sun offered a twentydollar prize to any farmer who could find the means of “extirpating” the weed.
The Berkshire Star, observing that the thistle was “extending itself among us
to an alarming degree,” called for the same—“at once.” one farmer swore
that cutting the stalks “at the change of the moon” was the secret. another believed that pouring brine on the stalks stunted their growth. Papers reported
that farmers found this remedy effective, but then later realized that the salty
water simply attracted cows, whose hooves pulverized the thistle into oblivion.
This led to the suggestion that farmers should just send “two industrious
Plough boys” into infested fields and have them beat the weed into submission
with wooden cudgels. The state of new york passed a law requiring town officers to eradicate the thistle and mandated that one farmer in every community—called the “overseer”—control it and all other noxious weeds along
roads. in its urgency to find a solution to its thistle problem, the new york
house of assembly welcomed the address of m. Crouze, who claimed to have
a remedy for the “bite of mad wolves, and a means of eradicating and destroying the Canada thistle.”2
There were two things that de Chaumont and his farmers did not know
about the so-called Canada thistle. First, Cirsium arvense did not originate in
british Canada, but came from europe, probably carried in the guts of livestock and probably as early as the sixteenth century. but it is hard to know

has noted, “conquistadores” and other early colonizers “paid little attention
to farming [and] less to weeds” and so remarked but rarely on their presence.
but european migrants to british north america writing in the early nineteenth century were concerned with settlement and farming. They recognized
and remarked on their well-known enemy, a plant they knew as the “Common
thistle,” but they thought it must be native to Canada, so ubiquitous were its
purple flowers and spiky leaves.3
Second, not only was C. arvense a migrant from europe and not native to
Canada, but nineteenth-century euro-american farmers trying to eradicate it
were in actuality responsible for spreading it. Crosby highlighted how plants
deemed “weeds” evolved “in conflict and cooperation” with human beings to
become efficient colonizers in areas of “ecological disasters”: places where
the land has been disturbed. “Weeds are the red Cross of the plant world,”
writes Crosby; they stabilize disturbed areas. They have difficulty taking hold
in established prairies, pastures, or forests. Perhaps no other place in all the
Western hemisphere in the first decades of the nineteenth century experienced
more ecological “disaster” than the state of new york undergoing the market
and communications revolutions. deforestation in service to canal-digging,

road-building, track-laying, and telegraph-stringing, as well as to plowing,
hoeing, and harvesting, caused C. arvense to flourish. de Chaumont reminded
his association that road building “form[ed] an important part of the yearly
labor of every farmer.” but every time a farmer cut down a tree, graded a new
roadbed, or plowed a new field—in short made an improvement, which was,
after all, the raison d’être of the Jefferson County agricultural Society—he
invited C. arvense to come and stay.4
Crosby and other “biogeographers” have noted the integral role that biota
like weeds played in the successes of worldwide european colonization beginning in the sixteenth century. Part of this expansion entailed the spreading
of european “agri-culture”: particular ways and traditions of thinking about
the landscape, as well as the extraction, production, and use of natural resources. european agri-culture included judgments about which plants were
“good” and “bad” and which ones were “crops” and “weeds.” matthew Chew
has noted that along with colonization the field of botany transformed, “ballooning” the naming of new species and bringing forth new labels such as “native,” “exotic,” and “invasive.” Plants in imperial and colonial systems were
not just plants; they were both biological and cultural phenomena.5
but what role did plants play in nation-state formation? What function did
biotic phenomena like the Canada thistle serve in the nations that emerged
from the north american empire? C. arvense had been in north america for

hundreds of years, but it only became Canadian when the farmers of the early
republic began to complain of its presence and fear its spread as a potential
hindrance to their actions of landscape transformation and resource extraction.
early national americans were in actuality experiencing the increased growth
of C. arvense in their fields. but they were also understanding the thistle in a
new, national way. This transnational transformation of C. arvense into the
“Canada thistle” signifies the on-the-ground process of the construction of an
american exceptionalist identity in the post–revolutionary era.
Three aspects of the biotic and cultural phenomenon of the “Canada thistle”
taken together helped construct a sense of exceptionalist identity for the early
united States. The way C. arvense spread and propagated echoed american
fears about the continued presence of monarchically based colonies on the
continent. The abundant presence of thistles in Canadian fields supported
american beliefs in the laxity of british colonial farmers and the inferiority
of their agricultural practices. and the dramatic landscape transformations
taking place, particularly in new york, as part of agro-industrialization contrasted starkly with the lack of similar developments in the Canadas, further
supporting american belief that the thistle was a symptom of Canadian,
british, and thus monarchical backwardness.
however, all of these actual manifestations of C. arvense would have meant
little without the “revolutionary border,” the line drawn between the british
empire and its former colonies. The border imbued everyday occurrences like
the thistle with ideological meaning and created a culture of comparison in
the borderland. The ngram of “Canada thistle” (see Tables 1 and 1a) demonstrates that the nationalized term for the weed began to be used between 1807
and 1810. “Canada thistle” exhibited an obvious spike during what alan Taylor has called the “Civil War of 1812,” demonstrating that its cultural phenomenology was a product of the ongoing conflicts as well as political
discourse between subjects of the british empire and citizens of its former
colonies. by contrast, other unigrams like “progress” and “improvement”
showed continuity across time. Furthermore, the three years during which C.
arvense became Canadian overlapped with the earliest newspaper reference
of the weed in 1808.6
The construction of this exceptionalist identity made up part of the evolving
power struggles taking place between the nations and peoples impacted by
the laying down of the international border. For uS citizens, labeling the weed
“Canadian” was one of a many actions they took to explain and justify their

revolt and separation from the mother country, to demonstrate their uniqueness
in relation to their imperial parent, and to articulate why and how their country
was to be the carrier of societal progress on the continent. but most importantly, this emerging exceptionalism enabled early national americans to discount the sovereignty of the other americans in the borderland: indigenous
peoples. The border that created two nations simultaneously also bisected three
indigenous confederacies. The border divided the people of the haudenosaunee (the iroquois Confederacy) between upper and lower Canada
and the state of new york. Those who remained in the united States experienced intense removal pressure after the revolution, culminating in the effort
to force them completely out of the state under the provisions of andrew Jackson’s 1830 indian removal act. This effort ultimately failed, but the different
agri-culture of the haudenosaunee and their different relationship with weeds
like C. arvense, along with early national americans’ emerging exceptionalist
identity, provided a persuasive rationale for their removal. Thus, as a biotic
and cultural event, the Canada thistle can function as an “index species” of
north american colonialisms: marking both the development of a key component of its culture—exceptionalism—as well as signaling the actual progression of the colonial nation-state.7
C. arvense possesses admirable qualifications as a colonizer. it can spread
by floating through the air on thistledown. People and animals can transport
its seeds in hay bales, in the folds of their clothing, in their hides, and in their
guts. C. arvense’s latin binomial translates as “creeping thistle,” and indeed
its roots are its glory. root systems travel rapidly underground, sprouting male
and female plants that mate, dropping more seed, and thereby creating more
roots. even when broken up, root pieces survive to send out creepers that produce more stalks. The seeds can stay dormant in the ground for up to twenty
years. no wonder farmers called it “the cursed thistle.”8
like C. arvense european colonizers came to north america in the sixteenth century and began to put down roots, creeping into indigenous territories, and practicing a varying mixture of extractive and settler colonialisms.
extractive colonialism aimed at securing resources with minimal numbers of
colonials in order to collect and transport them back to the metropole. Settler
colonialism transplanted people to a colony for permanent residency also with
the aim of extracting resources, but with the additional goal of using colonies
to receive excess population. The French conducted primarily extractive colonialism, creating what Jay gitlin has called the “Creole Corridor,” an arc518

shaped strip-of-an-empire that Francis Parkman described as stretching from
the “snows of Canada [to] the canebrakes of louisiana.” They extracted fur,
fish, timber and its byproducts—turpentine and potash. The dutch did the
same, at least until the british took over their american holdings in the late
seventeenth century. For the british, emigration and settlement were at least
as important as extraction. richard hakluyt’s A Discourse Concerning Western Planting argued america could produce foodstuffs for great britain but
also become a haven for surplus population. by 1640 british america counted
21,500 settlers as compared to new France, which only had 270. if one had
to guess who was to blame for introducing C. arvense to america, it would
have to be the French; their low numbers made it difficult to quickly put lands
they deforested under the plow, thereby giving the thistle a foothold.9
This population imbalance continued to increase through the fall of new
France in 1759 and great britain’s claim of sole dominion of northeastern
north america in 1763. ironically the best evidence of great britain’s “success” in planting its colonists in american soil was that it lost the bulk of its
american “crop” in what Jack P. greene has called “the settler revolt” of the
american revolution. of the 1,862,561 colonials in british america at the
time of the revolution, a full 73 percent became citizens of the new political
entity called the united States. These newly named citizens continued to conduct both extractive and settler colonialism, only distinguishing between the
two types of colonialism became more difficult. For now rather than extracting
and transporting their resources to a far-off metropole, they practiced colonialism in relationship to their nearby metropoles of Philadelphia, new york,
and boston. This homegrown colonialism allowed the nation to retain locally
more of the profits from their resource extractions. The remaining british subjects north of the border stayed dependent on british mercantile networks,
which tended to promote the production of monocultures such as wheat, as
well as wholesale deforestation. both actions encouraged thistle production.
This primarily export economy also sowed the seeds of dissension between
british-colonial insiders plugged into these colonial networks and outsiders
who desired to develop local economies. This latter group began to complain
of neglect from its far-off imperial parent, especially as agro-industrialization
ramped up south of the border after the War of 1812.10
one important factor in both the creation of the Canada thistle and an
american exceptionalist identity was the shared agri-culture of the euroamerican settlers along the border. Just as there would have been no Canada

thistle without the revolutionary border, there could have been no Canada
thistle without a relatively homogeneous population sharing a similar agriculture. This was because in order for that polity to arrive at a consensus about
the origin and meaning of C. arvense, and to name it “Canadian,” they had to
agree on a host of things: that weeds were bad and that the thistle was a weed,
what the ideal farm should look like, what agricultural improvement was, what
societal system was most likely to bring about progress, and what role government should play in promoting those processes. For C. arvense to become
the Canada thistle, a critical mass of people had to agree on what its antithesis
should be. in arriving at this consensus, americans defined who they were in
contrast to their northern neighbors.
making generalizations is always risky, but it is possible to make generalizations about this population because of its documentable homogeneity.
nearly all migrants to the uS side of the border between 1800 and 1850 came
from great britain and especially from ireland (see Tables 2 and 3). in the
years after 1815, great britain was losing an increasing number of people,
reaching a sustained high of twenty thousand persons per annum after 1825.
in 1820, the first year the united States government kept immigration records,
the total number of non-slave migrants into the united States numbered 8,385,
with 7,691 arriving from europe. of those, 6,024 hailed from the british isles
with more than half from ireland. The peak year of the decade, 1828, saw
27,382 total migrants, 45 percent of whom came from ireland. The number
continually rose so that by 1837 total immigration to the new nation reached
79,340 people, almost 90 percent of european origin, with 28,508 (36 percent)
coming from ireland and 12,218 (15 percent) from england. by 1842 70 percent of immigrants into the borderland hailed from great britain and 50 percent of those came from ireland.11

These anglo-americans shared a common agri-culture, which was essentially english pastoralism but with an american twist. The english progenitor
was the desire for an “untroubled rural delight in peace,” as raymond
Williams characterizes it: the belief in the right to a “clear and competent estate” and the vision of orderly acres, hedgerows, and neat buildings. The twist
was that these were settlers: they pulled up roots, moved themselves and their
families, and relocated thousands of miles away following a vision of a hopedfor landscape and the life that would come with it. Were settler colonials more
agri-culturally idealistic: fundamentalist in their pursuit of the perfect farm?
it is hard to know. but this settler colonial vision of what could, or should be,
found a powerful synergy in the idealism of the early national republic. agricultural booster de Chaumont awarded prizes for the best farms in Jefferson
County according to the dictates of this transnational agri-culture. The “1st
Premium” went to a two-hundred-acre farm with a nice balance of grain fields,
plenty of cattle, and bountiful orchards. it was “well-fenced,” boasting five
hundred rods of stone fencing that was three feet at its base and five feet high.
The fields were “very clean [and with] no weeds.” by contrast the “5th Premium” winner had only one hundred acres and, although it was clean, it only
had “rail fences”; it did not have the balance of fields, cattle, and orchards.
The “6th Premium” was different. it had none of the things the other farms
had, yet because it was in an area of very new settlement, the farmer received
the award for being “far ahead of his neighbors.” So in line with english pastoralism, Jefferson County farms that exhibited cleanliness, order, and a high
level of development garnered awards. but in an emergent american pastoralism, demonstrations of rapid progression from wilderness to “premium-winning” quality appear to have been an added requirement.12
de Chaumont strove to spread this progress-minded american pastoralism
to his association’s membership with a scheme he called the “pattern farm.”
he told each farmer to write with chalk on a “piece of board stating in a few
words the nature of the experiment” he had conducted in his fields. if he put
two bushels of lime per acre on one section of peas, and three on the next,
then he should write that on the board, post it in front of the field, and he “will
persuade more to follow [his] example than the recommendations of the greatest orators could do.” Passing by these fields, farmers could exchange knowledge and improve their yields at the same time as they would be spurred to
improvement by means of competition. it is not known whether de Chaumont
read Jeremy bentham in his off hours, but his “pattern farm” certainly came

The Canada Thistle

close to the Panopticon’s “ideal perfection” of having every farmer in Jefferson County “conceive himself to be . . . under the eyes” of someone “at every
instant.” american pastoral agri-culture included the belief that progression
toward an ideal society was a (white) farmer’s duty. “Withdraw . . . agriculture,” another agricultural booster, elkanah Watson, averred, and “men in all
countries [will] degenerate into wandering arabs.”13
other socially minded thinkers shared Watson’s awareness of the societal
importance of agriculture as a benchmark of civilization, and their belief that
the united States was at the vanguard of the progression of civilization fed
right into a burgeoning american exceptionalist identity. english utopian socialist robert owen claimed in 1829 that “important advantages” were to be
found in the “properly cultivated and well-laid out” country home where people could attain “convenience, beauty and pleasure and to have at the same
time a full share of the best society.” irish labor radical george henry evans
described his “picture of a happy society,” which had a town at its center
amidst a “mixture of hills, valleys, and streams . . . [with the] land well fenced
and cultivated . . . [and the] inhabitants mostly husbandmen.” both men were
migrants to the united States and envisioned their ideal societies not in monarchical england or ireland, or even Canada, but on the democratic land of the
united States. They believed that the united States had the potential to spread
the “rural delight,” a “competency,” and pastoral beauty “in every six miles
square of this vast republic” not just for the wealthy, but for all people.14
it made sense that the thistle became the symbol of the antithesis to this
american pastoral democratic agri-culture, not only because most farmers
considered it a bothersome weed, but because it had a long association with
the british monarchy, and specifically its imperialism. James iii of Scotland,
who ruled from 1488 to 1513, officially adopted the thistle as the “royal plant
badge,” possibly, as one early history claims, in response to anti-Popish sentiments expressed by the Scots who had publicly destroyed images of the
Catholic St. giles. in 1687, after english conquest, James ii of the new united
Kingdom of england and Scotland established the order of the Thistle to reward Scottish peers who aided him in his colonization.15
Were these the same cultivars as C. arvense? it is not clear. but does it really matter? Polities are neither ever of one mind about communal symbols
nor overly fussy. For example, british colonizers in north america blamed
the French for the presence of C. arvense in their fields, saying that the
voyageurs spread the thistle on their annual inland migrations in search of

furs. but during the american revolution, and with Canada rapidly becoming
a bastion of the british monarchy, rebellious american colonials, who had
only recently been british subjects themselves, blamed general burgoyne for
bringing the thistle with him when he invaded from the north in 1777. Today
new Zealanders call C. arvense the California thistle, testifying to the cultural
flexibility of biotic phenomena.16
in the early national republic not everyone saw the thistle as a bad thing.
“a Farmer” wrote to a bangor, maine, paper defending the thistle, claiming
that it was a “well known fact that Canadian horses are the most hardy horses
in america,” and, he continued, “it is also well known that the Canadian Thistle constitutes the chief part of their food in winter.” he further averred that
cows who regularly ate thistles produced more abundant milk. euro-american
homeopaths had also long valued C. arvense for its medicinal qualities, employing it as a remedy for high blood pressure and varicose veins. but for a
majority of early national americans, and on the eve of another war with the
british, the Canada thistle ceased its metaphorical peregrinations and solidified as a symbol of all that was wrong about those people north of the border.
it was a troublesome weed and therefore antithetical to emergent american
pastoralism. it was abundantly present in british Canada, a nation identified
with monarchy. and it was terrifyingly tenacious, symbolizing the persistence
and intransigence of the british empire on the continent.17
in 1808 the Hampshire Federalist claimed to be witnessing the advance of
the Canada thistle into Connecticut. “it is seen in quantities in the fields near
montréal and nearly blocks up the roads of Canada,” the paper claimed. “it is
yearly traveling southward and has entered massachusetts—we have seen a
few patches of it on the newburyport Turnpike, in we believe newbury.” one
investigator claimed to have seen it “to a very great degree” in Quebec in 1812
and believed it was as “contagious to lands in the neighborhood of it as the
yellow fever among men.” in 1818 fields near lake Champlain purportedly
had become so choked by the Canada thistle that farmers had moved to other
parts “where the evils of this enemy are unknown.” Clover seed from Vermont,
a state bordering on lower Canada, was thought by some to have been the
vector of the contagion. advertisements claimed to offer clover seed free of
the hated plant. new yorkers in 1810 read with dismay these reports of C. arvense’s advance south and west. by 1841 the Schenectady Reflector blamed
the “thousands of acres . . . allowed to go to seed” in Canada for spreading
“the mischief as far as the winds can blow” and reported that the Canada thistle

The Canada Thistle

was “rapidly spreading over many farms in the country.” english settler
William brown reported in 1849 that the thistle was “fearfully encroaching”
into the fields of western new york, “infesting” the land for hundreds of miles.
“The evil is of such a magnitude,” he wrote, “that it is impossible for the farmers to contend with it, and in consequence they give up the struggle in despair,
and by this means . . . increase the calamity.” brown, perhaps out of loyalty
to his monarch, could not understand why the thistle was called “Canadian,”
for during his residence in the Canadas he “scarcely ever saw it in large quantities,” whereas it was “rapidly extending itself” in new york, and it was
feared that “before long the whole of the eastern States will be desolated by
it.”18
The truth was that there were probably abundant thistles on both sides of
the border by the early nineteenth century. C. arvense did not distinguish between american and Canadian. Thistles were spreading throughout the borderland, but for very different reasons, depending on the side of the border. in
lower and upper Canada the over-cultivation of the land for the imperial
wheat market, paired with wide-scale deforestation to plant more wheat and
to harvest timber, produced bumper crops of thistles. While south-of-the-border agro-industrialization, defined here as the transition from “first nature”
extractions in the forms of timber and potash to “second nature” productions
of wheat, dairy, and industry, along with all the attendant infrastructural building, were causing a classic Crosbian “ecological disaster,” to the remediation
of which the thistle came with alacrity.19
but, in reality, perceptions were what mattered. This was the era of agricultural improvement, when scientific agriculture first began to gain widespread traction, and new york state was at the vanguard of this movement.
boosters like de Chaumont, Watson, and others, who were themselves signs
of this change, were sensitive to the significance of weeds, and the many new
agricultural fairs, competitions, and journals enabled them to highlight these
threats to progress as never before. moreover, and for many reasons, the
united States was indeed transforming and developing at a remarkable rate,
much faster than british Canada. a noticeable and remarked-upon development gap began to yawn between the societies north and south of the border,
a gap that appeared to reinforce the meaning americans attached to the Canada
thistle, as well as confirm their growing sense of exceptionalism. it was a classic self-fulfilling prophecy. americans appeared to be progressing while Canadians appeared to be stagnating. Since americans were progressing, they could

not be responsible for the thistle; it must be Canada’s fault. and the more
“progress” americans enacted, the more abundant their thistle crop, the more
they were confirmed in their belief in the superiority of their system.
after the revolution, new york had negotiated a series of treaties that converted more than half of the haudenosaunee homeland into real estate. Settlers
cut down trees with abandon, burned the stumps in order to produce valuable
potash, and harvested bumper crops of wheat on the carbon-rich lands. The
napoleonic Wars fueled demand for timber and wheat. in one year, 1807, the
Port of new york shipped out 26,357,963 tons of exports (wheat and timber,
mostly) and would have continued to do so if not for President Jefferson’s
miscalculated embargo act that dropped exports to 5,606,058 tons in 1808,
reaching a low of 209,670 tons in 1814 during the war. after the War of 1812,
profits spiked again only to plummet in 1818 when a major economic crisis
struck the atlantic world, then crept up and leveled off to 13,740,205 tons by
1834, a level reached first in 1797. de Chaumont chastised the members of
the Jefferson County agricultural association for participating in “wild
schemes of fortune” that had fueled but were also fueled by this boom. “The
general contagion” had proven “too great a temptation to speculations,” he
said. Farmers had built too many “costly buildings, and [indulged in] other
profuse habits,” de Chaumont averred. now with the “hard times” after 1818
his fellow agriculturalists were harvesting only “painful and discouraging reflections.”20
however, boosters like de Chaumont as well as new york’s government,
of one mind in devising ways to increase resource extractions, deserved at
least some of the blame for farmers’ zealous engagement with the marketplace.
before 1820 the investigation of new agricultural techniques and their adoption rested primarily with elites: men such as the hudson river oligarchs
robert livingston and Stephen Van rensselaer iii. This earlier generation had
earned great profits from wheat cultivation. but intensive cultivation had depleted their soils, and so they had turned to scientific agriculture to improve
their yields. livingston—manor lord, politician, head of the new york State
bar, and author of a treatise on breaking wild elk to the yoke in order to use
them as draft animals—reserved part of Clermont, his estate on the hudson,
as an experimental farm. he and some friends founded the new york Society
for the Promotion of agriculture, art and manufactures in 1791.21
in 1810 Watson, deemed that “infernal paving yankee” by his albany
neighbors because of his frequent calls for the town’s fathers to upgrade the

streets, attended the annual shearing fete at Clermont. There he heard a lecture
by a noted Columbia university agriculture scholar and developed the idea
for a statewide series of fairs to promote scientific farming. as head of the
newly founded new york agricultural Society, and in line with his imperial
ambitions for the state, Watson sent letters to all uS consuls in various foreign
ports entreating them to send samples of “seeds . . . legumes, roots . . . and
stones of fruit” as well as “a pair of sheep [from] China, india, angora, and
Peru” so that a comprehensive collection for experimentation could be created.
Farmers all over the northeast replicated Watson’s agricultural fair, which became known as the “berkshire model.”22
The farmers of new york possessed a powerful ally in politician dewitt
Clinton who communed with a vision of the state leading the charge of uS
expansion across the continent. as mayor, governor, and state senator, Clinton
built on the efforts of earlier agricultural boosters to make albany the center
for agricultural education in the east with, according to historian margaret W.
rossiter, “the home of the most active journal, the strongest lobby, the best
organized society, and the seat of the most generous legislature.” Clinton established a board of agriculture and granted ten thousand dollars for the formation of county agricultural societies. more than fifty were created. he also
called for a series of fairs on the berkshire model. Starting in the 1830s the
Albany Cultivator, bearing the masthead “To improve the Soil and the mind,”
began disseminating agri-cultural knowledge throughout the region. by 1843
mr. ellsworth, the noted agriculturalist, believed “the whole country was more
or less interested in [the] improvement of agriculture” citing the taking of geological surveys, the increasing number of periodicals and treatises, the spread
of agricultural societies, and “the increased habits of temperance and sobriety
of the labourer” as evidence of the general improvement of agriculture.23
Fundamental to the attainment of new york’s imperial status was the advent of agro-industrialization, which Clinton might be credited with starting
with the erie Canal, completed in 1825. The canal enabled settlers to suck out
the first nature resources from the state and spurred the development of second
nature resources all along its length. agro-industrialization became the enactment of new yorkers’ seeming progression from men subjugated by nature
to men able to subdue nature. it was a “wonder-working and inventive age”
according to Steele’s Guide, where “space and gravity . . . though not to be
wholly conquered by the ingenuity of man, are to be made subject to his
power.” ironically while every spade of soil turned along the canal’s nearly

four-hundred-mile length enacted a narrative of progress for new yorkers, its
construction also more deeply planted the thistle-weed in the soil of the state.24
The canal fueled expansion, opening up new first nature regions in the west,
which began to compete with the older wheat-growing districts in the east.
“on the opening of the erie canal,” nineteenth-century economist Thomas
Prentice Kettell wrote, “a new state of things presented itself. Western new
york threw off its frontier aspect, and put on an air of civilization, since it became a receiver of western produce and exporter of goods.” in fact between
1820 and 1835 the six western counties of new york experienced the greatest
population increase in the state resulting in a density of more than twenty persons per square mile. michigan, indiana, and ohio were forming what became
known as the “wheat belt,” a region that supplied grain to the rest of the country and the british empire. Clinton and other boosters wanted to wrest the
flow of commodities coming out of this rapidly developing wheat-growing
region and turn it from both the Ports of new orleans and montreal to the
Port of new york, an ambition fully realized with the canal. it took almost
ten years for the british to build a canal system that took advantage of the natural water thoroughfare of lakes erie and ontario and the St. lawrence river,
by which time new york had begun to overlay railroads on its already extensive canal network. in terms of the carrying trade, british Canada never really
recovered from the blow of the erie Canal.25
While the canal brought first nature extractions from the great lakes to
the atlantic, it also supplied the towns springing up all along its length at a
rate that was consistently higher than the carrying trade, thereby spurring industrialization. in 1831, the year new york passed its first anti-thistle statute,
englishwoman Frances Trollope traveled through the state, one of many europeans who came to see the twin wonders of niagara Falls and the changes
wrought by the state’s farmers and entrepreneurs. Trollope wrote, “one of the
most famous of the cities built on the Jack and bean-stalk principle” has
“many splendid edifices in wood and certainly more houses, warehouses, factories, and steam-engines than ever were collected together in the same space
of time . . . i was told by a fellow traveler that the stumps of the forest are still
to be found firmly rooted in the cellars.” Trollope also remarked on a similar
phenomenon in “lockport . . . the strangest looking place i have ever beheld.
as fast as half a dozen trees were cut down, a factory was raised up; stumps
still contest the ground with pillars, and porticoes are seen to struggle with
rocks.” The growth observed by Trollope in western new york ricocheted

back to new york City causing real estate values to jump from $69,530,753
in 1820 to $213,723,703 in 1835. The Niles Weekly Register of 1829 estimated
that the canal increased the overall value of the state’s land by more than one
hundred million dollars. agro-industrialization meant, according to new york
Senator martin Van buren in 1827, that “no spot on god’s green earth [was]
more prosperous and happy” than the empire State.26
new york—both as a destination and a conduit—began to draw people
both from the united States and abroad fueling landscape transformation, the
economy, and presumably the growth of the thistle. The uS population doubled every twenty-five years after the revolution, and increasingly these people moved into and through new york. in 1800, as Table 3 shows, a white
migrant would have been equally likely to enter the united States at either
norfolk, Philadelphia, or new york, the ports of the three most populous states
in the union. The presumption here is that most migrants entered the state in
which they eventually resided. The fact that fifty years later new york possessed a full 30 percent of all white people counted in the united States supports this presumption. Virginia possessed only 9 percent. Fifty years had
witnessed a dramatic shift to the north of white immigration. new york experienced explosive population growth over these decades increasing in numbers
from between 60 percent and 80 percent annually as Table 4 demonstrates.
The most populous state in the union over the first five decades of the nineteenth century, it also helped increase the populations of the other states in the
border region, a region that grew from containing 50 percent of all whites in
the united States to having 76 percent by 1850 with a high in 1840 of 80 percent. grenville mellen in his 1839 “guide” to america, published in new york
City, averred that “there is no instance, in any age or country, where a whole
nation has emerged, in so short a period . . . into such a rapid change . . . it has
been like the work of magic.”27
Canadians watched this growth with fear and envy, while they watched the
thistle grow all around them. after the revolution, the Crown granted land in
Canada to any loyalist willing to relocate from its rebel former colonies, and
thousands did, first to the more developed lower province, and later in increasing numbers to upper Canada. but this climate of loyalism hampered social
discourse and allowed a small cadre of “first families” to rule in the colonies,
unwilling to change a system that had garnered them extraordinary profits,
and using the charge of “disloyalty” as a bludgeon to stifle reform. in 1817

york and was amazed that an area settled ten years after upper Canada could
have been so much more developed and vibrant than its northern neighbor.
he decided to conduct a survey of landowners all over his province in order
to ascertain what factors they felt kept them from progressing as their american neighbors had. upper Canadian farmers complained of two things consistently: a lack of bank capital and the presence of thousands of undeveloped
acres held by land speculators. nearly half of all the respondents to gourlay’s
survey said that these unprocurable lands retarded the growth of the province
by keeping property values low, impeding the building of roads, rails, and
canals, and restricting the increase of provincial revenue to fund schools and
post offices. Several of the farmers demanded that the Crown sell these lands

on the open market. in response, the colonial government arrested gourlay,
charged him with sedition, imprisoned him, and finally exiled him south of
the border. along with this repression came corruption. by 1836 a select few
had gobbled up more than a quarter of the almost seventeen million acres of
land granted in upper Canada.28
in spite of the damping effects of this corruption, the period 1826 to 1851
saw upper Canada’s population jump 470 percent to 952,000 mainly due to
the free or very inexpensive land offered by the Crown. Wheat production
soared as well. in 1825 upper Canada produced 33,979 barrels of wheat for
export and by 1848 that number had jumped to 522,244 barrels. but this increase merely reflected the increase in population; per capita agricultural output remained essentially flat. The upper Canada assembly allocated funds to
establish agricultural extension in 1830, but it took sixteen years to launch a
network of local organizations and a publication. Their organizer, W. g. edmundson, said his inspiration had been the state of new york. but in 1842,
when robert barclay visited upper Canada, the province showed all the signs
of developing into a prime thistle habitat with “bare and blackened poles” of
trees “burnt preparatory to being cut down.” There were no railways, no local
markets and the “roads . . . are of such a description as to be nearly impassable.” James F. W. Johnston, a university professor from england who visited
upper Canada, witnessed this extractive monoculture and warned farmers to
rotate their crops and stop raising only wheat for export lest their fields be
overrun with weeds like the thistle. in 1846 J. W. gamble, charged with the
task of giving the inaugural toast at the first meeting of the upper Canada
agricultural association in Toronto, summed up the progress of the province’s
farmers with something less than a congratulatory flourish: “This year, after
a lapse of 20 years, [i] visited the united States. [i] was astonished, and asked
[myself] whether there was the same progress here, and could but answer
‘no.’”29
in lower Canada things were the same but different. Quebec possessed
two types of land tenure geared toward two different types of agricultural extraction. The French had granted large tracts of prime land along the St.
lawrence to soldiers and other colonials in a quasi-feudal scheme called
seigneurialism. Seigneurs leased lands to tenants called habitants who produced mostly wheat that was pooled and shipped to the colonial metropole.
The Crown guaranteed Canadian wheat producers a steady price with a preferential tariff, a benefit mostly enjoyed by the seigneurs, habitants, and their

Francophone allies. but this system did not encourage agricultural diversification or improvement. J. e. burton, a resident of lower Canada, confronted
a habitant and demanded to know why he let weeds like the thistle infest his
land: “mon dieu, il me coute trop a les toucher avec mes doigts” (“my god
it’s too taxing to pull them out by hand”). Clearly this habitant’s agri-culture
did not mandate removing thistles from his fields.30
The prevalence of thistles indicated that the monoculture was fast becoming
unsustainable. american benjamin Silliman was appalled on an 1819 trip to
Quebec when he saw habitants dump their stable manure in big piles on the
ice of the St. lawrence to be swept away at first thaw because, as they explained, they were “afraid of raising too much produce, lest the price [of it]
should fall.” That they should waste “so rich a treasure” Silliman found “much
to be regretted.” in 1821 the Quebec Gazette concurred attributing the high
price of grain “to the imperfect state of our agriculture.” habitant farmers
were producing a poor agricultural product “frequently composed of one half
weeds,” according to one commentator, something well known in english
commodities markets. lower Canadian grain exports dropped 61 percent in
the period from 1818 to 1822. overall, wheat production had declined 50 percent from the eighteenth century. in 1825 the province produced a surplus of
wheat for export of just under 150,000 barrels, but by 1828 it had to import
almost 50,000 barrels just to survive. The decline in crop yields moved the
assembly to open up an official inquiry, and it found that single-crop production paired with old-fashioned techniques had leeched the soil of its nutrients.
investigators Peter burnett and m. meiklejohn had discovered that the French
clergy, the seigneurs, and the habitants themselves disparaged the introduction
of “green crops”—those legumes that would replenish the soil as well as provide locally marketable vegetables—because of “immediate private interest.”
rather than rotating fields, which would have allowed the land to rest as well
as to impede new thistles from taking root, habitants were plowing and planting every inch of ground in wheat. depleted soils encouraged C. arvense to
come and rejuvenate them. and weakened plants were also more susceptible
to the hessian fly and the wheat midge, two pests that plagued northern wheat
fields. because of these factors, by 1837 lower Canada was on the verge of
famine. Le Canadien reported that the farmers of Trois-Pistoles were “eating
their horses” and that there had been “no crops for four year and many people
haven't even a potato.” in spite of these disturbing signs the Crown did not
discontinue its protective tariff until 1846 and did not invest in infrastructure

improvements that would have developed a more diversified home market.31
as the ultimate sign of the development gap along the border, british
Canada began to import american wheat from the “wheat belt” to feed its own
colonial subjects. during the period from 1823 to 1827 the great lakes states
exported an average of 55,995 tons of flour a year to Canada, an amount that
jumped to 135,014 tons in the period from 1836 to 1840. in 1827 ships carried
53,129 barrels of flour from the united States to great britain, 107,420 barrels
to the Canadas, 271,524 to South america, and 302,674 to the West indies.
by 1842 these numbers had swollen to 208,021 barrels to great britain,
288,725 to South america, 369,048 to the Canadas, and 393,712 to the West
indies. by 1849 lower Canada had to import almost three hundred thousand
barrels of wheat to feed itself.32
For early national americans this development gap turned the borderland
into a kind of “pattern farm” of its own, where they could compare and assess
the relative merits of the two political systems—democracy and monarchy—
side by side. in 1829 the Third earl of bathurst, great britain’s secretary of
state for war and the colonies, had to admit to being “dazzled by america’s
eye-catching prosperity” as compared to his own colonies. The montrealbased newspaper the Vindicator alleged in 1829 “that while the several
provinces of the great north american colonial family are increasing in their
wealth and advancing in their prosperity lower Canada” appeared to be in “a
retrograde movement.” Some like Silliman blamed some innate quality in the
French habitants for this lassitude, concluding that with increased “british and
anglo-american” in-migration “more vigor and activity” would be imparted
to the “community.” others like La Minerve in 1836 lamented that Canadians
were leaving the province in search of “more liberal institutions” in “michigan
and other parts of the united States” blaming “the existing colonial system”
for the exodus. one immigrant guide published in new york in 1836 declared
that upper Canada afforded “strong inducements to emigrants” not least was
its “one millions of acres of uncultivated land, besides many millions of acres
now surveyed and for sale at moderate prices” but concluded that the “embarrassments of all colonial governments” have “kept [the Province] back in
population and improvements” as compared with new york. by the 1830s,
when Scottish farmer Patrick Shirreff traveled around the borderland, the uS
definition of progress had become so hegemonic that he labeled it “natural”
as opposed to the “artificial” system of monarchical colonialism north of the
border, a system he believed must “consequently experience change.”33

but some Canadians resisted change. When economic crisis struck the atlantic World in early 1837, the bank of upper Canada preferred to pay out all
its deposits and close its doors rather than protect its investors and suspend
specie payments as american banks had done. upper Canadian lieutenantgovernor Francis bond head defended the bank’s actions saying that, “paying
out specie would cleanse the economy of speculation and tend most materially
to assist in crushing the enemy of civilization—democracy.” but many other
english and French-speaking colonials north of the border decided that democracy was exactly what was needed to stem the spread of thistles. later in 1837
and through 1839, upper and lower Canadians rose up in attempted revolution. hundreds of americans supported them by becoming filibusters and invading british Canada through 1842. The british empire brutally crushed
these revolts, and the united States did not seize this opportunity to expand
its territory offered by the freebooters. but the thistle had played its small and
eloquent part in convincing a significant population of borderlanders that the
british empire should be torn from the american ground.34
as C. arvense spread in the wake of progress its meanings and uses as a
cultural signifier evolved as well. in 1820 “a Son of liberty” labeled an albany politician “a political Canada thistle” for his propensity to “always delve
into the depths of mischief.” Freedom was like the Canada thistle to the New
York Daily Advertiser in 1821—“difficult to extirpate.” The Salem Gazette
likened the spread of slavery to the Canada thistle in 1823 calling it a “moral
pestilence.” The New Hampshire Patriot in 1825, trying to make sense of the
tumultuous political climate that would eventuate the Second Party System,
reported on “mr. drown’s” speech. This called for an amendment to the socalled “thistle bill” in which the fictional legislator lamented the passing of
the “Sweet Thistle,” which he stated had been seen much less “since the revolution” and its replacement by the invasive “Mongrel Thistle . . . a compound
of the Sweet Thistle, the Federal Thistle, the Canada Thistle, and the Scotch
Thistle.” The “mongrel thistle” could be discerned by the fact that it grew fast,
was flexible, mimicked other types of thistles especially in march. reflecting
the climate of anglophobia in parts of the united States following the Civil
War of 1812, drown’s solution to this new invasive weed was to strike the
word “Canada” from the bill so that the “whole race of Thistles” would be annihilated. but new uses for the thistle kept sprouting. The New York Commercial Advertiser in 1831 warned that the anti-masons were growing and
spreading with a force that was irresistible—“like the Canada thistle.” in the

The Canada Thistle

1833 parable of the “old Farmer,” the Nantucket Inquirer likened the temperance movement’s campaign to eradicate intoxicating liquor from the earth to
eliminating the Canada thistle “branch, root, nay every fibre.” The Farmer’s
Cabinet compared the Canada thistle to pride in 1837: “cut it down seven
times in a season; and each time it will spring up with fresh vigor.”35
These diverse uses of the Canada thistle demonstrate the different ways
that early national americans were differentiating themselves from their imperial parent. That the Canada thistle entered the culture in the years leading
up to the second battle in what might be considered a long british colonial
civil war is significant, for “mr. madison’s War” was supposed to finally complete the job of the revolution and rout monarchy completely from the field.
but it had not. The british had proved to be intransigent, deeply rooted, and
dauntingly tough to eradicate—just like the Canada thistle. reviling the
Canada thistle played its part in developing an american exceptionalist identity. undaunted by invading weeds and swarming flies, attacked in its very
backyard, the united States, the flower of enlightenment thinking, still managed to bloom and prosper. its flowering in the forms of canals, railroads, and
overnight cities was beautiful and obvious for the entire world to see, a manifest beauty explained and accentuated by the eponymous and ubiquitous weed
that must be from Canada.36
but C. arvense spread its seed democratically throughout the region and
without consideration for political ideology: a product of the expansion of
colonialism on both sides of the border. While british Canada and the united
States followed different economic paths, they still disturbed the land and
caused the thistle to spread. The Canada thistle brings into comparison two
seemingly different types of polity, a set of colonies and a nation-state, and
reveals their fundamental similarity. They were both spreading the thistle because they both were colonizing indigenous lands, albeit with different aims.
in this, the transnational biotic phenomenon of C. arvense highlights the unexceptionalism of united States colonialism.
on the other hand the undiscriminating thistle offers a clear snapshot of
the differences in practice and outcome of these two different colonialisms.
even though C. arvense did not originate in Canada, the reality was that Canadians were producing a lot of thistles. Thus, while the different colonialisms
on either side of the border both produced thistles, the confluence of the presence of thistles, a faltering british colonial monocultural economy contrasting
with a prospering diversified american economy, and the post-revolutionary

discourse along the border, all caused C. arvense to become Canadian and
contributed to the emergence of an american exceptionalist identity.37
but locating a possible origin-point of american exceptionalism is less important than recognizing its pernicious harvest. it allowed the united States
to justify its abrogation of indigenous sovereignty, its calls for the removal of
indigenous peoples from their homes, and its theft of indigenous lands. according to the highest jurist in new york State, Chancellor James Kent, “to
leave the indian in possession of the country, was to leave the country in a
wilderness.” in his opinion indians “enjoy[ed] no higher title to the soil than
that founded on simple occupancy.” Kent published his influential Commentaries on American Law before the passage of the indian removal act, a law
that, while it only offered to compensate native americans who voluntarily
moved west of the mississippi, still committed the nation to paying for a policy that might be labeled “ethnic cleansing” today. To Kent and others who
supported indian removal (and many did not), native peoples were the human
analog to Canada’s weed: they had to be pulled up if america was to grow
strong. in letting the united States shrug off the mantle of colonizer while simultaneously pointing to the “real” colonizer north of the border, the Canada
thistle allowed early national americans to begin the process of convincing
themselves that they were not colonial.38
it is probable that Kent had never seen an indian’s farm, for if he had, he
would have seen bountiful growth and probably few thistles. Two broad forms
of indigenous resource extraction existed in the borderland region—hunting
and gathering for more northern peoples and hunting, gathering, and farming
for peoples further south. The methods employed by indigenous peoples in
these extractions did not promote thistle growth but in fact discouraged it. indigenes husbanded game populations through forest management practices
like burning, which cleared out weeds. They also deforested in a piecemeal
fashion, which further minimized thistle growth. indigenes planted their crops
in small clearings following the Three Sisters complex—corn, beans, and
squash—that maximized yields through nitrogen-fixing, minimized labor, and
discouraged weed growth. They extracted resources, for example, the passenger pigeon, which euro-americans would hunt to extinction by the end of the
nineteenth century, in such a way as to ensure sustainable harvests.39
These kinds of indigenous agricultural technologies produced bountiful
yields for haudenosaunee people who lived in what became the colony and
then the state of new york. before the revolution in 1748 the Swedish scien536

The Canada Thistle

tist, Pehr Kalm, described the “corn, wild kidney beans of several kinds,
pumpkins . . . squashes, a kind of gourd, watermelons, and [other] melons” in
the fields of the mohawk community of Kanehsatake. Pennsylvanian John
bartram and friends “passed through an old [onondaga] town [in 1851 and] .
. . found plumbs [sic], peaches, and noble clusters of large grapes growing,”
which they feasted on around their camp that night. during the revolution,
Tjerck beekman, a lieutenant in the Continental army, toasted independence
day on July 5, 1779 in a Cayuga field with his comrades and raised his tankard
to “Civilization or death to all Savages.” on august 12 he burned the village
of Chemung to the ground, making note of the bountiful harvests; he destroyed
“about 2000 bushels of Corn besides a large Quantity of beans &c &c.” before they were done, beekman and his comrades razed forty more villages,
burned 160,000 bushels of corn in the field, girdled thousands of fruit trees,
and slaughtered hundreds of head of livestock.40
With so many fewer weeds to contend with, it should come as no surprise
that the region’s indigenous peoples had a more positive view of thistles. all
three major indigenous nations that straddled the border—the Wabanki, the
haudenosaunee, and the anishnaabeg—appeared to regard the thistle positively. They valued gôwiz-ak (Wabanaki), Onöni’dá (Seneca, haudenosaunee), and mazaanens+ag (anishnaabeg), as a useful plant for treating
a variety of ailments from high blood pressure, to varicose veins, intestinal
worms, mouth sores, and lung trouble. Far from considering the thistle
“cursed” the haudenosaunee accorded it a special role in the very founding
text of their confederacy, the great law of Peace, which begins with these
words:
With the statesmen of the league of the Five nations, i plant the Tree of great
Peace. i plant it in your territory, Atotarho, and the onondaga nation; in the territory of you who are the Firekeepers. i name the tree Tsioneratasekowa, the
great White Pine. under the shade of this Tree of great Peace, we spread the
soft, white, feathery down of the globe Thistle as seats for you, Atotarho, and
your cousin statesmen.

The “i” in this declaration was the peacemaker, an iroquoian man who descended from the north shore of lake ontario into the lands of the five nations
south of the lake with a message of peace. These nations—the mohawk,
oneida, onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and later Tuscarora—had been warring
for generations. The peacemaker pinpointed a volatile onondaga sachem537

shaman named Tadodahoh (atotarho) as a problem and “combed the snakes
out of his hair” by making onondaga the center of the confederacy and creating special seats cushioned with thistledown from which he and his other
“cousin lords [could watch] the Council Fire of the Confederacy of the Five
nations . . . and transact[ed] all [its] affairs.”41
it is unclear if this haudenosaunee “thistledown” came from C. arvense or
one of the other thistle species of north america. but, does that really matter,
when what was important was the striking divergence in meanings these different cultures attached to the thistle? Kent and many other euro-americans
could not perceive actual indigenous agricultural practices, nor could they
conceive of a nation where thistles were anything other than weeds and deserving of extirpation. They also could not see indigenous peoples’ sovereignty, nor see how indigenes could remain in their homes while uS citizens
grew and spread all around them. They gazed at “the other” through the optics
of their inherited agri-culture, and later through the distortions of exceptionalist privilege, and saw weeds and a doomed race. Thus, C. arvense could be
called the flower of conquest.42
